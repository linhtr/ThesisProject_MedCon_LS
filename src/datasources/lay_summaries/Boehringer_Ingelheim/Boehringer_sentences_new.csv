1,This summary describes the results of the study.
2,We thank all patients who took part in this study.
3,You helped to answer important questions about empagliflozin and the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
4,What was this study about?
5,The purpose of this study was to find out whether a medicine called empagliflozin helps patients with type 1 diabetes who are using insulin.
6,Why was the study needed?
7,Patients with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin to control their blood sugar levels.
8,"But even with insulin, some patients are not able to control their blood sugar levels very well."
9,Patients with type 1 diabetes can also have other problems like weight gain or hypoglycaemia.
10,Hypoglycaemia is when blood sugar levels are too low.
11,New medicines are needed to help patients with type 1 diabetes.
12,Which medicines were studied?
13,We studied a medicine called empagliflozin that is already used to treat type 2 diabetes.
14,This medicine helps the kidneys remove sugar from the blood.
15,The sugar is removed from the body in the urine.
16,Empagliflozin is a tablet that patients swallow once a dayWe compared empagliflozin with placebo to find out how well empagliflozin works.
17,Placebo tablets looked like empagliflozin but did not contain any medicine.
18,All patients in the study were already taking insulin.
19,They continued to take insulin during the study.
20,29 May 2019 BI 1245.72 Page 2 of 5Who participated in the study?
21,Adult patients with type 1 diabetes could take part in this study.
22,They had to be at least 18 years old.
23,They also had to have been taking insulin for at least 1 year before the start of the study.
24,"Overall, 975 patients were treated in this study."
25,There were 477 men and 498 women.
26,The average age was 43 years.
27,The youngest patient was 18 years old and the oldest was 80 years old.
28,The table below shows the numbers of patients in different regions who took part in the study.
29,"Region Countries Number of PatientsEurope Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom609North America Canada, United States 249Latin America Mexico 56Pacific Australia, New Zealand 36Africa South Africa 25How was this study done?"
30,The study started with a 6-week period during which the study doctors paid special attention to each patient s diabetes treatments.
31,They checked that each patient was getting the best possible insulin dose.
32,The patients were then divided into 4 groups of almost equal size.
33,Every patient had an equal chance of being in a certain group.
34,The groups were:Empagliflozin 2.5 mg group: patients took 1 tablet of 2.5 mg empagliflozin per dayEmpagliflozin 10 mg group: patients took 1 tablet of 10 mg empagliflozin per dayEmpagliflozin 25 mg group: patients took 1 tablet of 25 mg empagliflozin per dayPlacebo group: patients took 1 placebo tablet per day29 May 2019 BI 1245.72 Page 3 of 5The patients and the study doctors did not know in which group the patients were.
35,All patients continued their insulin treatment during the study.
36,"During the study, the doctors did a measurement called HbA1c."
37,The is a measure of much sugar on average was in the blood over the last 12 weeks.
38,We wanted to know how much the blood sugar levels changed after 26 weeks of treatment.
39,Patients visited the study doctors regularly.
40,"During these visits, the study doctors collected information about the patients health."
41,The doctors also checked the patients for any unwanted effects.
42,They also looked for signs of diabetic ketoacidosis.
43,Ketoacidosis is a serious complication that can affect patients with type 1 diabetes.
44,What were the results of this study?
45,"For 6 weeks before the study, the study doctors checked that each patient got the best possible insulin dose."
46,"During this time, the blood sugar control of the patients improved."
47,The patients then started treatment with empagliflozin or placebo.
48,"After 26 weeks of treatment, all 3 doses of empagliflozin led to further reductions in HbA1c."
49,This means that the patients who took empagliflozin improved further their blood sugar control.
50,"But for patients who took placebo, there was no improvement in blood sugar control."
51,"For these patients, HbA1c increased after 26 weeks."
52,"To measure how well the treatment worked, we calculated the changes in HbA1c in all 4 groups, (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg empagliflozin groups and the placebo group)."
53,"Taking the placebo group as a reference, we found the following reductions in HbA1c: In the 2.5 mg empagliflozin group, the reduction was 0.28% In the 10 mg empagliflozin group, the reduction was 0.45% In the 25 mg empagliflozin group, the reduction was 0.52%Although the HbA1c reductions were higher in the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin groups, there were also more cases of ketoacidosis."
54,6 patients (2.4%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 6 patients (2.4%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg group had ketoacidosis.
55,3 patients (1.2%) in the placebo group had ketoacidosis.
56,"In the 2.5 mg empagliflozin group, there were2 patients (0.8%) who had ketoacidosis."
57,Another problem that people with diabetes sometimes have is hypoglycaemia.
58,This means that the blood sugar level falls too low.
59,"In this study, we checked how many patients had hypoglycaemia."
60,We found that patients who took empagliflozin did not have morehypoglycaemia than patients who took placebo.
61,People with type 1 diabetes tend to gain weight easily.
62,It can also be difficult for them to lose weight.
63,The patients who took 2.5 mg empagliflozin lost an average of about 1.5 kg of body weight.
64,The patients who took the 10 mg and 25 mg doses of empagliflozin lost an average of about 3 kg of body weight.
65,Patients who took placebo did not lose weight.
66,29 May 2019 BI 1245.72 Page 4 of 5Were there any unwanted effects?
67,Unwanted effects are any health problems that the study doctors thought were caused by empagliflozin or placebo.
68,"In this study, 70 out of 241 patients (29%) treated with empagliflozin 2.5 mg had unwanted effects."
69,94 out of 248 patients (38%) treated with empagliflozin 10 mg had unwanted effects.
70,96 out of 245 patients (39%) treated with empagliflozin 25 mg had unwanted effects.
71,56 out of 241 patients (23%) treated with placebo had unwanted effects.
72,The most common unwanted effects seen in at least 5% of patients in any of the treatment groups are shown in the table below.
73,"Empagliflozin2.5 mg:241 patientsEmpagliflozin 10 mg:248 patientsEmpagliflozin25 mg:245 patientsPlacebo:241 patientsToo little sugar in the blood (hypoglycaemia)49 patients(20%)50 patients(20%)51 patients(21%)40 patients(17%)Higher levels of ketones in the blood (blood ketone body increased)2 patients(1%)13 patients(5%)5 patients(2%)3 patients(1%)Some unwanted effects were serious because they required a visit to or a longer stay in hospital, or were life-threatening."
74,Unwanted effects were also serious if the doctor thought they were serious for any other reason.
75,"In this study, 5 patients (2%) treated with empagliflozin 2.5 mg had serious unwanted effects."
76,8 patients (3%) treated with 10 mg empagliflozin had serious unwanted effects.
77,6 patients (2%) treated with 25 mg empagliflozin had serious unwanted effects.
78,1 patient (less than 1%) treated with placebo had serious unwanted effects.
79,Are there additional studies?

109,We thank everyone who took part in this study.
110,You helped to answer important questions about BI 443651.
112,The purpose of this study was to find out how well healthy people and people with cystic fibrosis tolerate BI 443651 compared with placebo.
113,BI 443651 was being developed to treat diseases of the lungs and airways.
114,"This study had 2 parts, and each part is described separately in the following sections."
115,Who took part in this study?
116,Part 1: healthy participants40 healthy men were in this part of the study.
117,The youngest participant was 19 years old and the oldest participant was 55 years old.
118,This part of the study was done in the United Kingdom.
119,Part 2: participants with cystic fibrosisPeople with cystic fibrosis could enrol in this part of the study.
120,24 people took part.
121,This included 16 men and 8 women.
122,The youngest participant was 22 years old and the oldest participant was 55 years old.
123,This part of the study was done in the United Kingdom and Germany.
124,31 October 2019 BI 1363.2 Page 2 of 5How was this study done?
125,"In this study, participants had to inhale BI 443651 or placebo from a special inhaler called a Respimat inhaler."
126,The placebo inhaler looked like the BI 443651 inhaler but did not contain any medicine.
127,Part 1: healthy participantsWe wanted to find out how people tolerate different doses of BI 443651.
128,"To do this, we looked at the number of participants with health problems that occurred during treatment."
129,"These are any health problems that begin after participants start taking the medicine, whether doctors think they are caused by the study medicine or not."
130,The participants were given different doses of BI 443651.
131,The first participants received a low dose and participants who started the study later received higher doses.
132,Participants took between 100 micrograms ( g) and 1800 g of BI 443651 twice a day.
133,Participants knew which BI 443651 dose they were assigned to take.
134,"However, they did not know if they were taking placebo or BI 443651."
135,The doctors did not know this either.
136,Every participant had 4 times the chance of taking BI 443651 compared to placebo.
137,Treatment lasted 6.5 days.
138,Part 2: participants with cystic fibrosisWe also wanted to find out how well people with cystic fibrosis tolerate BI 443651.
139,We looked at the number of participants with health problems that occurred during treatmentin this part of the study as well.
140,"All participants received both BI 443651 and placebo, but not at the same time."
141,The participants were divided into 2 groups.
142,1 group started by taking BI 443651 for 13.5 days.
143,Then they switched to take placebo for 13.5 days.
144,The other group started by taking placebofor 13.5 days.
145,Then they switched to take BI 443651 for 13.5 days.
146,The participants had to wait at least 30 days between switching treatments.
147,Participants took 1 dose of 600 g BI 443651 twice a day or 1 dose of placebo twice a day.
148,Participants and doctors did not know if the participants took placebo or BI 443651.
149,31 October 2019 BI 1363.2 Page 3 of 5What were the results of this study?
150,Participants in both parts of the study had health problems that occurred during treatment.
151,Part 1: healthy participants 27 out of 32 participants (84%) in the BI 443651 groups had health problems that occurred during treatment.
152,3 out of 8 participants (38%) in the placebo group had health problems that occurred during treatment.
153,Participants who took higher doses of BI 443651 had more health problems than thosetaking the lowest dose or placebo.
154,Part 2: participants with cystic fibrosis 13 out of 22 participants (59%) had health problems that occurred during treatmentwith BI 443651.
155,14 out of 24 participants (58%) had health problems that occurred during treatment with placebo.
156,Did the participants have any unwanted effects?
157,"Yes, participants in both parts of the study had unwanted effects."
158,Unwanted effects are any health problems that the doctors think were caused by the study medicines.
159,This means that the unwanted effects are a subset of the health problems discussed in the previous section.
160,Part 1: healthy participants17 out of 32 participants (53%) in the BI 443651 groups had unwanted effects.
161,12 participants had changes in the sense of taste (dysgeusia) and 10 participants had a cough.
162,None of the unwanted effects were serious.
163,No participants in the placebo group had unwanted effects.
164,Participants who took the lowest dose of BI 443651 or placebo did not have any unwanted effects.
165,Participants taking at least 400 g of BI 443651 experienced unwanted effects.
166,"As the doses increased, there were more unwanted effects."
167,31 October 2019 BI 1363.2 Page 4 of 5Part 2: participants with cystic fibrosis4 out of 22 participants (18%) had unwanted effects while taking BI 443651.

201,It describes how researchers did the study and what the results were.
202,We have written this summary for the general public.
204,You helped to answer important questions about dabigatran and the treatment of stroke.
206,This study included patients who had a type of stroke called embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS).
207,Researchers compared 2 different treatments for preventing further strokes.
208,They wanted to find out whether a medicine called dabigatran is more effective than aspirin.
209,Why was this study needed?
210,Patients who have had a stroke have an increased risk of another stroke.
211,Some strokes are caused by a blood clot.
212,Patients with this type of stroke take different medicines against blood clotting.
213,The type of medicine that works the best for these patients usually depends on how the blood clot formed in the bloodstream.
214,Some blood clots form around fatty deposits in the vessels.
215,"For some strokes, doctors do not know what causes the blood clot to form."
216,This type of stroke is called ESUS.
217,Patients with ESUS often take aspirin to help prevent further strokes.
218,But doctors do not know what the most effective treatment for ESUS is.
219,This study was done to find out if dabigatran was more effective than aspirin at preventing another stroke.
221,Researchers studied the anti-blood-clotting medicine called dabigatran.
222,Dabigatran slows down blood clotting.
223,It reduces the amount of certain proteins needed to form clots.
224,Dabigatran is taken as a capsule by mouth.
225,05 March 2019 BI 1160.189 Page 3 of 6Researchers compared dabigatran to another anti-blood-clotting medicine known as aspirin.
226,Aspirin works by preventing small blood cells called platelets from forming clumps that are needed to form clots.
227,Aspirin is taken as a tablet by mouth.
229,Patients could take part in this study if they had a type of stroke called ESUS within the previous 3 to 6 months.
230,"Overall, 5390 patients took part in the study."
231,3403 were men and 1987 were women.
232,"Onaverage, patients were 64 years old."
233,The youngest patient was 18 years old and the oldest patient was 94 years old.
234,The table below shows the number of patients by geographical region and country.

236,The patients were divided into 2 groups.
237,One group of patients received dabigatran and the other group received aspirin.
238,Every patient had an equal chance of being in the dabigatrangroup or in the aspirin group.
239,Patients were to take the treatment for between 6 months and 3.5 years.
240,The patients did not know which treatment they were taking.
241,The doctors did not know either.
242,Patients in the dabigatran group took either 220 milligrams (mg) or 300 mg every day.
243,Theytook dabigatran as 1 capsule twice per day.
244,Patients in the aspirin group took 1 tablet of 100 mg aspirin once daily.
245,05 March 2019 BI 1160.189 Page 4 of 6Patients visited their doctors regularly.
246,"During the visits, the doctors collected information on each patient s health."
247,"During the study, researchers compared how many patients had strokes in the dabigatran group and the aspirin group."
248,Researchers also checked whether patients had major bleeding problems during the study.
249,A bleeding problem was major if at least 1 of the following occurred: The patient needed a transfusion of blood.
250,The bleeding occurred in an important place in the body (such as in the brain).
251,The bleeding led to the death of the patient.
253,The chances of having a stroke during the study were about the same for patients who took dabigatran and for patients who took aspirin.
254,"For this analysis, all participants in the study were included."
255,"In the dabigatran group, 177 out of 2695 patients (6.6%) had a stroke."
256,"In the aspirin group, 207 out of 2695 patients (7.7%) had a stroke."
257,Researchers did statistical tests on the results.
258,They found that it was likely that the difference between the treatment groups came about by chance.
259,The chances of having a major bleeding problem during the study were also similar for each treatment.
260,"For this analysis, all participants who received any study treatment were included."
261,"In the dabigatran group, 65 out of 2676 patients (2.4%) had a major bleeding problem."
262,"In the aspirin group, 48 out of 2674 patients (1.8%) had a major bleeding problem."
264,Unwanted effects are any health problems that the doctors thought were caused by the study medicines.
265,"In this study, 503 out of 2676 patients (19%) in the dabigatran group had unwanted effects."
266,344 out of 2674 patients (13%) in the aspirin group had unwanted effects.
267,The most common unwanted effects seen in at least 25 patients taking either dabigatran or aspirin are shown in the table below.

315,We thank all study participants.
316,You helped to answer important questions about nintedaniband the treatment of IPF.
318,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease that causes scarring of the tissue inside the lungs.
319,The lungs become thick and stiff (fibrotic).
320,This makes breathing difficult.
321,The word 'idiopathic' means that doctors do not know the cause of the lung scarring.
322,"Common symptoms of IPF are shortness of breath, persistent dry cough, and enlargement (clubbing) of fingertips."
323,Nintedanib is a medicine that is used to slow down the progression of IPF.
324,The purpose of the study was to measure how nintedanib affects a certain protein in the blood called CRPM.
325,CRPM has been shown in other clinical studies to increase as IPF worsens.
326,"We expected that if nintedanib had an effect on CRPM, it could provide more information about how nintedanib works."
328,All participants in this study had IPF.
329,"Overall, 346 participants took part in the study."
330,This included 262 men and 84 women.
331,The average age was 70 years.
332,The youngest participant was 49 years old and the oldest participant was 91 years old.
333,"30 September 2019 BI 1199.227 Page 3 of 6This study was done in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America."

336,This study had 2 parts.
337,The first part lasted for 12 weeks and the second part lasted for 40 weeks.
338,"In the first part of the study, the participants were divided into 2 groups."
339,It was decided by chance which participants were in each group.
340,The groups were: Nintedanib group: participants took 1 tablet of 150 mg nintedanib twice per day Placebo group: participants took 1 placebo tablet twice per dayPlacebo tablets looked like nintedanib but did not contain any medicine.
341,116 participants were in the nintedanib group and 230 participants were in the placebo group.
342,The participants and doctors did not know whether the participants were in the nintedanib group or in the placebo group.
343,We wanted to know if there was a difference in the amount of CRPM in the blood after taking nintedanib for 12 weeks.
344,We compared the amount of CRPM in participants who took nintedanib with the amount of CRPM in participants who took placebo.
345,"In the second part of the study, all participants took 1 tablet of 150 mg nintedanib twice per day for 40 weeks."
346,All participants knew that they were now taking nintedanib.
347,Participants who were taking nintedanib in part 1 continued to take nintedanib.
348,Participants who weretaking placebo in part 1 switched to nintedanib in part 2.
349,We wanted to know if there was adifference between treatments.
350,We measured how well the lungs worked at the end of the study compared to the beginning of the study.
351,We also wanted to know if there was a difference in the number of participants who died.
352,Participants visited the doctors regularly.
353,"During these visits, the doctors collected information about the participant s health."
354,30 September 2019 BI 1199.227 Page 4 of 6What were the results of this study?
355,"After 12 weeks, the average change in the amount of CRPM in the blood was not differentbetween groups."
356,The groups were participants taking nintedanib compared to participants taking placebo.
357,"By the end of the study, similar percentages of participants in both treatment groups had decreased lung function or had died."
358,29 out of 116 participants (25%) who took nintedanibthroughout the whole study had decreased lung function or had died.
359,70 out of 230 participants (30%) who took placebo during the first 12 weeks had decreased lung function or had died.
360,Did participants have any unwanted effects?
361,"Yes, participants in both groups had unwanted effects."
362,Unwanted effects are health problems that the doctors think were caused by the study medicines.
363,"During the first part of the study, 66 out of 116 participants (57%) in the nintedanib group had unwanted effects."
364,64 out of 230 participants (28%) in the placebo group had unwanted effects.

369,2 participants out of 230 participants (less than 1%) in the placebo group had serious unwanted effects.
370,All participants took nintedanib during the second part of the study.
371,"During this period, 256 participants out of 333 participants (77%) had unwanted effects."
372,The most common unwanted effects were the same as in the first part of the study.

413,You helped researchers answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of scleroderma-related lung fibrosis.
415,"This study was done to find out whether a medicine called nintedanib helps patients with scleroderma, who have lung fibrosis due to their disease."
416,Scleroderma is a rare disease that can cause thickening and hardening (fibrosis) of the skin and other organs.
417,"In many people with scleroderma, the disease causes lung fibrosis (also called interstitial lung disease)."
418,Lung fibrosis means that the lungs become stiffer and thicker.
419,This can make breathing difficult.
420,Lung fibrosis often worsens over time.
422,There are not many treatment options for patients with scleroderma who have lung fibrosis due to their disease.
423,New treatments are needed.
425,We studied the medicine nintedanib.
426,Researchers think that nintedanib can block biological signals that take place in the process of tissue hardening (fibrosis).
427,"Nintedanib is used to treat a disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is another type of lung fibrosis."
428,"In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung function worsens as the disease progresses."
429,Nintedanib can help to slow down worsening of lung function.
430,Nintedanib is taken as a capsule that patients swallow.
431,"Half of the patients in this study took nintedanib, and the other half took placebo."
432,"The placebo capsules looked just like the nintedanib capsules, but did not contain any medicine."
433,We compared nintedanib with placebo to find out whether nintedanib works in patients who have scleroderma with lung fibrosis.
434,14 May 2019 BI 1199.214 Page 3 of 8 Who participated in the study?
435,Adult patients with scleroderma who had lung fibrosis due to their disease participated in the study.
436,A total of 576 patients took part in the study.
437,433 patients (75%) were women and 143 patients (25%) were men.
438,The average age was 54 years.
439,The youngest patient was 20 years old and the oldest patient was 79 years old.
440,"This study was done in Europe, Canada and the USA, Asia, and other regions."
441,The table below shows where the study was done.
442,"Region Countries Number of patients Europe Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom 266 Canada and USA Canada, United States 142 Asia China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand 130 Other regions Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Israel, Mexico 38 How was this study done?"
444,It was decided by chance who got into which group.
445,"One group of patients took nintedanib, and the other group of patients took placebo."
446,Each patient had an equal chance of being in the nintedanib group or in the placebo group.
447,Patients did not know if they were taking nintedanib or placebo.
449,Patients took the nintedanib capsules or the placebo capsules twice a day.
450,All patients started on the dose of 150 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
451,"If patients had unwanted effects, the doctors could lower the dose to 100 mg twice a day."
452,Patients could also stop taking the capsules for a while.
453,14 May 2019 BI 1199.214 Page 4 of 8 It was planned that patients stay in the study for at least 1 year.
454,The maximum amount of time patients were in the study was around 2 years.
455,"During this time, the patients visited their doctors regularly."
456,"At these visits, the doctors collected information on each patient's health."
457,"To see if nintedanib could slow down the loss of lung function, a lung function test was used."
458,The test measured in millilitres (mL) how much air a patient could exhale into a device.
459,"This measurement is called Forced Vital Capacity, or FVC."
460,We measured how much FVC changed over 1 year.
461,A decrease in FVC over 1 year meant a loss of lung function.
462,We also wanted to know whether nintedanib can reduce skin thickening.
463,"To test this, doctors checked skin thickness on different parts of patients bodies."
464,"We then calculated a score, called a modified Rodnan skin score, or mRSS."
465,We compared the skin thickness scores at the beginning of the study with scores after 1 year of being in the study.
466,We also wanted to know whether nintedanib can improve patients' quality of life related to their health.
467,"For this, patients answered a set of questions called the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)."
468,Patients answered questions about how much their breathing problems were troubling them and how this affected their lives.
469,We used the answers of each patient to calculate the SGRQ score.
470,We compared the scores at the beginning of the study with scores after 1 year of being in the study.
471,14 May 2019 BI 1199.214 Page 5 of 8 What were the results of this study?
472,"As scleroderma-related lung fibrosis progresses, a loss of lung function is expected."
473,The graph shows the average yearly loss of lung function in patients who took nintedanib (blue bar on the left) and patients who took placebo (green bar on the right).
474,"On average, after 1 year of treatment, nintedanib slowed down the loss of lung function by 44%."
475,We did statistical tests on the results.
476,These tests showed it was unlikely that the difference between the treatment groups happened by chance.
477,Nintedanib did not reduce skin thickening.
478,"In both the nintedanib group and the placebo group, on average, skin thickening decreased slightly after 1 year."
479,"But, there was no meaningful difference between the groups."
480,Nintedanib did not improve the patients quality of life related to health as measured by the SGRQ.
481,"Both groups, on average, had only very small changes in the SGRQ score after 1 year."
482,There was no meaningful difference between the groups.
483,14 May 2019 BI 1199.214 Page 6 of 8 Did patients have any unwanted effects?
485,"In this study, 238 out of 288 patients (83%) who took nintedanib had unwanted effects."
486,125 out of 288 patients (43%) who took placebo had unwanted effects.
487,The following table shows the most common unwanted effects seen in patients who took nintedanib.
488,"Nintedanib (288 patients) Placebo (288 patients) Diarrhoea 197 patients (68%) 57 patients (20%) Nausea 71 patients (25%) 21 patients (7%) Vomiting 51 patients (18%) 12 patients (4%) Stomach pain 22 patients (8%) 9 patients (3%) Weight loss 20 patients (7%) 4 patients (1%) Decreased appetite 18 patients (6%) 8 patients (3%) Some unwanted effects were serious because they required a visit to hospital or a longer stay in hospital, were life-threatening, or fatal."
489,Unwanted effects were also serious if they led to disability or if the doctor thought they were serious for any other reason.
490,"In this study, 14 patients (5%) in the nintedanib group had serious unwanted effects."
491,6 patients (2%) in the placebo group had serious unwanted effects.
492,1 patient in the nintedanib group died from an unwanted effect.

536,This study included patients who had a type of stroke called CVT.
537,Researchers compared 2 different treatments for preventing blood clots/further strokes.
539,Patients who have had CVT usually take medicines against blood clotting.
540,These medicines can lower the risk of further strokes.
541,But anti-blood-clotting medicines can also increase the risk of bleeding.
542,The medicine that is most often prescribed for patients who had a CVT is warfarin.
543,This study was needed to find out whether another medicine called dabigatran is as effective and safe as warfarin at preventing blood clots.
545,We studied the anti-blood-clotting medicine called dabigatran.
549,We compared dabigatran to a medicine known as warfarin.
550,Warfarin is another anti-blood-clotting medicine that works in a different way to prevent blood clots.
551,Warfarin is taken as a tablet by mouth.
552,30 May 2019 BI 1160.248 Page 3 of 5Who took part in this study?
553,Patients could take part in this study if they had a type of stroke called CVT.
554,They were to have already received a type of anti-blood-clotting treatment right after the CVT event and for 5 to 15 days after.

661,"28 May 2019 BI 1245.69 Page 3 of 5During the study, the doctors did a measurement called HbA1c."
662,This is a measure of how much sugar on average was in the blood over the last 12 weeks.
665,"During these visits, the study doctors collected information about the patient s health."
673,"After 26 weeks of treatment, both doses of empagliflozin led to further reductions in HbA1c."
674,This means that the patients who took empagliflozin further improved their blood sugar control.
677,"To measure how well the treatment worked, we calculated the changes in HbA1c in all 3 groups, (10 mg, 25 mg empagliflozin groups and the placebo group)."
678,"Taking the placebo group as a reference, we found the following reductions in HbA1c: In the 10 mg empagliflozin group, the reduction was 0.54% In the 25 mg empagliflozin group, the reduction was 0.53%In the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin groups, there were also more cases of ketoacidosis than in the placebo group."
679,15 patients (6.2%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 10 patients (4.1%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg group had ketoacidosis.
689,28 May 2019 BI 1245.69 Page 4 of 5Were there any unwanted effects?
690,Unwanted effects are any health problems that the doctors thought were caused by empagliflozin or placebo.
691,"In this study after 52 weeks, 127 out of 243 patients (52%) treated with empagliflozin 10 mg had unwanted effects."

741,The purpose of this study was to find out whether adding a medicine called sildenafil totreatment with a medicine called nintedanib helps patients with advanced IPF more than nintedanib alone.
743,"In IPF, the lungs become scarred and stiff."
745,A medicine called nintedanib is used to treat IPF.
746,We wanted to check if adding another medicine that works in a different way than nintedanib helps patients more than nintedanib alone.
748,We studied the combination of 2 medicines called nintedanib and sildenafil.
749,Nintedanib can help to slow down the worsening of IPF.
751,Sildenafil is a medicine used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and other conditions.

831,It is written for the general public.
832,It includes information about how researchers did the study and what the results were.
834,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of lung cancer."
836,Patients in this study had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
837,"They had previously received therapy, but their cancer had returned or spread to other parts of their body (metastasised)."
838,"During this study, researchers compared 2 different treatments for NSCLC."
839,One treatment was a combination of nintedanib and docetaxel.
840,The other treatment was docetaxel alone (docetaxel and placebo).
841,They wanted to find out if the combination was more effective than docetaxel alone in preventing further growth of NSCLC.
842,Researchers also wanted to find out which patients would benefit most from this treatment combination.
843,This study started in December 2008 and finished in November 2017.
845,NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer.
846,"Unfortunately, NSCLC is often diagnosed late."
847,This means that surgery is no longer possible.
848,The cancer has already spread into other parts of the body (metastasised) and is considered 'advanced'.
849,There are several treatments for advanced NSCLC.
850,Sometimes these treatments make patients feel sick.
851,Sometimes the treatments don't stop the cancer from growing.
852,"Therefore, new medicines are needed to treat NSCLC."

854,105 Jul 2018 Page 2 of 6Which medicines were studied?
855,Nintedanib is a medicine that helps to stop cancer from growing and spreading.
856,Nintedanibblocks the development of new blood vessels in growing tumours.
857,It is used to treat a certain type of lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel).
858,Nintedanib is taken as a capsule by mouth.
859,Docetaxel is used as standard treatment for patients with NSCLC that has returned or spread after initial treatment.
860,It is a type of chemotherapy and given by infusion into a vein.
861,This means it is dripped into a vein through a plastic tube and needle.
863,All patients in this study were adults with NSCLC.
864,They had already received treatment when they entered the study.
865,The cancer had returned or spread after that initial treatment.
866,"Overall, 1314 patients took part in the study."
867,The study included 955 men and 359 women.
868,The average age was 60 years.
869,The youngest patient was 26 years old.
870,The oldest patient was 84 years old.
872,"Geographical Region Countries Number of PatientsEurope Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgian Republic, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom985 patientsAsia China, India, South Korea 308 patientsSouth Africa South Africa 21 patientsHow was this study done?"
875,One group received nintedanib and docetaxel.
876,"The other group received placebo and docetaxel, or in other words, docetaxel alone."
878,"In this way, the patients did not know which treatment they were taking."
881,105 Jul 2018 Page 3 of 6Patients in the nintedanib and docetaxel group started on a nintedanib dose of 200 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
882,The doctors decreased the dose if the patients had health problems that they could not tolerate.
883,Patients in the placebo and docetaxel group took placebo capsules twice a day.
884,All patients began at a dose of docetaxel based on their body size.
885,They were given 75 mg per square metre of body surface area once every 3 weeks.
886,The doctors decreased the doseif the patients had side effects that they could not tolerate.
887,"To compare nintedanib and docetaxel with docetaxel alone, the researchers measured progression-free survival ."
888,This is the time from starting the study medicines until the cancer grew or the patient died.
889,Researchers also measured the time from starting the medicines until the patients died from cancer or from any other cause.
890,This is called overall survival .
891,Researchers also wanted to know which patients could be helped the most by addition of nintedanib to docetaxel.
892,"They looked at progression-free survival and overall survival of: All patients, and Patients with a special type of NSCLC called adenocarcinomaPatients visited their doctor regularly."
893,"During the visits, the doctors collected information oneach patient s health."
895,"For all patients, the progression-free survival was 3.4 months on average for patients who took nintedanib and docetaxel."
896,It was 2.7 months for patients who took docetaxel alone.
897,Researchers calculated the risk of the cancer growing or the patient dying.
898,It was 21% lower for patients who took nintedanib and docetaxel than for patients who took docetaxel alone.
899,Researchers used statistical tests on the results to check if the results were reliable.
900,They found that this difference in progression-free survival was not likely due to chance.
901,These results were based on an analysis conducted while the study was still in progress during 2010.
902,A follow-up analysis in 2013 also confirmed these results.
903,"From the follow-up analysis, researchers found there was a small difference in overall survival between treatments when all patients were compared."
904,The average overall survival was 10.1 months for all patients who took nintedanib and docetaxel.
905,It was 9.1 months for all patients who took docetaxel alone.
907,They found that this difference in overall survival was likely due to chance.
908,This means it was probably not caused by nintedanib.
909,"For patients with adenocarcinoma who took nintedanib and docetaxel, the average progression-free survival was 4.2 months."
910,It was 2.8 months for patients with adenocarcinoma who took docetaxel alone.
912,105 Jul 2018 Page 4 of 6Researchers calculated the risk of the cancer growing or the patient dying for patients with adenocarcinoma.
913,It was 16% lower for patients who took nintedanib and docetaxel than for patients who took docetaxel alone.
916,Researchers also looked at overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma.
917,The average overall survival was 12.6 months for patients in this group who took nintedanib and docetaxel.
918,It was 10.3 months for patients in this group who took docetaxel alone.
919,The risk of dying was 17% lower for patients who took nintedanib and docetaxel than for patients who took docetaxel alone.
921,They found that this difference in overall survival was not likely due to chance.
922,These results for progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma are shown in the picture below.
923,The final results of the study were published in 2013.

984,The purpose of this study was to find out whether a medicine called nintedanib helps people with progressive lung fibrosis.
985,"Lung fibrosis causes the lung tissue to become thick, stiff, and scarred."
986,This leads to loss of lung function and can make breathing difficult.
987,"In some people, lung fibrosis is progressive."
988,This means that it worsens over time.
989,"Lung fibrosis can occur in people with interstitial lung diseases, also called ILDs."
990,ILDs affect the tissue and space around the air sacs of the lungs.
991,Lung fibrosis can occur because of inhalation of a harmful substance.
992,Lung fibrosis can also be associated with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis.
993,"However, in many people with lung fibrosis, the cause is unknown."
994,Doctors call diseases with an unknown cause idiopathic .
995,"Nintedanib is a medicine used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a type of progressive lung fibrosis."
996,"In IPF, nintedanib can help to slow down the worsening of lung function."
997,Researchers think that nintedanib can block biological signals that take place in the process of lung fibrosis.
998,"In this study, we wanted to check if nintedanib also works for other types of progressive lung fibrosis."

1011,The participants and doctors did not know who was in the nintedanib group and who was in the placebo group.
1012,"If participants had unwanted effects, the doctors could lower the dose to 100 mg twice a day or even stop their treatment for a while."
1013,25 September 2019 BI 1199.247 Page 4 of 7It was planned that participants stay in the study for at least 1 year.

1015,"During this time, the participants visited their doctors regularly."
1016,"At these visits, the doctors collected information on each participant's health."
1018,"The test measured, in millilitres, how much air a participant could exhale into a device."
1019,"This measurement is called forced vital capacity, or FVC."
1020,It indicates the volume of the lungs.

1024,We also looked at FVC in groups of participants with different patterns of fibrosis in the lungs.
1025,These patterns can be seen with computerised tomography (CT) scans of the chest.
1026,CT scans use x-rays to create images of the inside of the body.
1027,We wanted to see if the medicine worked the same in people with different patterns of fibrosis in the lungs.
1029,"Compared with placebo, nintedanib slowed down the loss of lung function in study participants."
1030,"Because the participants had progressive lung fibrosis, loss of lung function was expected."
1031,The graph below shows the average yearly loss of lung function in participants who took nintedanib (blue bar on the left) and participants who took placebo (green bar on the right).
1032,"On average, after 1 year of treatment, nintedanib slowed down the loss of lung function by 57%."
1035,These tests showed it was unlikely that the differencesbetween the treatment groups happened by chance.
1036,25 September 2019 BI 1199.247 Page 5 of 7Did participants have any unwanted effects?
1038,Unwanted effects are health problems that the doctors think were caused by nintedanib or placebo.
1039,"During 1 year of treatment, 262 out of 332 participants (79%) in the nintedanib group had unwanted effects."
1040,126 out of 331 participants (38%) in the placebo group had unwanted effects.
1042,The table also shows how many participants had each of these unwanted effects.

1044,Unwanted effects were also serious if they led to disability or the doctor thought they were serious for any other reason.
1045,"During 1 year of treatment, 21 participants (6%) in the nintedanib group had serious unwanted effects."
1046,13 participants (4%) in the placebo group had serious unwanted effects.
1047,No participants in the nintedanib group died from unwanted effects during 1 year of treatment.
1048,One participant in the placebo group died from unwanted effects.

1085,You helped researchers answer important questions about BI 443651 and the treatment of airway diseases.
1087,Researchers wanted to find out whether a medicine called BI 443651 affects the lung function of patients with asthma.
1089,BI 443651 is being developed to help patients with diseases of the lungs and airways.
1090,Researchers need to study how BI 443651 works in patients with asthma.
1091,This will help them to understand how BI 443651 works in patients with other diseases of the lungs and airways.
1093,Researchers studied the medicine BI 443651.
1094,It is being developed to treat diseases of the lungs and airways.
1095,"In this study, patients had to inhale BI 443651 from a special inhaler called a Respimat inhaler."
1096,Researchers compared different doses of BI 443651 with placebo.
1097,A placebo looks like BI 443651 but does not contain any medicine.
1098,The placebo was also inhaled from a Respimat inhaler.
1100,Patients with mild asthma could take part in this study.
1101,Some patients were already taking other medicine to treat their asthma before they started the study.
1102,"07 March 2019 BI 1363.7 Page 2 of 4Overall, 37 patients took part in this study."
1103,There were 34 men and 3 women.
1104,The average age was 37 years.
1105,The youngest patient was 23 years old and the oldest patient was 59 years old.
1106,This study was done in the United Kingdom.
1108,This study tested 3 different doses of BI 443651.
1109,"The doses were 100 g BI 443651, 400 g BI 443651, and 1200 g BI 443651."
1110,Each dose of BI 443651 was inhaled from a Respimat inhaler.
1111,The study also tested a placebo.
1112,"All patients took every dose of BI 443651 and also placebo, but not at the same time."
1113,They took each dose of BI 443651 or placebo for 2 days.
1114,"In between, patients had to wait for 2 to 4 weeks before they took another dose of BI 443651 or the placebo."
1115,"At any time, the patients did not know if they were taking BI 443651 or placebo, or which dose they were taking."
1116,"During the study, researchers checked the lung function of the patients."
1117,They used a test called a methacholine challenge test.
1118,The patients first had to take a medicine called methacholine.
1119,Then the patients had to blow as hard as they could into a machine.
1120,The machine measured how much air the patients could forcefully breathe out in 1 second (FEV1).
1121,Researchers wanted to find out if BI 443651 had an effect on the results of this test.
1122,Patients visited their doctors regularly.
1125,"The effects of the metacholine challenge test were no different when patients were taking different doses of BI 443651 or placebo, or when they were taking no study medication."
1128,In this study: 15 patients (43%) had unwanted effects while taking 100 g BI 443651.
1129,21 patients (58%) had unwanted effects while taking 400 g BI 443651.
1130,26 patients (72%) had unwanted effects while taking 1200 g BI 443651.

1164,You helped to answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of mesothelioma.
1166,We wanted to find out whether a medicine called nintedanib in combination with standardchemotherapy helps patients with a type of cancer in the lining of the lungs and chest cavity called MPM.
1168,MPM is a cancer in the lining of the lungs and chest cavity.
1169,MPM is deadly and difficult to treat.
1170,Most patients already have advanced cancer when they are diagnosed.
1171,"After beginning standard treatment with chemotherapy, patients live one year on average."
1172,The study was needed to test if adding nintedanib helps extend a patient s life further.
1174,We studied the medicine nintedanib in combination with standard pemetrexed and cisplatinchemotherapy.
1176,Nintedanib blocks the development of new blood vessels in growing tumours.
1177,It is used in combination with chemotherapy to treat a certain type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer.
1179,Pemetrexed and cisplatin is used as standard combination treatment for patients with MPM.
1180,It is a type of chemotherapy and is given by infusion into a vein.
1181,16 Aug 2019 BI 1199-0093 Page 2 of 5Who took part in this study?
1182,All patients in this study were adults with MPM.
1183,They had not been treated with surgery and had not received previous treatment with chemotherapy.
1184,"Overall, 458 patients took part in the study."
1185,The study included 334 men and 124 women.
1186,The average age was 64 years.
1187,The youngest patient was 28 years old and the oldest patient was 86 years old.

1193,One group received nintedanib with chemotherapy.
1194,"The other group received placebo with chemotherapy, or in other words, chemotherapy alone."
1198,Patients in the nintedanib with chemotherapy group started on a nintedanib dose of 200 milligrams twice a day.
1200,Patients in the placebo with chemotherapy group took placebo capsules twice a day.
1201,16 Aug 2019 BI 1199-0093 Page 3 of 5All patients began at doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin based on their body size.
1202,They were given pemetrexed and cisplatin according to the prescribing information once every 3 weeks.
1204,The standard treatment with chemotherapy took up to 6 months.
1205,"After that,patients continued with nintedanib or placebo alone."
1206,"To compare nintedanib with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone, we measured progression-free survival ."
1207,This is the time from starting the study treatment until the cancer grew or the patient died.
1208,We also measured the time from starting the study treatment until the patients died.
1213,"For patients who took nintedanib with chemotherapy, the progression-free survival was 6.8 months on average."
1214,It was 7.0 months for patients who took chemotherapy alone.
1215,The average overall survival was 14.4 months for patients in the group who took nintedanib and chemotherapy.
1216,It was 16.1 months for patients in the group who took chemotherapy alone.
1217,We did statistical tests on these results.
1218,The statistical tests showed that nintedanib with chemotherapy was not different from chemotherapy alone for progression-free survival and overall survival.

1262,You helped us to answer important questions about BI 695502 and the treatment of lung cancer.
1264,The purpose of this study was to compare 2 similar treatments for a type of lung cancer called non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC).
1265,Avastin (bevacizumab) is a medicine that is used to treat nsNSCLC.
1266,It is taken in combination with chemotherapy.
1267,BI 695502 is a medicine that is designed to be similar to Avastin .
1268,"Although BI 695502 and Avastin are very similar, they are not exactly the same because of the way they are made."
1269,"Because BI 695502 and Avastin are very similar, they should work in a similar way."
1270,This study was to find out whether BI 695502 in combination with chemotherapy works as well as Avastin in combination with chemotherapy.
1272,All patients in this study were adults with recurrent or metastatic nsNSCLC.
1273,They were to be eligible for treatment with Avastin combined with standard chemotherapy.
1274,"Overall, 663 patients took part in the study."
1275,The study included 417 men (63%) and 246 women (37%).
1276,The average age was 61 years.

1281,One was the BI 695502 with chemotherapy group and the other was the Avastin with chemotherapy group.
1282,Every patient had an equal chance of being in the BI 695502 group or in the Avastin group.
1283,Patients and doctors did not know whether the patients were in the BI 695502 group or in the Avastin group.
1284,The chemotherapy for this study was a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin.
1285,This combination is used as a standard treatment for patients with nsNSCLC that has returned or spread.
1286,Patients visited the study site every 3 weeks and received all medicines for their group as infusion into a vein.
1287,The dose given for all medicines depended on body weight.
1288,Patients received the medicines for as long as they benefited from it or wanted to.
1289,"After about two and a half years, all patients still in the study switched from BI 695502 to Avastin ."
1290,We used information only from the time up to this switch for this lay summary.
1291,"To compare BI 695502 and chemotherapy with Avastin and chemotherapy, we measured the overall response rate ."
1292,This is the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment.
1293,This was based on images of the tumours taken during treatment up to 18 weeks.
1296,22 October 2019 BI 1302-0005 Page 4 of 5What were the results of this study?
1297,We found that the overall response rate of BI 695502 with standard chemotherapy was not different from Avastin with standard chemotherapy.
1298,This means that BI 695502 works as well as Avastin when taken with chemotherapy in patients with nsNSCLC.
1301,Unwanted effects are health problems that the doctors think were caused by BI 695502 or Avastin .

1343,You helped to answer important questions about BI 695502 and the treatment of cancer.
1345,The purpose of this study was to find out whether a medicine called BI 695502 is safe to give to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) when combined with chemotherapy.
1347,BI 695502 was being developed as a product similar to the approved medicine Avastin .
1348,The addition of Avastin to chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in some patients with mCRC.
1349,"Although BI 695502 and Avastin are very similar, they are not exactly the samebecause of the way they are made."
1350,Researchers needed to learn more about BI 695502 tosee if it is safe for patients.
1352,BI 695502 is a drug that may slow or stop the growth of certain tumour types by preventing the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumour.
1353,"In this study, BI 695502 was given as an intravenous infusion (fluid dripped into a vein through a plastic tube and needle)."
1354,"The combination of the drugs leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin is part of a standardtreatment for patients with mCRC."
1355,"You may hear this combination referred to as mFOLFOX6 , which is simply a type of chemotherapy."
1356,Chemotherapy means that someone is being treated with drugs that help to fight their cancer.
1357,The drugs were given as intravenous infusions.
1358,14 June 2019 BI 1302.3 Page 2 of 5Who took part in this study?
1359,Adult patients with mCRC who had not previously been treated could take part in this study.
1360,Only patients who were not candidates for surgery to treat their cancer could be in the trial.
1361,A total of 123 patients took part in the study.
1362,This included 68 men (55%) and 55 women(45%).
1363,The average age was 58 years.

1367,Countries Number of PatientsUkraine 44United States 42Japan 30Spain 7How was this study done?
1368,We wanted to find out how safe BI 695502 is.
1369,"To find out, we looked at the amount of patients who had certain types of health problems after starting to take BI 695502."
1370,Wecompared this to studies on the same health problems that patients had after starting to take Avastin .
1371,We looked at a certain group of health problems that patients had during the study.
1372,Some of the health problems might have been caused by the study medicine.
1373,Others might have been caused by something else.
1374,The health problems that we looked at are listed in the next section.
1375,Patients came in to the study site every 2 weeks and were given intravenous infusions of all the medicines.
1376,The dose given for all medicines depended on body size.
1377,Patients remained on treatment for as long as they needed to.
1378,"After about a year and a half, we switched all patients still in the study from BI 695502 to another drug."
1379,We used information only from while they were on BI 695502 for this lay summary.

1429,You helped to answer important questions about BI 836826 and the treatment of cancer.
1431,We tested a medicine called BI 836826 in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL).
1432,The purpose of this study was to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 836826 that the patients could tolerate when given with medicines called gemcitabine and oxaliplatin.
1434,"When a new medicine is developed, researchers need to learn more about what the best dose is for patients."
1435,"DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a type of cancer."
1436,DLBCL can be difficult to treat.
1437,"Even if treatment works, the cancer can return after some time."
1438,"Therefore, new treatments are needed."
1439,This study was needed to help find the best dose of BI 836826 for patients and how it works with other medicines.
1441,BI 836826 was being developed to treat people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
1442,"In this study, BI 836826 was given as an infusion into a vein."
1443,Oxaliplatin and gemcitabine are anticancer chemotherapy drugs.
1444,They were given as an infusion into a vein.
1445,05 July 2019 BI 1270.11 Page 2 of 4Who took part in this study?
1446,Adult patients with DLBCL that had not responded to treatment or whose disease had returned could take part in this study.
1447,A total of 21 patients took part in the study.
1448,This included 11 women and 10 men.
1450,The youngest patient was 22 years old and the oldest patient was 86 years old.
1451,"This study was done in Belgium, Italy, and Spain."
1453,We wanted to find the highest dose of BI 836826 that patients could tolerate.
1454,This dose is called the maximum tolerated dose.
1455,"To find the maximum tolerated dose, we looked at how many patients had certain severe health problems that might have been caused by the treatment."
1456,These are called dose-limiting toxicities.
1457,The patients were all given BI 836826 but at different doses.
1458,The first patients to enter the study received a low dose and patients who started the study later received a higher dose.
1459,"The doses given were 25 milligrams (mg), 50 mg, and 100 mg."
1460,Patients were also given gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin.
1461,The dose given of these 2 drugs depended on the body size of the patient.
1462,Treatment was given in cycles.
1463,Each treatment cycle lasted 2 weeks.
1464,Patients received 1 dose of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin on Day 1 of the cycle and 1 dose of BI 836826 on Day 8 of the cycle.
1465,"If the patient tolerated the drugs, this treatment cycle could be repeated 5 more times."
1469,We decided to stop this study early.
1470,"Because the study was stopped early, the maximum tolerated dose could not be determined."

1695,We thank all children who took part in this study.
1696,You helped to answer important questions about tiotropium and the treatment of asthma.
1698,Researchers wanted to find out if a medicine called tiotropium helps children with asthma.
1700,Asthma is a disease that causes the airways in lungs to become narrow.
1701,"This can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath."
1702,"Asthma in children can cause school absences, visits to the emergency department, or stays in hospital."
1703,Tiotropium is a medicine that can help treat asthma.
1704,It helps to widen the airways in the lungs.
1705,There are some other medicines available to treat asthma in children.
1706,Some children with asthma need to take more than one medicine.
1707,"In this study, researchers needed to find out whether tiotropium can help children with asthma if they take it in addition to theirusual asthma medicine."
1709,Researchers studied the medicine tiotropium.
1710,Tiotropium is used to treat asthma and another lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
1711,It helps to open the airways and keeps them open all day long.
1712,This makes it easier to breathe.
1713,Tiotropium comes as a solution that needs to be inhaled.
1714,The study tested 2 different doses of tiotropium.
1715,Some children in the study took placebo instead of tiotropium.
1716,The placebo looked like tiotropium but did not contain any medicine.
1717,The children in the study used a special inhaler called the Respimat to take tiotropium or placebo.
1718,18 April 2019 BI 205.445 Page 10 of 12Who took part in this study?
1719,Children with moderate persistent asthma could take part in the study.
1720,They had to be aged between 6 and 11 years old.
1721,A total of 401 children took part.
1722,There were 264 boys (65.8%) and 137 girls (34.2%).
1723,Their average age was 8.9 years.
1724,All of the children were already taking other medicines for their asthma.

1727,The children were divided into 3 groups.
1728,One group of children received tiotropium at a dose of 2.5 g per day.
1729,Another group received tiotropium at a dose of 5 g per day.
1730,The third group of children received placebo.
1731,Every child in the study had an equal chance of being in any of the 3 groups.
1732,The children and their parents did not know which treatment the child was taking.
1734,The children took tiotropium or placebo for 48 weeks.
1735,They also continued with their usual asthma medicine.
1736,Researchers wanted to know if children who took tiotropium had improved lung function after 24 weeks.
1737,"To look at lung function, the researchers measured how much air the children could blow out of their lungs in 1 second after taking a deep breath."
1738,They compared the children who took tiotropium to the children who took placebo.
1739,The children visited the doctors regularly.
1740,"During these visits, the doctors collected information about the child s health."

1742,The results of the study showed that taking tiotropium improved the lung function of the children.
1743,The children who took tiotropium could blow out more air after 24 weeks than they could before they started to take tiotropium.
1744,This improvement in lung function was larger for children who took tiotropium than for children who took placebo.
1745,The results of the study are shown in the picture below.
1747,"Yes, children in the placebo group had unwanted effects."
1749,"In this study, 2 out of the 401 children who took part had unwanted effects."

1814,Patients were divided into 2 groups of similar size to receive either BI 695501 or Humira .
1816,The patients did not know which treatment they were given.
1818,Patients were given 80 mg of either BI 695501 or Humira during the first visit.
1819,Then they received 40 mg of that same treatment one week later.
1820,"After that, they received 40 mg of that same treatment every 2 weeks."
1823,Researchers wanted to know if the percentage of patients who improved after BI 695501 treatment was the same as after Humira treatment.
1824,The doctors used a measurement called the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI).
1825,"For this measurement, the doctors looked at the size and overall condition of each patient s skin plaques after 16 weeks."
1826,Patients withat least a 50% improvement in the PASI after 16 weeks could continue treatment for another 8 weeks.
1827,13 September 2018 BI 1297.12 Page 3 of 5What were the results of this study?
1828,Researchers found that BI 695501 and Humira were similar.

1936,It includes information about howresearchers did the study and what the results were.
1937,The simplified title for the study is: A study in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia to find the highest dose of volasertib that patients could bear when given with decitabine .
1939,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about volasertib and the treatment of cancer."
1941,Older patients (aged 65 years or older) with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) took part in this study.
1942,Researchers wanted to find the highest dose of volasertib that patients could take when given with decitabine without having certain side effects.
1943,"To achieve this, theycollected information on the side effects of volasertib when taken with decitabine."
1944,This study started in February 2014 and finished in May 2016.
1945,This study was stopped early because the sponsor decided not to further develop volasertib.
1946,The sponsor of this study was Boehringer Ingelheim.
1948,"AML is a fast-growing cancer in the blood and the bone marrow, which is the spongy part of bone where blood cells are made."
1949,It causes abnormal blood cells to build up so the body can no longer fight infections or stop bleeding.
1950,"AML is diagnosed most often in patients older than 65 years of age, and very few of these patients survive 5 years after the diagnosis."
1951,Young adult patients have treatment options like intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.
1952,These therapies have been used to successfully treat AML in young patients.
1953,"However, older patients are often more difficult to treat because they are not as strong and can have additional health issues."
1954,"Also, the available therapies for older patients are not as likely to cure AML."
1956,"Every patient in the study took 2 medicines: Volasertib (also called BI 6727) is a new medicine, which is given by infusion into a vein."
1957,It works by blocking the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread throughout the body.
1958,Decitabine is a medicine that is routinely used to treat older patients with AML.
1959,It is also given by infusion into a vein and works by blocking the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
1960,"In the previous studies, it seemed to help older patients with AML to reduce their disease."
1961,BI 1230.30Abbreviated Report30 Jan 2018 Page 2 of 5Who participated in the study?
1962,Patients with AML who were 65 years old or older participated in this study.
1963,Most patients(10 out of 13) had received other chemotherapy in the past for AML.
1964,They had no other serious health problem that would preclude their treatment with decitabine.
1965,"However, most patients did have some health problems due to their age and due to certain medicines that they had already received."
1966,The study planned for at least 127 patients in the United States to take part.
1967,"However,because the study was stopped early, only 13 patients took part."
1968,There were 7 men and 6 women who took the study medicines.
1969,The average age was 73 years.
1970,The youngest patient was 66 years old and the oldest patient was 84 years old.
1972,All patients took volasertib in combination with decitabine on a regular schedule.
1973,Researchers wanted to know the highest dose of volasertib with decitabine that patients could tolerate.
1974,"To find this dose, doctors gave increasing doses of volasertib to different small groups of patients."
1975,The first group of patients to enter the study started taking 300 milligrams (mg) of volasertib.
1976,"The next group of patients was given 350 mg, and the next group was given 400 mg."
1977,The study doctors checked each group for certain severe side effects.
1978,They determined the dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients had such side effects.
1979,This dose was the maximum tolerated dose.
1980,"It was determined in the first treatment cycle, which took 4 weeks in this study."
1981,There were 4 parts of the study planned.
1982,Each part was to test a different schedule of the volasertib and decitabine combination.
1983,"However, since the study was stopped early, patients only participated in the first part (Schedule A)."
1984,A patient was treated in several treatment cycles as long as the conditions to stop treatment were not reached.
1985,Each treatment cycle also included a period of rest.
1986,Both the study doctor and the patients knew what dose of study medicines the patients were getting.
1987,"The dose of decitabine was based on the patient s body size (20 mg per square metre of body surface area, or m2)."
1988,Decitabine was given for the first 5 days of every treatment cycle.
1989,Volasertib was given on the first day and then on the 15th day of every treatment cycle.
1990,"Patients were to receive the study medicines until their cancer symptoms got worse, or until the patients had side effects they could not tolerate."
1991,BI 1230.30Abbreviated Report30 Jan 2018 Page 3 of 5All patients followed the same general procedures repeated for each 4-week treatment cycle: Patients visited the study doctor regularly each week.
1992,"At these visits, blood was collected for safety tests, and patients answered questions about their health."
1993,Heart rhythm was measured at the visits when the patient received an infusion of either of the study medicines.
1994,"At some visits, the cells in bone marrow were checked for disease."
1995,"At all visits, the doctors collected information on side effects."
1996,The doctors looked after each patient and checked their results.
1997,The doctors did more medical tests when needed.
1999,It was determined that 400 mg of volasertib was the maximum tolerated dose when taken with 20 mg/m2 of decitabine.
2000,This was the highest planned dose for the study.
2001,"Because the study was stopped early, results were available for only 1 out of 4 planned parts of the study."
2002,What side effects did patients have?

2046,"By taking part in this study, you helped researchers answer important questions about the combination of tiotropium and olodaterol and the treatment of COPD."
2048,COPD is a disease that makes it difficult to breathe.
2049,Patients with COPD have an increased risk of having cardiovascular diseases.
2050,Researchers compared 2 different treatments for COPD.
2051,They contrasted how the 2 treatments helped heart function in patients with COPD.
2053,The combination of the medicines tiotropium and olodaterol is used to treat COPD.
2054,But it is not known whether taking these medicines improves heart function.
2055,This study was needed to find how these medicines affect the heart.
2057,Tiotropium and olodaterol are 2 different medicines.
2058,They are used to treat COPD.
2059,Tiotropium and olodaterol both help to open the airways.
2060,Taking both medicines together opens the airways more than taking either medicine alone.
2061,The combination of tiotropium and olodaterol (tiotropium+olodaterol) comes as a solution that needs to be inhaled.
2062,Patients take the medicine with a special inhaler called the Respimat .
2063,Fluticasone and salmeterol are 2 different medicines that are also used to treat COPD.
2064,The combination of fluticasone and salmeterol (fluticasone+salmeterol) works to open the airways but in a different way from tiotropium+olodaterol.
2065,Fluticasone+salmeterol comes as a dry powder that needs to be inhaled.
2066,Patients take the medicine with a special inhaler called the Accuhaler .
2067,15 January 2019 BI 1237.36 Page 2 of 4Who took part in this study?
2068,The study included patients with COPD.
2069,The patients had no signs of cardiovascular disease.
2070,Patients could take part in the study if they had a history of smoking or were current smokers.
2071,"Overall, 76 patients took part in the study."
2072,This included 45 men and 31 women.
2073,The average age was 62 years.
2074,The youngest patient was 48 years old.
2075,The oldest patient was 74 years old.
2076,All patients were from Germany.
2078,Patients took both types of treatment (tiotropium+olodaterol and fluticasone+salmeterol)for 6 weeks each.
2079,The patients were divided into 2 groups by chance.
2080,The patients did not know which treatment they were taking first or second.
2082,One group of patients started by taking tiotropium+olodaterol from the Respimat inhaler and placebo from the Accuhaler inhaler for 6 weeks.
2083,Then they switched to take fluticasone+salmeterol from the Accuhaler inhaler and placebo from the Respimat inhaler for 6 weeks.
2084,The placebo in each inhaler was an inactive substance that looked like the medicines.
2085,The other group of patients started by taking fluticasone+salmeterol from the Accuhaler inhaler and placebo from the Respimat inhaler for 6 weeks.
2086,Then they switched to take tiotropium+olodaterol from the Respimat inhaler and placebo from the Accuhaler inhaler for 6 weeks.
2087,This is shown in the picture below.
2088,"During treatment, all patients inhaled 2 puffs from the Respimat inhaler and then 1 puff from the Accuhaler inhaler each morning."
2089,They also inhaled 1 puff from the Accuhaler each evening.
2090,"Each patient s Respimat inhaler had 5 g (micrograms) tiotropium and 5 golodaterol, or placebo."
2091,"Each patient s Accuhaler inhaler had 500 g fluticasone propionate and 50 g salmeterol, or placebo."

2093,They did this by looking at special images of the patients' hearts.
2094,The images are called magnetic resonance images.
2095,"With these images, the researchers can find out how well the heart pumps."
2096,A measurement called LVEDVI tells the researchers how much blood the heart can pump out.
2100,Researchers found that both treatments improved the function of the heart.
2101,"When patients took tiotropium+olodaterol, LVEDVI increased by an average 2.317 mL (millilitres) per square meter of body surface area."
2102,"When patients took fluticasone+salmeterol, LVEDVI increased by an average 2.855 mL per square meter of body surface area."
2103,The difference between the two treatments was not meaningful.
2106,"In this study, no patients had unwanted effects while taking tiotropium+olodaterol."
2107,4 out of 70 patients (6%) had unwanted effects while taking fluticasone+salmeterol.
2108,"These unwanted effects were yeast infection of the mouth and throat (oral candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis), voice problems (dysphonia), and dry mouth."
2111,"If researchers do additional clinical studies with tiotropium and olodaterol, you will find them on the websites listed in the next section."

2146,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about BI 1026706 and the treatment of DME."
2148,Researchers wanted to find out whether a medicine called BI 1026706 helps patients withDME.
2149,Macular edema occurs when fluid builds up in a part of the eye called the macula.
2150,The excess fluid causes the macula to swell.
2151,Swelling of the macula leads to loss of vision.
2152,DME is a complication of type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
2153,This study started in June 2016 and finished in October 2017.
2155,New treatments for DME are needed.
2156,Some treatments are already available for DME.
2157,These treatments are given as injections directly into the eye.
2158,Injections into the eye are uncomfortable and might cause complications.
2159,Researchers want to develop new treatments for DME that can be given without injections.
2160,This study was done to test a new medicine called BI 1026706.
2161,"This medicine can be taken as a tablet by mouth, and no injections are needed."
2163,BI 1026706 is a new medicine that is being tested for treating DME.
2164,It is taken as a tablet by mouth.
2165,Placebo tablets looked like BI 1026706 but did not contain any medicine.
2166,Researchers compared BI 1026706 with placebo to find out how well BI 1026706 works.
2167,BI 1320.2219 Jul 2018 Page 2 of 4Who participated in the study?
2168,Patients could take part in this study if they had DME with mild vision loss.

2177,One group of patients received BI 1026706 and the other group received placebo for 12 weeks.
2178,Every patient had an equal chance of being in the BI 1026706 group or in the placebo group.
2181,Patients in the BI 1026706 group took a tablet of 100 milligrams BI 1026706 twice a day.
2182,Patients in the placebo group took a placebo tablet twice a day.
2183,Researchers wanted to know if BI 1026706 could help to reduce swelling in the macula.
2184,"To measure the amount of swelling, study doctors measured the thickness of the macula."
2185,They did this by taking special pictures of each patient s macula.
2186,Researchers measured thethickness of each patient s macula at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study.
2188,"During the visits, the doctors also collected information on each patient s health."
2190,BI 1026706 and placebo did not have any meaningful effect on the thickness of the macula.
2191,"In other words, BI 1026706 did not reduce swelling in the macula of patients with DME."
2192,BI 1320.2219 Jul 2018 Page 3 of 4Were there any unwanted effects?
2194,"In this study, 7 out of 52 patients (14%) in the BI 1026706 group and 7 out of 53 patients (13%) in the placebo group had unwanted effects."
2195,Each unwanted effect was reported for no more than 1 patient in either treatment group.
2196,Some unwanted effects were serious because they required a visit to the hospital or a longer stay in the hospital.
2197,"In this study, there was 1 patient in the BI 1026706 group who had serious unwanted effects."

2404,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of IPF."
2406,This study looked at the long-term safety of a medicine called nintedanib in patients with IPF.
2407,IPF is a rare disease that causes scarring of the tissue inside the lungs.
2408,The scarring makes the lungs become thick and stiff (fibrotic).
2410,The word 'idiopathic' means that doctors do not know the cause of the disease.
2411,The patients in this study had already participated in previous nintedanib studies.
2412,This study started in July 2012.
2413,Some patients are still in the study.
2414,The final analysis shown in this summary was done in September 2017.
2416,This study allowed patients from previous nintedanib studies to receive nintedanib for a longer period of time.
2417,Researchers wanted to see the long-term safety of nintedanib in patients with IPF.
2419,Researchers studied the medicine nintedanib (also known as BIBF 1120).
2420,Nintedanib is a medicine that is used to treat IPF.
2421,Nintedanib can help to slow down the worsening of the disease.
2422,Researchers think that nintedanib blocks biological signals that take place in the lung-scarring process.
2423,Nintedanib is given as a capsule taken by mouth.

2433,"In this study, patients with IPF received long-term nintedanib treatment."
2434,Most patients started treatment on a dose of 150 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
2435,"If patients had side effects that they could not tolerate, the doctors could lower the dose to 100 mg twice a day."
2436,Patients could also stop taking nintedanib for a while.
2437,The patients and their doctors knew which dose of nintedanib the patients were taking.
2438,"On average, patients took nintedanib for 2 years and 7 months."
2439,The longest time a patient took nintedanib in this study was 4 years and 8 months.
2440,"Overall, 36% of patients had at least 1 dose reduction and 38% had at least 1 treatment interruption."
2442,"During the visits, the doctors collected information about health problems the patients had during the study."
2443,"In this way, researchers could determine the long-term safety of nintedanib."

2447,"In this long-term study, 723 out of 734 patients (99%) had health problems."
2448,Some patients had to stop taking nintedanib because of health problems.
2449,"Overall, 313 patients (43%) stopped treatment because of health problems."
2450,"Some health problems were serious because they required a visit to hospital or a longer stay in hospital, were life-threatening, or fatal."
2451,Health problems were also serious if they led to disability or the doctor thought they were serious for any other reason.
2452,"In this study, 506patients (69%) had serious health problems."
2453,This included 175 patients (24%) who died from serious health problems.
2454,The health problems were similar to those seen in previous studies of nintedanib in patients with IPF.
2455,The most common health problems were with the stomach and bowel.
2456,Researchers found no new safety concerns in this study.
2458,Unwanted effects are any health problems that the doctors thought were caused by nintedanib.

2516,Adult patients with different types of cancer that was advanced or had spread could takepart in this study.
2517,The patients had to have already taken cancer treatment that was not able to help slow the growth of their cancer.
2518,A total of 90 patients were treated.
2519,"More patients were planned for the study, but the study was stopped early."
2520,42 patients were men and 48 patients were women.
2522,The youngest patient was 20 years old.
2523,The oldest patient was 79 years old.
2524,Half of the patients were in Belgium and half were in Italy.
2526,The patients in this study took BI 860585 alone or BI 860585 with another treatment.
2527,The treatment each patient took depended on when they started the study and which treatmentthe doctors thought was best for treating their cancer.
2528,41 patients took BI 860585 once a day.
2529,25 patients took BI 860585 once a day and exemestane 25 mg once a day.
2530,24 patients took BI 860585 once a day.
2531,They were also given paclitaxel once a week at the standard approved dose of 60 mg or 80 mg per square metre of body surface area.
2532,Researchers wanted to find the highest dose of BI 860585 that patients could tolerate alone or together with exemestane or paclitaxel during their first cycle of treatment.
2534,One cycle of treatment was 28 days.
2535,"To find the maximum tolerated dose, researchers looked at how many patients had certain sever health problems that might have been caused by treatment."
2537,The patients and their doctors knew which treatment and the dose of BI 860585 they were taking.
2538,"As long as a patient did not have a health problem they could not tolerate, they could take their study medicine for as long as their cancer did not grow."

2586,It includes information about how researchers did the study and what happened during the study.
2587,We thank the patients who took part in this study.
2589,Some medicines may affect the amount of hormonal birth control medicine in the blood.
2590,This can make the birth control medicine (the pill) less effective.
2591,Researchers wanted to find out whether a drug called nintedanib influences the amount of birth control medicine in the blood.
2592,This study started in June 2016 and finished in November 2017.
2593,This study was stopped early because fewer patients entered the study than were planned.
2595,Nintedanib is a medicine that is approved in some countries to treat a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
2596,Nintedanib is also approved in more than 60 countries to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
2597,Women who could get pregnant must usehighly effective methods of birth control while taking nintedanib.
2598,This is because nintedanib could harm an unborn baby.
2599,Researchers wanted to find out if nintedanib had any influence on how much of the birth control medicine was in patients' blood.
2600,They planned to use the results from this study to advise patients about the type of birth control to use.
2604,It is used to treat a certaintype of lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel).
2606,05 September 2018 BI 1199.238 Page 2 of 3Ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel are components of a commonly used birth control medicine.
2607,This birth control medicine is taken as a tablet by mouth.
2609,The study included women with NSCLC who were planning to start treatment with nintedanib.
2610,"Overall, 2 patients took part in the study, out of 24 patients planned."
2611,The average age was 67.
2612,Both patients were from Germany.
2614,Both patients received birth control medicine and nintedanib.
2615,The patients and their doctors knew which treatment they were given.
2616,"On the first test day, patients took a tablet of the birth control medicine (30 micrograms of ethinylestradiol plus 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel)."
2617,Blood samples were collected.
2618,"Before the second test day, patients had taken 2 tablets of nintedanib (200 milligrams) each day for at least a week."
2619,"On the second test day, patients took another tablet of birth control medicine together with nintedanib."
2621,Researchers checked how much birth control medicine was in patients' blood on test days 1 and 2.
2625,The study was stopped early.
2626,There were not enough patients to reach clear conclusions about the results of the study.
2629,"In this study, 1 out of 2 patients had an unwanted effect of diarrhoea."
2630,1 out of 2 patients had an unwanted effect of pain in arms or legs (extremities).
2631,05 September 2018 BI 1199.238 Page 3 of 3Are there follow-up studies?

2655,Lay summary 1275.19BI 1275.1926 Jan 2018 Page 1 of 6This is a summary of a clinical study in type 2 diabetes.
2658,The simplified title for the study is: Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin combined with linagliptin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes .
2660,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about empagliflozin combined with linagliptin forthe treatment of type 2 diabetes."
2662,This study tested an empagliflozin/linagliptin combination to treat Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
2663,Researchers wanted to know how well the combination worked compared with linagliptin alone when taken for 24 weeks by these patients.
2664,The combination was given as a single tablet.
2665,"During the study, researchers also collected information on side effects ofthe study medicines during 52 weeks of treatment."
2666,This study started in May 2015 and finished in March 2017.
2669,Patients may be able to control their blood sugar levels by following a diet and exercise plan.
2670,"Sometimes, medicine may be needed as well."
2671,There is a need to develop medicines that allow patients to control their blood sugar levels over long periods of time with fewer side effects.
2672,Linagliptin is often used to control blood sugar levels.
2673,"When linagliptin alone does not control the blood sugar levels, additional medicines may be needed."
2674,"In this study, researchers tested a tablet containing linagliptin and empagliflozin."
2675,Combining multiple medicines in 1 tablet reduces the number of tablets that patients have to take.
2677,"In this study, the researchers tested a combination of 2 medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes: Empagliflozin: Empagliflozin helps the kidney to remove sugar from the blood."
2678,The sugar is removed in the urine.
2679,Empagliflozin belongs to a class of medicines called SGLT-2 inhibitors.
2680,Linagliptin: Linagliptin helps the body to produce more insulin.
2681,More insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the blood.
2682,Linagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors.
2683,BI 1275.1926 Jan 2018 Page 2 of 6Who participated in the study?
2684,Patients in this study had type 2 diabetes.
2685,"They had followed a diet and exercise plan, but still had high blood sugar."
2686,"Some patients had not been treated for their diabetes, and others had taken 1 oral antidiabetic medicine."
2687,A total of 275 patients took part in the comparison of the combination treatment with the linagliptin treatment: 214 men (78%) and 61 women (22%).
2689,The youngest patient was 32 years old and the oldest patient was 82 years old.
2690,The study was done in Japan.
2692,"At the beginning of the study, patients took 5 milligrams (mg) of linagliptin daily for 16 weeks."
2693,"After this, the patients who still had high blood sugar continued the study."
2694,"They participated in the Main Phase of the study, followed by the Extension Phase."
2695,Main Phase (24 weeks)The patients were divided into 2 treatment groups: Two thirds of the patients took a tablet containing 10 mg of empagliflozin and 5 mg of linagliptin.
2696,The remaining one third of the patients took only 5 mg of linagliptin.
2697,It was decided by chance which patient got into which group.
2698,Neither the patients nor the study doctors knew which study medicines the patients took.
2699,The patients took their medicines each day for 24 weeks.
2700,"Extension Phase (28 weeks)After the Main Phase, patients continued in the same treatment groups for an additional28 weeks."
2701,"If patients still had high blood sugar after treatment with the combination in the Main Phase, they received a higher dose in the Extension Phase (a tablet containing 25 mg of empagliflozin and 5 mg of linagliptin)."
2702,The Extension Phase allowed researchers to learn about the long-term effects of the medicines.
2703,The researchers wanted to know how the medicines affected the amount of sugar in the blood.
2704,"To do this, they measured the amount of a protein called glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood."
2705,Patients whose blood sugar is not well controlled have high HbA1c levels.
2706,The researchers compared the patients HbA1c levels at the beginning of the Main Phase with their levels after 24 weeks of treatment.
2707,"In addition, they collected information on the side effects of the study medicines."
2708,BI 1275.1926 Jan 2018 Page 3 of 6What were the results of this study?
2710,Was there a greater reduction in HbA1c levels in patients who took the combination?
2712,"After 24 weeks of treatment, there was a greater reduction in HbA1c levels in patients who took the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination than in patients who took linagliptin alone."
2714,They found that the difference in results between the treatment groups was not likely due to chance.
2715,The picture below shows the average change in the HbA1c level from the beginning of the Main Phase to after 24 weeks of treatment for each group.
2716,The HbA1c level decreased by 0.93% in patients who took the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination over 24 weeks.

2863,Lay summary 1200.3827 JULY 2018 BI 1200.38 Page 1 of 5Exploring the Safety of Combining Afatinib with Standard Treatments for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)This is a summary of a clinical study in brain cancer.
2867,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about afatinib and the treatment of brain cancer."
2869,"This study looked at the safety, effectiveness, and maximum tolerated dose of a medicine called afatinib."
2870,It was combined with the standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme(GBM).
2871,GBM is a form of brain cancer that is difficult to treat.
2872,Standard treatment for GBM usually includes surgery followed by radiotherapy.
2873,Most patients also take a medicine called temozolomide while doing radiotherapy.
2874,Researchers wanted to know the best dose of afatinib to combine with treatments for patients with GBM.
2875,Researchers also wanted to study health problems the patients hadduring treatment.
2876,This study started in November 2009 and finished in September 2017.
2878,Treatment options for patients with GBM are limited.
2880,Not all patients benefit from taking temozolomide.
2881,"Previous studies have shown that afatinib is effective in treating some forms of cancer (for example, lung cancer)."
2882,"Afatinib can slow the growth and spread of tumours, either by itself or combined with other treatments."
2884,Afatinib (also known as BIBW 2992) is a medicine that helps to stop cancer from growing and spreading.
2885,Afatinib permanently blocks several growth factor signals.
2886,One of these is a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
2887,Afatinib is taken as a tablet by mouth.
2888,27 JULY 2018 BI 1200.38 Page 2 of 5A combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide is the standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM.
2889,Temozolomide is a medicine that helps to stop cancer from growing and spreading.
2890,It is given as a capsule by mouth.
2891,Radiotherapy is treatment with x-rays or other high-energy rays to control or kill cancer cells.
2893,Adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM took part in this study.
2894,Most patients had surgery prior to the trial.
2895,None of the patients had been treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy before starting the study.
2896,A total of 36 patients were treated in the study.
2897,This included 25 men and 11 women.
2898,The average age was 53 years.
2899,The youngest patient was 25 years old.
2900,The oldest patient was 68 years old.
2901,All patients were from the United Kingdom.
2904,The patients were divided based on the results of genetic tests of their tumours.
2905,One group of patients received afatinib plus radiotherapy and temozolomide.
2906,This was Regimen M. The type of tumour they had showed a benefit from receiving temozolomide in previous studies.
2907,The other group received afatinib plus radiotherapy only.
2908,This was Regimen U.
2909,The type of tumour they had did not show a benefit from receiving temozolomide in previous studies.
2911,"In Part 1 of the study, researchers studied dosing."
2912,They wanted to know the highest dose of afatinib that patients assigned to Regimen M or U could tolerate.
2913,They wanted to know how much afatinib to give to patients on radiotherapy.
2914,"To find this dose, doctors gave increasing doses of afatinib to small groups of patients."
2915,They checked each patient for certain severe health problems that the doctors thought were caused by afatinib.
2916,They determined the dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients hadsuch health problems.
2918,There were 3 different doses of afatinib being considered in Part 1 of this study.
2919,"The doses were 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg. Each patient was assigned to one of these doses."
2920,Both the study doctor and the patients knew what dose the patients were getting.
2921,Patients were treated for 6 weeks.
2922,Afatinib was taken daily.
2923,Temozolomide (75 mg per square metre of body surface area) was taken daily by patients assigned to Regimen M. The radiotherapy (total dose 60 Gy) was given 5 days a week to all patients.
2924,"27 JULY 2018 BI 1200.38 Page 3 of 5After 6 weeks, patients entered Part 2 of the study."
2925,"In this part, the patients no longer received radiotherapy."
2926,All patients took afatinib daily at a dose of 40 mg.
2927,The patients assigned to Regimen M stopped taking temozolomide for 4 weeks.
2928,"After that, patients took temozolomide for 6 (28-day) cycles."
2929,"In each cycle, patients took temozolomidefor 5 days followed by 23 days off."
2930,"For Cycle 1, the dose was 150 mg per square metre body surface area."
2931,"For Cycles 2 6, the dose was 200 mg per square metre body surface area if tolerated."
2932,"Patients could receive the study medicines until their cancer symptoms got worse, or until patients had a side effect they could not tolerate."
2934,"During the visits, the doctors collected information about each patient s health."
2936,"For patients who received afatinib plus radiotherapy and temozolomide (Regimen M), the maximum tolerated dose was 30 mg of afatinib."
2937,"For patients who received afatinib plus radiotherapy (Regimen U), the maximum tolerated dose was 40 mg of afatinib."
2938,This study also examined all health problems patients had during the study.
2939,"Health problems included those caused by GBM, other diseases, radiotherapy, and study or other medicines."
2940,Unwanted effects of afatinib are described in a separate section below.
2941,All 20 patients in Regimen M had health problems.
2942,"Of these patients, 9 (45%) had to stop taking afatinib because of health problems."
2943,"Also, 3 patients (15%) had to stop taking temozolomide because of health problems."
2944,All 16 patients in Regimen U had health problems.
2945,"Of these patients, 10 (63%) had to stop taking afatinib because of health problems."
2946,Health problems were serious for many reasons.
2947,Serious health problems included complications that required a visit to or longer stay in hospital.
2948,"Serious health problems could also be life-threatening, fatal, or lead to disability."
2949,"In addition, doctors could list health problems as serious for any other reason."
2950,"For Regimen M, 12 patients (60%) had serious health problems."
2951,"For Regimen U, 12 patients (75%) had serious health problems."
2952,"In Regimen U, 3 patients (19%) died."
2953,None of these deaths were related to treatment.
2954,27 JULY 2018 BI 1200.38 Page 4 of 5Were there any unwanted effects?
2956,"For Regimen M, 19 out of 20 patients (95%) had unwanted effects."
2957,"For Regimen U, 15 out of 16 patients (94%) had unwanted effects."

2962,"For Regimen M, 6 patients (30%) had serious unwanted effects."
2963,"For Regimen U, 1 patient (6%) had serious unwanted effects."
2965,No follow-up studies are currently planned.
2966,"If more clinical studies with afatinib are done, they may be found on the public websites listed in the section below."

2992,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about tiotropium and olodaterol and the treatment of COPD."
2994,This study compared 4 treatments for COPD.
2995,"One treatment involved inhaling 2 medicines (tiotropium and olodaterol), starting to exercise, and making lifestyle changes."
2996,A second treatment involved inhaling 2 medicines (tiotropium and olodaterol) and making lifestyle changes.
2997,The third treatment involved inhaling 1 medicine only (tiotropium) and making lifestyle changes.
2998,The fourth treatment involved making lifestyle changes only.
2999,Researchers measured the physical fitness (in terms of exercise capacity) of patients who took treatments including medicines.
3000,They also measured the physical fitness of patients who took the treatment including lifestyle changes only.
3001,"At the end of the study, the treatments including medicines were compared with the treatment including lifestyle changes only."
3002,This study started in March 2014 and ended in October 2015.
3005,"It causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness."
3006,Patients often have a cough that produces mucus.
3007,COPD is usually caused by smoking cigarettes.
3008,04 Sep 2018 BI 1237.16 Page 2 of 6Many people with COPD find it hard to stay physically active.
3009,Physical activity makes them feel out of breath.
3010,"However, it is important for patients with COPD to stay active and exercise."
3011,"Otherwise, their symptoms might get worse."
3012,Researchers wanted to find out what treatments help patients increase physical fitness.
3014,Researchers studied 2 medicines that widen the airways.
3015,Tiotropium is used to treat COPD.
3016,Olodaterol is also used to treat COPD.
3017,Both medicines help to open the airways and keep them open all day long (long-acting bronchodilators).
3018,This makes it easier for patients to breathe.
3019,Both medicines are used separately or combined together (a fixed-dose combination) for the treatment of COPD.
3020,These medicines come as a solution that needs to be inhaled using a special inhaler called the Respimat .
3021,This inhaler converts the solution into a soft mist.
3022,Patients breathe in this soft mist to take the medicines.
3023,Placebo inhalers looked like the other inhalers tested but did not contain any medicine.
3025,Patients with COPD took part in the study.
3026,All had to be current or ex-smokers between the ages of 40 and 75 years.
3027,Overall 303 patients were treated; 200 were men and 103 were women.
3028,On average patients were 65 years old.
3030,The oldest patient was 75 years old.

3033,Patients were divided into 4 groups.
3034,Each patient had an equal chance of being in a certain group.
3035,The patients in each group received a different treatment or combination of treatments as follows:Combination 1: Patients took 2 puffs of combined tiotropium and olodaterol every day (5 g tiotropium/5 g olodaterol per day).
3036,They used the Respimat inhaler to take their medicine.
3037,Patients were encouraged to make lifestyle changes.
3038,They also took exercise classes.
3039,Combination 2: Patients took 2 puffs of combined tiotropium and olodaterol every day (5 g tiotropium/5 g olodaterol per day).
3041,Patients were also encouraged to make lifestyle changes.
3042,Tiotropium: Patients took 2 puffs of tiotropium every day (5 g tiotropium per day).
3045,Placebo: Patients took 2 puffs of placebo every day.
3046,They used the Respimat inhaler to take placebo.
3048,The chart below provides a summary of the different treatments and their components.
3049,Combination 1 Combination 2 Tiotropium PlaceboTiotropium + Olodaterol(12 weeks) Tiotropium only (12 weeks) Lifestyle changes (12 weeks) Exercise (3 times per week for 8 weeks) Patients in the group that received exercise training knew what treatment they received.
3050,This is because they were the only group that received exercise training.
3051,The patients in the other groups did not know which medicine they received.
3053,Patients visited their doctors regularly during the 12 weeks of the study.
3055,04 Sep 2018 BI 1237.16 Page 4 of 6Patients also took tests to find out how fit they were at doctor visits.
3056,One test was called the endurance shuttle walk test at 85% of predicted maximum oxygen consumption.
3057,"During this test, each patient walked a constant, brisk speed."
3058,This speed was directly related to the individual patient's maximum speed.
3059,"Even though some patients walked faster and others walked slower, all patients walked at the same relative speed."
3060,Researchers measured the time each patient could walk during this test before needing to stop due to symptoms.
3061,Researchers were particularly interested in the results of this test after 8 weeks of treatment.
3063,Patients who took combinations 1 or 2 were more physically fit than those who took placebo.
3064,They could walk for a longer time before needing to stop due to symptoms than patients who took placebo.
3065,Patients who took tiotropium were not more physically fit than those who took placebo.
3066,Patients in the tiotropium and placebo groups walked a similar time before needing to stop due to symptoms.
3067,"More specifically, patients who took combination 1 walked 46% longer than patients who took placebo."
3068,Patients who took combination 2 walked 29% longer than patients who took placebo.
3069,Researchers did statistical tests on these results.
3070,It is unlikely that the difference between the combination 1 and placebo groups came about by chance.
3071,It is also unlikely that the difference between the combination 2 and placebo groups came about by chance.
3072,Statistical tests showed that it was more likely than not that the difference between the tiotropium and placebo groups came about by chance.
3073,These results (Week 8) are illustrated in the graph below.
3074,04 Sep 2018 BI 1237.16 Page 5 of 6Were there any unwanted effects?
3076,A total of 2 out of 76 patients (2.6%) in the combination 1 group had unwanted effects.
3077,"In the combination 2 group, 3 out of 76 patients (3.9%) had unwanted effects."
3078,In the tiotropium group 6 out of 76 patients (7.9%) had unwanted effects.

3119,This study started in August 2010 and finished in August 2015.
3120,This summary includes the main results of the study based on information collected up to September 2013.
3121,The study was still ongoing at the time.
3122,The full results of the completed study will be provided in a later summary.
3123,The lay title for this study is Efficacy and Safety of Empagliflozin (BI 10773) with Metformin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes .
3124,What was the study about?
3125,This study compared 2 medicines to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.
3126,Researchers wanted to see how well the medicines worked when taken for a long period of time.
3127,"They also wanted to know what side effects there were, and how well patients tolerated the medicines."
3128,Patients in this study were already taking a common diabetes medicine called metformin.
3129,Metformin alone did not control their diabetes well.
3130,"During this study, patients continued to take metformin."
3131,"They also took 1 of the study medicines for 2 years: either a medicine called empagliflozin, or a medicine called glimepiride."
3132,Some patients continued to take study medicine for up to 2 additional years in an extension period of the study.
3133,Why was the research needed?
3134,Patients with type 2 diabetes have too much sugar (glucose) in their blood.
3135,This can increase the risk of medical problems such as heart or kidney disease.
3136,"Therefore, controlling blood sugar is important for patients with type 2 diabetes."
3137,Patients may be able to control their blood sugar by following a diet and exercise plan.
3139,Metformin is often the first medicine used.
3140,"If metformin alone does not control the blood sugar, additional medicines may be needed."
3141,There is a need to develop medicines that allow patients to control their blood sugar over long periods of time with fewer side effects.
3142,"This study tested whether taking empagliflozin or glimepiride, in addition to metformin, improved control of blood sugar."

3144,The researchers compared 2 medicines that lower blood sugar.
3145,These were: Empagliflozin: a new medicine to treat type 2 diabetes.
3146,It works by blocking a protein called SGLT-2 in the kidneys.
3147,Empagliflozin helps the kidneys filter sugar out of the blood and into urine (pee).
3148,Urinating (peeing) more sugar out of the body lowers blood sugar.
3149,Glimepiride: a medicine that has been used for many years to treat type 2 diabetes.
3150,It works by helping the body to make more insulin.
3151,More insulin in the blood lowers the amount of sugar in the blood.
3152,What did the researchers want to know?
3153,The researchers compared empagliflozin to glimepiride.
3154,They measured the amount of a protein called glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood.
3155,Doctors measure HbA1c levels to see how controlled the blood sugar of a patient has been over the past 3 months.
3156,"The lower the HbA1c level, the better the blood sugar is controlled."
3157,The researchers measured the amount of HbA1c in the patients blood at the beginning of the study.
3158,Researchers also measured the HbA1c level during the 2 years of treatment.
3159,The researchers wanted to know how much the HbA1c level in patients blood changed after 2 years of treatment with each study medicine.
3160,"In addition, researchers collected information on the side effects of both medicines."
3163,"They had taken metformin and followed a diet and exercise plan, but still had high blood sugar."
3164,Patients were at least 18 years old.
3165,The average age (mean) was 55.9 years old.
3166,The youngest patient was 23 years old and the oldest was 83 years old.
3167,"Patients could be in the study if they had: Taken only metformin and no other medications for their diabetes for at least the last 3 months An HbA1c level from 7.0% to 10.0% at the start of the study Followed a diet and an exercise planOverall, 1545 patients were treated; 853 were men and 692 were women."

3170,"Empagliflozin comes in a tablet, and glimepiride comes in a capsule."
3171,The study results could be affected if the patient or the study doctor knew which medicine the patient wastaking.
3172,"To prevent this, patients took 1 of the medicines and a placebo each day."
3173,"The placebo in this study was a tablet or capsule that looked like the other medicines, but contained no active medicine."
3174,Neither the patients in the groups nor the study doctors knew which medicines the patients got.
3175,This is called a double-blind design .
3176,Patients were divided into 2 groups of similar size.
3177,It was decided by chance who got into which group (randomised).
3178,The patients in each group took the following medicines each day: Empagliflozin group: 1 tablet of 25 mg empagliflozin and 1 placebo capsuleGlimepiride group: 1 capsule of glimepiride (1 to 4 mg) and 1 placebo tabletAll patients took metformin every day while they were in the study.
3179,Patients could take study medicine for up to 2 years.
3180,Some patients continued to take study medicine for another 2 years (the extension period).
3181,This summary presents the main results found after the first 2 years of treatment.
3182,"Except for taking the different medicines, all patients followed the same procedures: Patients went to the study doctor every 4 to 13 weeks."
3183,Doctors took blood samples at specific visits.
3184,Doctors collected information on side effects.
3185,Patients answered questions about their health at specific visits.

3187,They also discussed any health problems with the patients and performed further medical tests when needed.
3188,The study design is shown in the figure below.
3190,The researchers compared the HbA1c levels of patients who had been treated for 2 years with empagliflozin or glimepiride with the levels at the beginning of the study.
3192,"To be sure that the results were reliable, researchers tested whether the results could have come about by chance."
3193,This was done by using statistical tests.
3194,Some of these statistical tests involved the calculation of so-called p-values.
3195,A small p-value (smaller than 0.05) shows that the results are unlikely due to chance.
3196,Larger p-values show that the results are possibly due to chance.
3197,Was empagliflozin as good as glimepiride in lowering HbA1c?

3200,HbA1c changed by -0.66% in patients who took empagliflozin.
3201,HbA1c changed by -0.55% in patients who took glimepiride.
3202,A statistical test was done to see if empagliflozin was at least as good as glimepiride in reducing HbA1c.
3203,The results of this test had a p-value of less than 0.0001.
3204,This value suggests that the study result was very unlikely due to chance.

3380,The simplified title for the study is: A study to test how effective and well tolerated a 12-week treatment of BI 409306 is in patients with schizophrenia .
3381,The results of this study may not apply to everybody.
3382,The study started in December 2014 and ended in June 2016.
3385,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about BI 409306."
3387,The researchers wanted to know how well 4 different doses of a new medicine called BI 409306 would improve the ability to think clearly and accurately in patients with schizophrenia.
3388,The study also looked at how well patients tolerated BI 409306.
3390,Schizophrenia is a brain disorder.
3391,Patients with schizophrenia may: Have strange thoughts and behaviours.
3392,Have problems thinking clearly and accurately.
3393,See or hear things that are not real.
3394,Medicines are available that may lessen some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.
3395,"However, there is a strong need for medicines that directly treat the causes of schizophrenia or the problems with thinking clearly and accurately."
3396,"Unclear thinking may affect attention, memory, learning, and managing daily tasks."
3397,This study looked at the effects of BI 409306 on patients ability to think clearly and accurately after they took BI 409306 in addition to their usual schizophrenia medicine for 12 weeks.

3399,The new medicine tested in the study is called BI 409306.
3400,It blocks the action of a protein called phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A).
3401,Blocking the action of PDE9A improves signalling in certain parts of the brain that are important for memory and learning.
3402,BI 409306 is being tested in patients with schizophrenia for its effects on the ability to think clearly and accurately.
3403,"In the study, researchers tested the effects of 4 different doses of BI 409306 tablets versus placebo tablets in patients with schizophrenia."
3404,"The placebo tablets looked exactly like BI 409306 tablets, but had no active medicine in them."
3406,Researchers wanted to know if taking BI 409306 helped patients with schizophrenia improve their ability to think clearly and accurately.
3407,Patients took a set of special tests called the MCCB several times during the study.
3408,The MCCB stands for Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery.
3409,"These tests measure processing speed, attention, learning, memory, problem solving, and social awareness."
3410,The result of the tests was a number value called the MCCB score.
3411,Changes in the MCCB score over time can show changes in the ability of patients with schizophrenia to think clearly and accurately.
3412,The researchers looked at the results of the tests after 12 weeks of taking study medicine (BI 409306 or placebo).
3413,Researchers also collected information on the side effects of BI 409306 and placebo during the study.
3415,The study treated a total of 516 patients with schizophrenia.
3416,All patients had stable symptoms (in the residual phase of their illness) for at least 8 weeks before the study began.
3417,Patients were already taking certain other medicines to treat schizophrenia symptoms.
3418,The average age was 42.3 years.
3419,The youngest patient was 19 years old and the oldest patient was 56 years old.

3421,"Patients were from North America (411 patients from Canada and the United States), Asia (82 patients from Japan, Malaysia, and Taiwan), and Europe (23 patients from Germany)."
3422,How was this study performed?
3423,Patients were divided into 5 groups.
3424,It was decided by chance who got into each group (randomised).
3425,The patients and the study doctors did not know who took which medicine.
3427,The patients in 4 of the groups took different doses of BI 409306.

3478,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about empagliflozin and the treatment of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
3480,This was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes who also had cardiovascular disease.
3481,Patients with type 2 diabetes have too much sugar in their blood.
3482,This can increase the risk of serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease.
3483,Cardiovascular disease is any disease that affects the heart or the blood vessels.
3484,"Common examples are heart attack, heart failure, and stroke."
3485,Researchers wanted to see if patients who also took empagliflozin were more likely or less likely to have serious cardiovascular problems.
3486,Researchers also collected information about any side effects the patients had during the study.
3487,This study started in August 2010 and finished in April 2015.
3491,"It is important to find out whethermedicines that are given to treat type 2 diabetes make cardiovascular disease more likely, or if they may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease."
3493,The researchers studied a medicine called empagliflozin (also known as BI 10773).
3494,Empagliflozin is a medicine that is used to treat type 2 diabetes.
3495,Empagliflozin helps the kidneys to remove sugar from the blood.
3498,Some patients were given empagliflozin tablets and some patients were given placebo tablets.
3499,"The placebo tablets looked like the empagliflozin tablets, but did not contain active medicine."

3514,"During the study, patients continued to receive their usual medicines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease if they had been taking them before the study started."
3515,"BI 1245.2507 Nov 2017 Page 3 of 5Except for taking the different medicines, all patients followed the same procedures: Patients went to the study doctor every 4 to 14 weeks."
3516,Doctors took blood samples at certain visits.
3517,Doctors collected information on side effects at every visit.
3518,"Patients had measurements of their heart rhythm taken at certain visits (electrocardiograms, or ECGs)."
3519,The doctors reviewed all medical test results at every visit.
3520,They discussed any health problems with the patients and performed further tests when needed.
3521,"The researchers wanted to know how many patients had a heart attack or a stroke, or died due to cardiovascular disease."
3522,Researchers call these events 3-MACE which means 3 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events.
3523,They combined the information from the 2 doses of empagliflozin to compare with placebo.
3525,"In the placebo group, 282 out of 2333 patients (12.1%) had a heart attack, a stroke, or died due to cardiovascular disease."
3526,"In the empagliflozin groups, 490 out of 4687 patients (10.5%) had a heart attack, a stroke, or died due to cardiovascular disease."
3527,"These results show that empagliflozin lowered the chance of having a heart attack, a stroke, or dying due to cardiovascular disease by 14%."
3528,"Researchers looked into more detail at each type of event that is included in 3-MACE: heart attacks, strokes, and death due to cardiovascular disease."
3529,The results showed that the main effect of empagliflozin was to lower the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.
3530,How does empagliflozin affect the chances of dying from cardiovascular disease?
3531,"In the placebo group, 137 out of 2333 patients (5.9%) died due to cardiovascular disease."
3532,"In the empagliflozin groups, 172 out of 4687 patients (3.7%) died due to cardiovascular disease."
3533,These results show that empagliflozin lowered the chance of dying from cardiovascular disease by 38%.
3534,Researchers also looked at how many patients died in the study from any cause.
3535,"In the placebo group, 194 out of 2333 patients (8.3%) died from any cause."
3536,"In the empagliflozin groups, 269 out of 4687 patients (5.7%) died from any cause."

3584,Lay summary 1160.186BI 1160.18614 Feb 2018 Page 1 of 7This is a summary of a clinical study in patients with a heart rhythm disorder.
3587,The simplified title for the study is: A comparison of the safety of dabigatran and warfarin when combined with other anti-blood-clotting medicines in patients with a heart rhythm disorder who had just undergone a specific procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention .
3589,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about dabigatran."
3591,"In this study, researchers compared the safety of 2 types of medicine combinations that help to prevent blood from clotting."
3592,One of the combinations included dabigatran and the other included warfarin.
3593,These medicine combinations were given to patients with a special heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation.
3594,Many patients with atrial fibrillation also have problems with their arteries becoming plugged and have a higher risk of stroke.
3595,The patients in this study had just undergone a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to open up an artery of the heart that was plugged.
3596,"During the procedure, a short wire mesh tube (a stent) is moved into the place in the artery where the plug was."
3597,These patients required treatment with medicines that prevented their blood from clotting but also did not cause additional risks of serious bleeding.
3598,Researchers collected information on bleeding events and other side effects of these medicines.
3599,This study started in August 2014 and finished in June 2017.
3602,Patients with atrial fibrillation usually take anti-blood-clotting medicines regularly to prevent the risk of strokes.
3603,"Such medicines are, for example, dabigatran and warfarin."
3604,"When these patients have a PCI procedure, they need to take additional anti-blood-clotting medicines in combination with their regular medicines."
3605,These additional medicines are needed to prevent the formation of blood clots in the stent put in place during the PCI procedure.
3606,"However, additional anti-blood-clotting medicines can also increase the risk of bleeding."
3607,Doctors who treat these patients need to be able to balance the risk of stroke and blood clots with the risk of bleeding.
3608,"If the risk of bleeding could be reduced, this would be an advantage for the patients."
3609,BI 1160.18614 Feb 2018 Page 2 of 7Which medicines were studied?
3610,"Researchers studied combinations of the following 2 types of anti-blood-clotting medicines: Anticoagulant medicines, which slow down the clotting process and reduce the amount of certain proteins needed to form clots."
3611,"In this study, these included dabigatran and warfarin."
3612,"Antiplatelet medicines, which prevent small blood cells called platelets from forming clumps that are needed to form clots."
3613,"In this study, these included clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and aspirin."
3614,One combination was dabigatran and 1 antiplatelet medicine (clopidogrel or ticagrelor).
3615,This combination of 2 medicines is called dabigatran dual therapy.
3616,"The other combination waswarfarin and aspirin, plus 1 of the other antiplatelet medicines mentioned above."
3617,This combination of 3 medicines is called warfarin triple therapy.
3619,The patients in this study had a heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation.
3620,They had just undergone PCI with stent placement within the past 5 days.
3621,"Overall, 2725 patients took part in the study: 2070 were men and 655 were women."
3622,"Onaverage, patients were 71 years old."
3623,The youngest patient was 29 years old and the oldest patient was 93 years old.

3626,Patients were divided into groups to take either dabigatran dual therapy or warfarin triple therapy as shown in the figure below.
3627,It was decided by chance who took dabigatran dual therapy and who took warfarin triple therapy.
3628,"Patients in the dabigatran dual therapy group were assigned to a lower dose of 110 milligrams (mg) or a higher dose of 150 mg, depending on their age."
3629,The dose of warfarin was determined by each patient s blood-clotting ability.
3630,The patients in the study and the study doctors knew which medicines the patients were taking.
3631,Study medicines were started 6 hours to 5 days after the PCI with stent placement.
3632,"Patients took 1 capsule of 110 milligrams (mg) of dabigatran twice daily, 1 capsule of 150 mg dabigatran twice daily, or warfarin once daily (the dose varied by patient)."
3633,Patients also took75 mg of clopidogrel once daily or 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily.
3634,"In the warfarin triple therapy group, patients also took aspirin once daily (the dose varied by patient)."
3635,Dabigatran and warfarin were to be continued for at least 6 months.
3636,"Clopidogrel and ticagrelor were to be continued for up to 12 months, and aspirin for up to 3 months."
3637,Researchers compared the occurrence of major or clinically relevant bleeding events in each dabigatran group compared to the warfarin group.
3638,A bleeding event was considered major if at least 1 of the following occurred: The patient required a transfusion of blood.
3641,A bleeding event was considered clinically relevant if at least 1 of the following occurred: The patient was admitted to the hospital.
3642,The patient required treatment.

3650,"If any bleeding event occurred, the doctor measured the time from starting the medicines until the event occurred."
3651,Doctors also collected information on any other side effects.
3653,The percentage of patients with major or clinically relevant bleeding events was lower in the dabigatran dual therapy groups than in the warfarin triple therapy groups.
3654,A total of 15.4% of patients in the dabigatran 110 mg dual therapy group had bleeding events compared with 26.9% of patients in the warfarin triple therapy group.

3659,"For the comparison, the only elderly patients included in these groups were from the United States."
3660,BI 1160.18614 Feb 2018 Page 5 of 7The results show that dabigatran dual therapy lowered the risk of having bleeding events compared with warfarin triple therapy (relative risk reduction of 48% in 110 mg group and of 28% in 150 mg group).
3661,Researchers used statistical tests on the results and found that they were reliable.
3663,"In addition to the important bleeding events described above, all other side effects were also collected."
3664,Patients in each of the dabigatran dual therapy groups had fewer side effects than the patients in the warfarin triple therapy group.
3665,"Overall, 24% of patients in the dabigatran 110 mg dual therapy group, 26% of patients in the dabigatran 150 mg dual therapy group, and 35% of patients in the warfarin triple therapy group had side effects."

3704,104 April 2018 Page 1 of 6A study of afatinib compared with methotrexate in patients with cancer of the head and neck that has returned or spreadThis is a summary of a clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer.
3708,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about afatinib and the treatment of head and neck cancer."
3710,The patients in this study had a type of cancer known as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
3711,This is a type of cancer of the mouth and throat.
3712,"Furthermore, the patients had already been treated, but their cancer returned or spread."
3713,The standard treatment for this type of cancer that has returned or spread includes platinum-based chemotherapy.
3714,"However, in many patients the cancer returns again, despite treatment with chemotherapy."
3715,The purpose of this study was to test how treatment with afatinib compared with methotrexate could help prevent further growth of cancer in patients whose cancer had returned after chemotherapy.
3716,"During the study, researchers also collected information on side effects of afatinib and methotrexate."
3717,This study started in January 2012 and finished in December 2016.
3719,New treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are needed.
3720,This type of cancer can grow and spread quickly.
3721,Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is a major cause of cancer-related illness and death.
3722,"Each year, more than 600,000 cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed worldwide."
3723,"The standard treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy."
3724,"Although some patients are free of disease after treatment, there is a risk that some cancer cells are left in the body and that tumours return."
3725,"More than half of patients treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery will have their cancer return or spread to other parts of the body."
3726,Afatinib is being studied to see if it can prevent the tumours from growing further in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
3727,"In this study, patients had been treated with chemotherapy but their cancer still grew."
3728,Methotrexate is a medicine approved for use in these patients.
3729,It is used after the first attempts at treatment fail and cancer returns or spreads.
3730,Researchers wanted to compare afatinib with methotrexate as treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
3731,"BI 1200.43, Primary Analysis, Revision No."
3732,104 April 2018 Page 2 of 6Which medicines were studied?
3734,Afatinib permanently blocks several growth factor signals (including a protein called EGFR).
3735,It is used in certain types of lung cancer that grow because of EGFR mutations.
3737,Methotrexate is another medicine that can prevent tumours from growing and spreading.
3738,"Methotrexate is used to treat cancer, including head and neck cancer."
3739,It is also used to treat other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and severe cases of psoriasis.
3740,Methotrexate is given by intravenous injection.
3743,All patients in this study were adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
3744,"Patients with cancer of the nasopharynx (upper throat behind the nose), sinuses, or salivary glands could not participate in the study."
3745,Patients in the study had cancer that had returned or spread to other parts of their body.
3746,"They had already received platinum-based chemotherapy, but the disease had continued to spread."
3747,They had tumours that could not be removed by surgery.
3748,"Overall, 483 patients took part in the study, including 412 men and 71 women."
3750,The youngest patient was 32 years old and the oldest patient was 88 years old.
3751,"Of these patients, 480 received either afatinib or methotrexate in the study."
3752,Three patients did not receive any study medicine.

3755,104 April 2018 Page 3 of 6How was this study done?
3756,About two-thirds of the patients (320 patients) in this study were treated with afatinib and the other 160 patients were treated with methotrexate.
3757,It was decided by chance who got which treatment.
3758,Patients and doctors knew if the patients were taking afatinib or methotrexate.
3759,Patients in the afatinib group began with a dose of 40 milligrams (mg) once a day.
3760,"Patients in the methotrexate group began at a dose based on their body size (40 mg per square metre of body surface area, or m2) once a week."
3761,Doses of each treatment could be increased or decreased depending on whether the patients had side effects that they could not tolerate.
3762,Patients were to take afatinib tablets or receive methotrexate injections until their cancer grew further or until they had side effects that they could not tolerate.
3763,All patients in the study followed the same procedures: The patients visited the doctor about once a week while they received study medicine.
3764,"At these visits, the patients answered questions about their health."
3765,"At some visits, tests were done to check if the patient s cancer had grown or if any new tumours had formed."
3766,Other assessments were also done to check the patient s health.
3768,"To see if afatinib or methotrexate could prevent the cancer from growing further, the researchers measured the time from starting the medicines until the cancer grew further or the patient died."
3769,This is called progression-free survival .
3773,The average progression-free survival was longer for patients who got afatinib than for patients who got methotrexate.
3774,The average progression-free survival was 2.63 months for patients who got afatinib and 1.74 months for patients who got methotrexate.
3775,These results are shown in the picture on the next page.
3776,The risk of the cancer growing further or the patient dying was 20% lower for patients in the afatinib group than for patients in the methotrexate group.
3779,"Overall, 85.4% of patients in the afatinib group and 83.9% of patients in the methotrexate group had their cancer grow further or died."
3780,Researchers also looked at overall survival.
3781,They found that there was no difference in average overall survival between patients who got afatinib and patients who got methotrexate.
3782,The average overall survival was 6.80 months in the afatinib group and 6.18 months in the methotrexate group.
3783,The risk of dying was about the same in both groups.
3787,"Overall, 68.3% of patients in the afatinib group and 70.8% of patients in the methotrexate group died during the study."
3789,104 April 2018 Page 4 of 6The results described above were based on an analysis conducted while the study was still in progress during 2014.
3790,"Once the study was completed, a final analysis confirmed these results."
3793,"In this study, 303 out of 320 patients (95%) in the afatinib group and 137 out of 160 patients (86%) in the methotrexate group had unwanted effects."

3830,The simplified title for the study is: A study of nintedanib to slow the amount of scarring in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis .
3832,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
3834,Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have scar tissue that accumulates in their lungs.
3835,The researchers wanted to know if patients who took a medicine called nintedanib for 6 months had less scar tissue than patients who took placebo for 6 months.
3836,"To test this, the researchers took special scans called high-resolution computed tomography, or HRCT, of each patient s chest."
3837,The scans were done at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months of treatment.
3838,Researchers also collected information on the unwanted effects of nintedanib.
3839,This study started in December 2013 and finished in October 2016.
3840,This study was stopped early because nintedanib and another medicine received approval for the treatment of IPF.
3841,"Because of this, fewer patients entered the study than were planned."
3842,The sponsor of thisstudy was Boehringer Ingelheim.
3844,This study examined if nintedanib slowed down the scarring in the lungs.
3845,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rare disease that causes scarring of the tissue inside the lungs.
3850,Researchers studied a medicine called nintedanib (also known as BIBF 1120).
3851,Nintedanib received approval during this study as a medicine used to treat patients with IPF.
3853,"Some patients in the study were treated with nintedanib, and the others were treated with a placebo."
3855,BI 1199.18712 Apr 2018 Page 2 of 4Who participated in the study?
3856,Patients who had been diagnosed with IPF within the last 5 years could take part in this study.
3857,Patients also had to be at least 40 years old.
3858,"Originally, researchers planned for 275 patients to take part."
3859,Nintedanib was approved for treating IPF before all planned patients were enrolled.
3860,"Therefore, only 113 patients tooknintedanib or placebo in the study."
3861,A total of 82 patients were men and 31 were women.
3862,The average age was 68 years.
3863,The youngest patient was 45 years old and the oldest patient was 88 years old.
3864,"On average, patients had been diagnosed with IPF about 1.5 years before the study started."
3865,"There were 67 patients in Canada, 24 patients in United States, and 22 patients in Turkey."
3869,"One group of 56 patients was given nintedanib, and the other group of 57 patients was given placebo."
3871,Patients took nintedanib capsules or placebo capsules twice a day.
3872,Patients in the nintedanib group started on a dose of 150 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
3873,This dose could be decreased if the patients had unwanted effects that they could not tolerate.
3874,It was planned for patients to be treated with either nintedanib or placebo for 6 months.
3875,"After this 6-month treatment period, patients in the nintedanib group could continue to takenintedanib."
3876,Patients in the placebo group could switch to take nintedanib.
3877,"Treatment was planned to continue for up to 18 months, but the study was stopped after the last patient had at least 6 months of treatment."
3878,Researchers measured the amount of scar tissue in each patient s lungs and assigned a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score.
3879,The QLF score for each patient was recorded at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months of treatment.
3881,Both treatment groups had similar QLF scores at the beginning of the study.
3882,"After 6 monthsof treatment, the average QLF score increased in both treatment groups compared with the beginning of the study."
3883,"Because the study was stopped early, there were not enough patients to reach clear conclusions on the results of this study."
3884,BI 1199.18712 Apr 2018 Page 3 of 4What unwanted effects did patients have?
3885,"During the 6-month treatment period, 44 out of 56 patients (79%) in the nintedanib group had unwanted effects."
3886,"In the placebo group, 33 out of 57 patients (58%) had unwanted effects."
3887,The most common unwanted effects seen in at least 10% of patients in either group are shown in the table below.

3889,"In the placebo group, 3 out of 57 patients (5%) had serious unwanted effects."
3894,These health problems are called unwanted effects.
3895,Some patients in the study had serious unwanted effects.
3896,An unwanted effect was serious if it caused the patient to go to the hospital or stay longer in the hospital.
3897,"It was also seriousif it needed a doctor's immediate attention, was life-threatening, or caused death."
3898,BI 1199.18712 Apr 2018 Page 4 of 4A total of 2 patients out of 56 patients (4%) in the nintedanib group died during the 6-month treatment period.
3899,"During this period, 4 patients out of 57 patients (7%) in the placebo group died."
3900,"Of these patients, 1 patient in the nintedanib group and 2 patients in the placebo group died due to unwanted effects."
3901,The patient who died in the nintedanib group had inadequate blood flow in the intestine (intestinal infarction).
3902,The patients in the placebo group died due to IPF and their lungs not functioning (respiratory failure).

3931,The purpose of this study was to find out if a medicine called nintedanib helps patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
3932,"During the study, researchers also collected information on side effects of nintedanib."
3933,This study started in May 2011 and finished in October 2013.
3936,"New medicines are needed to treat patients with IPF, a rare disease of the lung."
3937,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes scarring of the tissue inside the lungs.
3942,"Currently, there is no cure for IPF, and there are very few treatments for patients with IPF."
3943,The disease worsens over timeand will eventually lead to death.
3947,Nintedanib had already been tested in clinical studies in patients with IPF and in patients with various types of cancer.
3949,"Some patients in the study were treated with nintedanib, and the others were treated with placebo."
3951,BI 1199.3418 Aug 2017 Page 2 of 5Who participated in the study?
3953,They had to be at least 40 years old.
3954,A total of 548 patients were treated with nintedanib or placebo in the study.
3955,A total of 427 patients were men and 121 were women.
3957,The youngest patient was 42 years old and the oldest patient was 89 years old.
3958,"Many patients were from Asia (205 patients from China, India, Japan, and Korea)."
3959,"Some patients were from the European Union (184 patients from Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain)."
3960,"Other patients were from Canada (14 patients), Chile (11 patients), Mexico (7 patients), Russia (3 patients), Turkey (34 patients), and the United States(90 patients)."
3962,The researchers wanted to know if patients who took nintedanib did better in lung function tests than patients who took placebo.
3963,"To test this, the patients were divided into 2 groups."
3965,"One group of 329 patients was given nintedanib, and the other group of 219 patients was given placebo."
3967,The doctors also did not know it.
3969,Patients in the nintedanib group were started on a dose of 150 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
3972,"If patients taking placebo had side effects that they could not tolerate, the doctors could also lower the dose , or patients could stop taking the capsules for a while."
3973,It was planned for patients to be treated in the study for 1 year.
3974,"During their time in the study, all patients followed the same procedures: The patients visited the doctor every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks of the study."
3975,"After this, they visited the doctor every 6 weeks."
3976,The patients took lung function tests.
3977,The patients answered questions about their health and quality of life.
3978,The patients had blood tests to check their health.
3979,The doctors collected information on side effects.
3980,The doctors looked after each patient and checked results.
3981,They also discussed any health problems with the patients and did further medical tests when needed.
3982,"To see if nintedanib could slow down the worsening of lung function, the researchers used a special lung function test."
3983,This test measured how much air patients could forcefully blow out after inhaling deeply.
3984,Researchers call this measurement Forced Vital Capacity or FVC .
3985,The researchers measured how much FVC changed over 1 year.
3986,A greater decrease in FVC over 1 year meant a faster worsening of lung function.
3987,BI 1199.3418 Aug 2017 Page 3 of 5What were the results of this study?
3988,"On average, the lung function in patients who took nintedanib worsened less over 1 year compared with patients who took placebo."
3989,"In the nintedanib group, the yearly decrease in FVC, or the amount of air patients could forcefully blow out after inhaling deeply, was abouthalf of the average decrease in the placebo group."
3990,This is shown in the figure below.
3991,"To be sure that the results were reliable, researchers used statistical tests."
3992,They found that it was very unlikely that the results came about by chance.
3994,More patients in the nintedanib group (69%) than in the placebo group (26%) had side effects.
3995,The most common side effects affected the digestive system.
3996,These side effects were more common in patients who took nintedanib than in patients who took placebo.
3997,Side effects that were seen in at least 5% of patients in either treatment group are shown in the table on the next page.

4153,The simplified title for the study is: A study to identify the best dose of volasertib in children with acute leukaemia or advanced solid tumours .
4154,"We thank all patients, and the parents of patients, who took part in this study."
4155,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about volasertib and the treatment of cancer in children."
4157,Researchers wanted to find the highest dose of the medicine volasertib that children with cancer could tolerate.
4158,This dose would be used in future studies of childhood acute leukaemia and solid tumours.
4159,"The patients in this study were either children with acute leukaemia or children with advanced solid tumours, for whom no effective treatment was known."
4160,Researchers also collected information on the unwanted effects of volasertib.
4161,This study started in October 2013 and finished in February 2017.
4164,New treatments for childhood acute leukaemia and advanced solid tumours in children are needed.
4165,Treatments for childhood acute leukaemia have improved greatly over the past 50 years.
4166,"However, new treatments are needed for children whose cancers resist available treatments or return after treatment."
4167,"In addition, the current standard treatments for both acute leukaemia and advanced solid tumours have severe medicine-related side effects in children."
4168,Novel treatments with fewer side effects are needed.
4169,Volasertib is a potential new medicine for childhood acute leukaemia and solid tumours.
4170,"Before researchers can check if a new medicine works, they must first learn what the highest dose is that the patients can take before unwanted effects become too serious."
4172,Volasertib (BI 6727) is a new medicine which is given by infusion into a vein.
4174,Volasertib hasalready been studied as a treatment for adults with cancer.

4177,"Children with 2 types of cancer could take part in this study: Children with acute leukaemia who had already had at least 2 intensive treatments with no lasting success Children with advanced solid tumours for which no treatment was knownOverall, 22 patients were treated in this study."
4178,The patients were put into 2 age groups:Patients aged 2 to less than 12 years.
4179,There were 12 patients in this age group.
4180,Four patients had acute leukaemia and 8 had solid tumours.
4181,"In this group, the average age was 8 years."
4182,The youngest patient was 2 years old and the oldest patient was 11 years old.
4183,Half of this age group were boys and half were girls.
4184,Patients aged 12 to less than 18 years.
4185,There were 10 patients in this age group.
4186,Three patients had acute leukaemia and 7 had solid tumours.
4187,"In this group, the average age was 15 years."
4188,The youngest patient was 12 years old and the oldest patient was 17 years old.
4189,There were 8 boys and 2 girls in this age group.
4190,"Patients participated in the study in 7 countries in Europe: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom."
4192,Researchers wanted to know the highest dose of volasertib that patients in each age group could tolerate.
4194,They checked each group for certain severe unwanted effects.
4195,They determined the dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 patients had such unwanted effects.
4197,"It was determined in the first treatment cycle, which took 2 weeks in this study."
4199,Patients were given volasertib as an infusion into a vein for about an hour once every 2 weeks.
4200,Patients in each age group were assigned to volasertib dose groups by age and order of entering the study.
4201,"In each age group, the starting dose was 200 milligrams (mg) per square metre (m2) of body surface area."
4202,Patients could continue on treatment cycles of volasertib until they had unwanted effects that they could not tolerate or until their cancer got worse.
4204,119 Feb 2018 Page 3 of 7All patients followed the same procedures: The patients and their parents visited the doctor about every 5 days.
4205,"At these visits, blood was collected for safety tests, heart rhythm was measured, and patients and/or their parents answered questions about their health."
4206,"At some visits, the size of their tumour was measured or their bone marrow (the spongy tissue in the centre of bones) was checked."
4207,"At all visits, the doctors collected information on unwanted effects."
4208,The doctors looked after each patient and checked their test results.
4211,"In the age group of 2 years to less than 12 years, the patients took volasertib doses up to 300 mg/m2."
4212,No patient had a severe unwanted effect that would indicate that the dose was too high.
4213,"A safety committee decided to stop dose increases beyond 300 mg/m2, as patients did not show signs of disease improvement that would justify further dose increases."
4214,"Therefore, the recommended dose for this age group was found to be 300 mg/m2."

4262,The simplified title for the study is: The LUX-Lung 3 study compares treatment with afatinib to chemotherapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma that involves a mutated EGFR protein. We thank all patients who took part in this study.
4263,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about afatinib and the treatment of cancer."
4265,The patients in this study had a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) called adenocarcinoma.
4266,Lung cancer is called adenocarcinoma if it starts in the tube-like airways in the lung.
4267,The type of adenocarcinoma that the patients had in this study involved a protein called EGFR that was abnormally changed (this is called mutated).
4268,This mutated EGFR protein acts as a switch that can turn lung cancer cells on so that they grow out of control.
4269,The purpose of this study was to compare afatinib with chemotherapy as first therapy for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations.
4270,"During the study, researchers also collected information on side effects of afatinib."
4271,This study started in August 2009 and finished in March 2017.
4274,Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and it is difficult to treat.
4275,"In the past, patients with this type of cancer have taken chemotherapy as first therapy."
4276,But in many patients the cancer continues to grow and chemotherapy does not help all of them to live longer.
4277,Therefore researchers developed new treatments that block the mutated EGFR proteins.
4278,"One of these treatments is afatinib, which had already been shown in preliminary studies to help patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations."
4280,About two-thirds of the patients in this study were treated with afatinib (also known as BIBW 2992) and the other patients were treated with chemotherapy.
4281,Afatinib is a medicine that helps to stop cancer from growing and spreading.
4282,Afatinib permanently blocks several growth factor signals (including EGFR).
4285,"BI 1200.32Analysis of Overall Survival, Revision 113 Dec 2017 Page 2 of 6Chemotherapy is also used to help stop cancer cells from growing and spreading in the body."
4286,"In this study, the chemotherapy was a combination of 2 medicines called pemetrexed and cisplatin."
4287,The combination was given by infusion into a vein.
4290,All patients in this study were adults with lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations.
4291,They had not had any prior treatment for their advanced cancer.
4292,"Overall, 345 patients took part in the study, including 224 women and 121 men."

4297,A total of 229 patients were treated with afatinib and 111 patients were treated with chemotherapy.
4299,Patients and doctors knew if the patients were taking afatinib or chemotherapy.
4300,Patients in the afatinib group were started on a dose of 40 milligrams (mg) once a day.
4301,This dose could be increased or decreased depending on whether the patients had side effects that they could not tolerate.
4302,Patients in the chemotherapy group received infusions into a vein once every 3 weeks.
4303,"The infusions contained 2 medicines at the standard approved doses, which were pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg per square metre (m2) of body surface area and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2."
4304,This means that the dose depended on the size of the patient s body.
4305,"BI 1200.32Analysis of Overall Survival, Revision 113 Dec 2017 Page 3 of 6Patients were to take afatinib until their cancer grew or they could not tolerate the medicine."
4306,"It was planned that patients would receive up to 6 courses of chemotherapy, which would last about 5 months."
4307,Some patients had to stop treatment early because their cancer grewor because they had side effects that they could not tolerate.
4308,All patients in the study followed the same procedures: Patients had to visit the doctor twice to see whether they could take part in the study.
4309,Each treatment course took 3 weeks.
4310,"During the first 2 treatment courses, patients had to visit their doctor twice."
4311,"After that, patients visited their doctor once during each treatment course."
4312,"At each visit, the patients answered questions about their health."
4313,"At some visits, the doctors measured the size of the tumours and checked if any new tumours had formed."
4318,"In order to compare how well afatinib and chemotherapy worked in these patients with lung cancer, the researchers measured the time from starting the study medicine (afatinib or chemotherapy) until the cancer grew further or the patient died."
4323,"In this study, there was a difference in progression-free survival between patients who took afatinib and patients who received chemotherapy."
4324,The results were calculated 12 months after the last patient started treatment and then again at the end of the study.
4325,"After the 12 months, the average progression-free survival was 11.17 months for patients who took afatinib and 6.90 months for patients who had chemotherapy."
4326,The risk of the cancer growing further or the patient dying during this time was 42% lower for patients in the afatinib group than for patients in the chemotherapy group.
4327,"Overall, 48.1% of patients in the afatinib group and 22.0% of patients in the chemotherapy group had their cancer stop growing and were still alive after the 12 months."
4328,The results for progression-free survival calculated at the end of the study were similar to the results calculated after the 12 months.
4330,They found that the differences in progression-free survival were not likely due to chance.
4331,"At the end of the study, researchers found that there was no difference in overall survival between patients who got afatinib and patients who received chemotherapy."
4332,The average overall survival was 28.2 months for both groups.

4381,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about nintedanib and the treatment of cancer."
4383,"The patients in this study had cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or the abdominal lining (peritoneum)."
4384,The purpose of this study was to test whether adding a medicine called nintedanib to the standard treatment of chemotherapy could help patients live longer without further growth of their cancer.
4385,"During the study, researchers also collected information on side effects."
4386,This study started in December 2009 and finished in September 2016.
4389,Ovarian cancer is difficult to treat because most patients already have advanced cancer when they are diagnosed.
4390,"Also, removal of the tumour with surgery and then treatment with chemotherapy often does not fully cure these patients."
4391,"Over time, the cancer comes back or starts to grow again."
4392,Then it is much more difficult to treat.
4393,Adding another type of medicine to the chemotherapy at the beginning of treatment can help.
4394,Researchers wanted to see whether giving nintedanib with chemotherapy could help patients live longer without further growth of their cancer.
4396,Nintedanib (also known as BIBF 1120) is a medicine that helps to stop cancer from growing and spreading.
4398,It is used to treat a certain type of lung cancer in combination with a type of chemotherapy called docetaxel.
4400,About two thirds of the patients in this study were treated with nintedanib and one third of the patients were treated with placebo.
4401,"Placebo capsules looked like nintedanib capsules, but had no active medicine in them."
4402,Both nintedanib and placebo were given in addition to standard chemotherapy.
4403,"BI 1199.1503 January 2018 Page 2 of 7The chemotherapy in this study was a combination of 2 medicines, carboplatin and paclitaxel."
4404,These 2 medicines are used as standard treatment for patients with ovarian cancer.
4405,The chemotherapy was given by infusion into a vein.
4408,All patients were adult women with advanced ovarian cancer.
4409,Patients had undergonesurgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible before the study started.
4410,Patients had received no other type of treatment for their cancer.

4417,A total of 902 patients were treated with nintedanib and 450 patients were treated with placebo.
4418,The treatment with nintedanib or placebo was given in addition to chemotherapy.
4420,Neither patients nor doctors knew whether the patients were taking nintedanib or placebo.
4421,Patients in the nintedanib group started on a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
4422,This dose could be decreased if the patients had side effects that they could not tolerate.
4423,Patients received 6 courses of chemotherapy.
4424,"During this time, patients also took nintedanib or placebo."
4425,The chemotherapy infusions contained paclitaxel and carboplatin.
4426,The dose of paclitaxel and carboplatin depended on the size of the patient s body and how well their kidneys were functioning.
4427,"After 6 courses of treatment, patients stopped receiving chemotherapy and continued either nintedanib or placebo for the rest of the study."
4428,BI 1199.1503 January 2018 Page 3 of 7Some patients had to stop all treatment early because their cancer grew or because they had side effects that they could not tolerate.
4429,All patients in the study followed the same procedures: Patients had to visit the doctor once to see whether they could take part in the study.
4430,Each chemotherapy treatment course took 3 weeks.
4431,Patients had to visit their doctor once per week during the first treatment course.
4432,During the second treatment coursepatients had to visit their doctor twice.
4440,"To see if nintedanib with chemotherapy could prevent the cancer from growing further, the researchers measured the time from starting study treatment until the cancer grew furtheror until the patient died."
4441,This time is called progression-free survival .
4445,The main analysis for this study was done in 2013.
4446,"At the time of this analysis, 53.3% of patients in the nintedanib group and 58.5% of patients in the placebo group had their cancer grow again or died."
4447,The chance of the cancer growing further or the patient dying at any time during the study was 16% lower for patients in the nintedanib group than for patients in the placebo group.
4448,The average progression-free survival was longer (17.2 months) for patients in the nintedanib group than for patients in the placebo group (16.6 months).
4449,Results are shown in the figure on the next page.
4450,Researchers used statistical tests on the results to confirm that the results were reliable.
4451,They found that the differences in progression-free survival between the nintedanib group and the placebo group were probably not due to chance.
4452,"Once the study was completed, a final analysis showed similar results for progression-free survival."
4453,BI 1199.1503 January 2018 Page 4 of 7Researchers found that there was no difference in overall survival between patients in the nintedanib group and patients in the placebo group.

4501,The simplified title for the study is: A comparison of the safety of dabigatran and warfarin in patients who were undergoing catheter ablation for a heart rhythm disorder .
4503,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about dabigatran in patients undergoing catheter ablation for a heart rhythm disorder."
4505,"In this study, researchers compared the safety of 2 anti-blood-clotting medicines called dabigatran and warfarin, which prevent the formation of blood clots."
4506,The researchers tested these medicines in patients with the heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation and who were undergoing catheter ablation.
4507,Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of irregular heartbeat.
4508,It can lead to the formation of blood clots in the heart.
4509,These clots can travel from the heart to the brain and cause a stroke.
4510,"Therefore, patients with AF receive medicines that prevent blood clotting."
4511,"In addition, doctors sometimes use a procedure called catheter ablation to destroy a small area of the heart that causes the irregular heartbeat."
4512,"Catheter ablation is another treatment for patients with AF who have already tried medications, but these did not work or caused side effects."
4513,A small flexible plastic tube (catheter) is put into a vein and moved into the heart where the ablation is done.
4514,Blood clots can form in the heart during this procedure.
4515,The patients therefore continue to receive anti-blood-clotting medicines during and after this procedure.
4516,"In this study, researchers compared the safety of the medicines dabigatran and warfarin."
4517,"These medicines prevent blood clots, but they can also cause bleeding."
4518,"Therefore,researchers wanted to know how often the patients in the study had serious bleeding eventsduring and after this procedure."
4519,They also collected information on other side effects of these medicines.
4520,This study started in May 2015 and finished in November 2016.
4523,Dabigatran is used in many countries to prevent stroke in patients with AF.
4524,"Doctors knew that keeping patients on the same anti-blood-clotting medicine was important, so they tested keeping patients on dabigatran before, during, and after a catheter ablation procedure."
4525,The researchers compared the constant use of dabigatran with the constant use of warfarin in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF.
4526,BI 1160.20406 Sep 2017 Page 2 of 5Which medicines were studied?
4527,The researchers studied a medicine called dabigatran.
4528,Dabigatran helps to prevent blood from clotting.
4530,Dabigatran was compared to warfarin in this study.
4532,Patients in this study had AF that their doctors believed was best treated with catheterablation.
4533,Patients could be in the study if they had a catheter ablation procedure planned within 8 weeks after entering the study.
4534,"Overall, 676 patients were treated: 502 were men and 174 were women."
4535,"On average, patients were 59 years old."
4536,The youngest patient was 25 years old and the oldest patient was 84 years old.
4537,"Of the 676 patients, 635 patients started the catheter ablation procedure."
4538,The table below lists the regions and countries where these patients took part in the study.

4540,Patients were divided into 2 groups of similar size to receive treatment with either dabigatran or warfarin.
4542,The patients in the study and the study doctors knew what medicine the patients were taking.
4543,The patients in each group took the following medicine each day for 4 to 8 weeksbefore the catheter ablation procedure.
4544,They took the medicine on the day of the catheter ablation procedure.
4545,They also took the same medicine up to 8 weeks after the catheter ablation procedure.
4546,"The 2 groups were:Dabigatran group: 1 capsule of 150 milligrams (mg) dabigatran twice per dayWarfarin group: Tablets of warfarin, with the dosing determined by each patient s blood-clotting abilityExcept for taking the different medicines, all patients followed the same procedures: Patients visited the study doctor:o 2 times before the catheter ablation procedureo At the hospital during and overnight after the catheter ablation procedureBI 1160.20406 Sep 2017 Page 3 of 5o About 3 times after the catheter ablation procedure Patients had measurements of their heart rhythm taken before, during, and after the catheter ablation procedure."
4547,Patients had a test that used sound waves to look at the heart before the catheter ablation procedure.
4548,Doctors took blood samples at each visit.
4549,Patients taking warfarin had samples taken in between doctor visits as well.
4550,Researchers compared the safety of dabigatran and warfarin in patients with AF who had a catheter ablation procedure.
4551,"To do this, the study doctors watched the patients carefully for any bleeding events during and after the catheter ablation procedure."
4553,The bleeding occurred in an important place in the body (such as around the heart).
4554,The bleeding caused a risk to the patient s life.
4555,Doctors also collected information on other side effects.
4557,"During and after the catheter ablation procedure, the percentage of patients who had major bleeding events was lower in the dabigatran group (2%) than in the warfarin group (7%)."
4558,The picture below shows the number of patients with major bleeding events during or after the catheter ablation procedure.
4559,"The major bleeding events that patients had in this study included bleeding inside the skull, bleeding around the heart, bleeding in the groin (the inside of the thigh), bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, and swelling filled with blood."
4560,The number of patients who had major bleeding events was lower in the dabigatran group than in the warfarin group.

4606,The simplified title for the study is: A study of nintedanib in treating patients with metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer .
4610,The purpose of this study was to test how well nintedanib worked in patients who hadcolorectal cancer that could not be cured (advanced disease) or had spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease).
4612,This study started in October 2014 and finished in August 2016.
4615,Colorectal cancer is difficult to treat.
4616,About half of patients with colorectal cancer eventually develop metastatic disease.
4617,"In most patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, the standard treatments that are available will stop working sooner or later."
4618,New treatment options are needed for patients with colorectal cancer who have stopped responding to the available standard treatments or who cannot tolerate these treatments.
4620,Nintedanib (also known as BIBF 1120) is a medicine that helps to slow the growth and spread of certain types of cancer.
4621,Nintedanib blocks the activity of a group of proteins which are involved in the development of new blood vessels that cancer cells need to supply them with food and oxygen.
4622,"By blocking the activity of these proteins, nintedanib can help stop the growth and spread of the cancer."
4624,About half of the patients in the study were treated with nintedanib and the other half were treated with placebo.
4626,Researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or causes more side effects than not taking anything.
4627,BI 1199.5215 Aug 2017 Page 2 of 6Who participated in the study?
4628,All patients were adults with metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer.
4629,All patients in this study had stopped responding to the available standard cancer treatments or they could no longer tolerate taking them.
4630,The only remaining therapy available to the patients was best supportive care .
4631,Best supportive care is therapy that does not target the cancer but rather helps to make the patient feel more comfortable and improves the patient s quality of life.
4632,"Best supportive care treatments may include medicines to help with pain, nausea and vomiting, or bacterial infections."
4633,"These treatments may also include surgery, blood transfusions, or nutritional treatments."
4634,"Overall, 768 patients took part in the study, including 454 men and 314 women."
4638,"Geographical Region Countries Number of PatientsWestern Europe Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom369 patientsAsia Hong-Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan 193 patientsNorth America Canada, United States of America 63 patientsAustralia Australia 26 patientsRest of the World Argentina, Czech Republic, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey117 patientsHow was this study done?"
4641,One group of patients was given nintedanib (plus best supportive care) and the other group of patients was given placebo (plus best supportive care).
4642,Patients and doctors did not know if they were taking nintedanib or placebo.
4643,"Patients took nintedanib capsules or placebo capsules by mouth, twice a day."
4644,Patients in the nintedanib group were started on a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) twice a day.
4645,"If patients experienced side effects that they could not tolerate, the dose was decreased to 150 mg twice a day, or further decreased to 100 mg twice a day."
4646,"Patients continued treatment with nintedanib or placebo until their cancer got worse, or until they had side effects that they could not tolerate and a further dose reduction was not possible."
4647,BI 1199.5215 Aug 2017 Page 3 of 6All patients in the study followed the same procedures: The patients visited the doctor about once every 3 weeks.
4649,"At some visits, the size of their tumour was measured and their blood was tested to check their health."
4651,"In order to measure the effectiveness of nintedanib in patients with colorectal cancer, the researchers measured the following: The time from starting study treatment (nintedanib or placebo) until the cancer got worse or the patient died (this was called progression-free survival )."
4652,The time from starting study treatment (nintedanib or placebo) until the patient died (this was called overall survival ).
4654,"In this study, there was a difference in progression-free survival between patients who tooknintedanib and patients who took placebo."
4655,"At the time the results were analysed, 350 patients in the nintedanib group and 337 patients in the placebo group had their cancer get worse or had died."
4656,The average (median) time it took from starting study treatment until the cancer got worse or the patient died was 1.51 months for patients who took nintedaniband 1.38 months for patients who took placebo.
4657,The risk of the cancer getting worse or the patient dying over time was lower for patients in the nintedanib group than for patients in the placebo group.
4659,They found that thisdifference in progression-free survival was not likely due to chance.
4660,"In this study, there was no meaningful difference in overall survival between patients who took nintedanib and patients who took placebo."
4661,"At the time the results were analysed, 318 patients in the nintedanib group and 295 patients in the placebo group had died."
4662,The average (median) time it took from starting study treatment until the patient died was 6.44 months for patients who took nintedanib and 6.05 months for patients who took placebo.
4664,They found that the difference in overall survival between the treatment groups was likely due to chance.

4707,The simplified title for the study is: BI 695501 compared to Humira in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis .
4711,"In this study, researchers wanted to see if a medicine called BI 695501 worked as well as Humira (adalimumab) in helping patients with active rheumatoid arthritis."
4712,Researchers also collected information on any side effects patients had during the study.
4713,This study started in February 2015 and finished in October 2016.
4716,The purpose of this study was to see if BI 695501 works as well as Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
4717,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition that can cause a person s jointsto become swollen, red, and painful."
4718,"If not treated, severe rheumatoid arthritis can leadto permanent joint damage."
4719,It may also cause problems in other parts of the body such asthe lungs and eyes.
4720,Humira is a medicine used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in patientswho have active disease despite their taking other medicines.
4721,"The new medicine,BI 695501, has been designed to be similar to Humira."
4726,Humira and BI 695501 reduce the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by binding to TNF and blocking its effects.
4727,All patients in this study also took methotrexate.
4728,"Methotrexate is a medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis, taken by mouth, which slows down the body s immune system."
4729,BI 1297.223 Aug 2017 Page 2 of 7Who participated in the study?
4730,Patients could be in this study if they had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.
4731,It musthave been active for at least 6 months.
4732,They also had to be receiving treatment with methotrexate.
4733,Patients were to have at least 6 swollen joints and at least 6 tender jointsat the study start.
4734,"Patients could not be in the study if they had certain infections, a weak immune system, or severe heart failure."
4735,"Overall, 645 patients were treated in the study."

4743,Neither the patients in the groups nor the study doctors knew which kind of treatment the patients got.
4744,The patients in each group received 1 of the following medicines as an injection under the skin every 2 weeks:BI 695501: 40 milligramsHumira: 40 milligramsThe first 24 weeks of treatment was called Period 1.
4745,"After Period 1 ended, half of the patients treated with Humira were switched to BI 695501."
4746,The other patients continued to get Humira.
4747,The study doctors switched the treatment in these patients to see if changingtheir treatment changed the effects of the treatment.
4748,Neither the patients in the groupsnor the study doctors knew whether the patients treatment was changed.
4749,All patientswere then treated for another 24 weeks.
4750,This second treatment period was calledPeriod 2.
4751,"In total, patients in this study got BI 695501 or Humira injections every 2 weeksover 48 weeks."
4752,The picture on the next page shows the design of the study.
4753,"BI 1297.223 Aug 2017 Page 3 of 7Except for taking the different medicines, all patients followed the same procedures: Patients went to the study doctor every 1 to 8 weeks."
4755,Doctors collected information on the patients rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
4757,"Patients had measurements of their heart rhythm taken at certain visits(electrocardiograms, or ECGs)."
4758,The doctors reviewed the blood test and heart rhythm results.
4759,They discussed any health problems with the patients and performed further medical tests when needed.
4760,The doctors wanted to know whether patients treated with either Humira or BI 695501 had improvements in their rheumatoid arthritis symptoms after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment.
4761,The doctors used a measurement called the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20).
4762,"For this measurement, the doctors lookedat certain blood test results, counted swollen and tender joints, and asked patients abouttheir pain and how well they were doing in their daily lives."
4763,The doctors wanted to know ifthe percentage of patients who improved after BI 695501 treatment was the same as thepercentage of patients who improved after Humira treatment.
4765,More than 60% of patients who got BI 695501 or Humira had an improvement in their rheumatoid arthritis symptoms in Period 1 as measured by the ACR20.
4766,The researchers compared the percentage of patients who improved after treatment with BI 695501 and Humira.
4767,The researchers found that both treatments were equally effective in improving patient symptoms.
4768,Statistical tests showed that the results were unlikely to be due tochance.

4801,Lay summary 1321.3BI 1321.3Final Analysis17 Aug 2017 Page 1 of 6This is a summary of a clinical study of a medicine called idarucizumab in patients who take another medicine called dabigatran.
4804,The simplified title for the study is: A study to test how well idarucizumab stops the anti-blood-clotting effect of dabigatran.
4805,Patients were in an emergency situation where bleeding had to be controlled .
4807,"Through your participation, you helped researchers answer important questions about idarucizumab and its effect on dabigatran."
4808,This study started in June 2014 and finished in October 2016.
4811,The purpose of the study was to examine how well idarucizumab restores normal blood clotting in patients taking dabigatran.
4812,Anti-blood-clotting medicines like dabigatran are often taken by people with heart rhythm problems.
4813,Conditions such as these may cause a blood clot to form in the heart.
4814,"If such a blood clot is transported to the brain, it can cause a stroke."
4815,"Blood clots can also lead to a deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot, usually in a leg, which may causepain, swelling, or redness."
4816,Dabigatran prevents the blood from clotting in these situations.
4817,Dabigatran therefore lowers the risk that these medical conditions occur or recur.
4818,"Patients may sometimes have accidents, or rarely, unexpected bleeding events."
4819,Accidents may need to be treated with emergency surgery.
4820,Bleeding during surgery needs to be minimized.
4821,"Like any other blood thinner, dabigatran affects blood clotting."
4822,Normal blood clotting must be restored quickly before the doctor can begin surgery or other treatment.
4823,"Idarucizumab is given to stop the effects of dabigatran, allowing the doctor to begin treatment for the emergency immediately."
4824,The study doctors also collected information on side effects.
4825,Which medicine was studied?
4826,The medicine studied was idarucizumab (BI 655075).
4827,Idarucizumab is a medicine that stopsthe effects of a medicine called dabigatran.
4828,Dabigatran is a medicine that helps to prevent blood from clotting.
4829,The figure on the next page shows how idarucizumab stops the effects of dabigatran.
4830,BI 1321.3Final Analysis17 Aug 2017 Page 2 of 6Who participated in the study?
4831,"Most patients had heart rhythm problems, and all patients were taking dabigatran."
4832,"Patients must have had a medical emergency to be in the study, such as a car accident, a fall, or uncontrolled bleeding."
4833,Patients were entered into the study because they had either uncontrolled bleeding or other emergencies that required immediate attention.
4834,This study tested whether idarucizumab could stop the effects of dabigatran in these patients.
4835,A total of 503 patients were treated in this study.
4836,Almost all patients were elderly.
4837,"Some had serious illnesses such as high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes, a prior stroke, bleeding,or cancer."
4838,Other patients had serious injuries due to a bad accident.
4839,The average age was 77 years.
4840,The youngest patient was 21 years old and the oldest patient was 96 years old.
4841,There were 274 men (55% of patients) and 229 women (46%).
4842,Patients were from: Europe (225 patients) Australia-New Zealand (156 patients) North America (64 patients) Asia (31 patients) Latin America (6 patients) 4 other countries (21 patients)How was this study done?
4843,"In this study, patients were treated in a real-world emergency situation."
4844,Either the patientswere bleeding or they needed emergency surgery for a condition unrelated to dabigatran.
4845,They received idarucizumab intravenously.
4846,This means that the medicine was given directly in a vein in the arm.
4847,Patients with uncontrolled bleeding who needed medical help were entered into Group A.
4848,Patients who needed emergency surgery were entered into Group B.
4849,The patients and the study doctors knew that both groups were being treated withidarucizumab.
4850,Each patient received idarucizumab only on the day of the emergency.
4851,Patients received 1 dose of idarucizumab given in 2 shots.
4852,The shots were given within a maximum of 15 minutes of each other.
4853,"The total dose was 5 g. In addition, patients received all other treatments their doctor thought were necessary due to their emergency."
4854,The 5 days after getting idarucizumab were called the on-treatment period .
4855,The figure on the next page shows how the study was conducted.
4856,Blood clots slowly because Dabigatranblocks Thrombin.
4857,Thrombin is needed for blood clotting.
4858,T TBlood clots quickly because Thrombin is free.
4859,Idarucizumabblocks Dabigatran.
4860,IDT DBI 1321.3Final Analysis17 Aug 2017 Page 3 of 6Researchers wanted to know if blood clotting returned to normal after idarucizumab was given.
4861,Normal meant that blood would clot as quickly as in a person who did not take dabigatran.
4862,Researchers call this the reversal effect of idarucizumab.
4863,Researchers analysed the average (median) maximum reversal.
4864,The procedures during the emergency surgeries and treatments varied from patient to patient.
4865,"However, the following procedures were completed for patients in the study where possible: Study doctors collected blood samples at 6 time points within the first 24 hours after a patient took idarucizumab."
4866,Study doctors checked patients for any side effects.
4867,Researchers measured the time it took for a patient s blood samples to clot before and after the patient got idarucizumab.
4868,These blood-clotting times helped researchers to learn aboutthe ability of idarucizumab to block the effects of dabigatran.
4870,"In nearly all patients, blood clotting was reversed to normal condition after idarucizumabwas given."
4871,This effect happened quickly within a few minutes after idarucizumab was given.
4872,For the majority of patients the effect lasted up to 24 h. Patients in both groups showed a 100% stopping of the anti-blood-clotting effect of dabigatran when researchers analysed the maximum reversal within 4 hours.
4873,"In a few cases, re-bleeding or continuation of bleeding occurred."
4874,This required additional idarucizumab treatment.
4875,The figure on the next page shows the overall results.
4876,BI 1321.3Final Analysis17 Aug 2017 Page 4 of 6Doctors keep track of all healthproblems patients have during a study.
4877,"In this study, most health problems were caused by the illness or emergency the patients had."
4878,"Others might be caused by the study medicines, and some by other medicines taken by the patient."
4879,Some have yet a different cause.
4880,Here we describe health problemsthat the doctors thought were caused by the study medicines.
4883,Doctors noted side effects for 25 patients (5%) in the study during the first 5 days after they receivedidarucizumab.

4886,Two of these patients (less than 1%) had to stop taking the study medicine due to their serious side effects.
4887,One patient had a suspected case of anaphylactic shock.
4888,This is a serious allergic reaction causing difficulty in breathing or dizziness and was life-threatening.
4889,"The other patient had slow heartbeat, low blood pressure, and low levels of oxygen in the blood."
4890,Other serious side effectswere reported by 1 patient each.
4891,"These were stroke, bleeding in the brain, heart attack, and heart stopped."
4892,Researchers from the sponsor of the study investigated these events.
4893,They found that these patients had other health problems that could also have caused these serious events.
4894,Some patients had life-threatening illnesses or emergencies which were present prior to getting the study medicine.
4895,"Many of these patients died due to these events, which were not caused by the study medicine."
4896,"Over the entire study, 101 patients (20%) died."

4934,Researchers collected information on the side effects of nintedanib.
4935,This study started in March 2011 and finished in April 2016.
4938,"Advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer is difficult to treat."
4939,"Even after treatment, the cancer often returns."
4940,"Therefore, new treatments are needed for these types of cancer."
4941,"To find out if a new medicine will help these patients, researchers must first learn what the highest dose is that patients can take before side effects become too serious."
4943,Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is a medicine which is taken as a capsule by mouth.
4944,"During the study, patients also received chemotherapy."
4945,The chemotherapy medicines were called carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD).
4947,"All patients were adult women who had at least 1 course of previous treatments for ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer."
4948,Patients had received up to 3 series of chemotherapybefore the study.
4949,Patients must have been free of cancer for at least 6 months since their last treatment.
4950,Patients must have been able to have carboplatin and PLD chemotherapyduring the study.
4951,"Overall, 19 patients took part in the study."
4952,All of the patients were in Spain.
4953,The average age was 55 years.
4954,The youngest patient was 36 years old and the oldest patient was 71 years old.
4955,BI 1199.11927 Jun 2017 Page 2 of 5How was this study done?
4956,Researchers wanted to know which dose would be the highest that patients could tolerate without having certain side effects.
4957,These were side effects that would limit the dose a patient could take if they occurred during the first 28 days of treatment: Life-threatening blood problems Severe or life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (neutropenia) or blood clotting (platelets) Moderate to severe diarrhoea despite appropriate treatment Abnormal results of liver tests Other severe side effectsBoth the study doctor and the patients knew what dose of nintedanib they were getting.
4958,Patients took the study medicine and the chemotherapy during time periods called treatment cycles.
4959,A treatment cycle lasted 28 days.
4960,"On the first day of a cycle, patients received the intravenous (IV) chemotherapy."
4961,"On all other days, patients took the nintedanib dose twice each day by mouth (capsules)."
4962,Researchers divided patients into 2 groups.
4963,The first group of 7 patients was to take the starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg) nintedanib twice daily.
4964,"If dose-limiting side effects occurred in no more than 1 patient during the first treatment cycle, the dose of nintedanib would be increased to 200 mg twice daily for the next group of 6 patients."
4965,"If dose-limiting side effects occurred in more than 1 patient during the first treatment cycle, the dose of nintedanib would be lowered to 100 mg twice daily."
4966,"After the highest tolerable dose was determined, a third group of 6 new patients entered the study."
4967,These patients took the highest tolerated dose of nintedanib and the chemotherapy.
4968,Researchers wanted to know what side effects these additional patients had at the highest tolerated dose.
4969,"Chemotherapy cycles were repeated 6 to 9 times, or until the patient s cancer got worse."
4970,"After the patients had completed their cycles of chemotherapy, they continued to take nintedanib alone until their cancer progressed or they experienced a serious side effect."
4971,The figure on the next page shows the design of this study.
4972,BI 1199.11927 Jun 2017 Page 3 of 5What were the results of this study?
4973,The highest dose of nintedanib that patients tolerated was 200 mg twice daily.
4974,Only 1 patient in Group 1 had a dose-limiting event during the first treatment cycle.
4975,This event was abnormal results of liver tests.
4976,The tests showed large increases in liver enzymes.
4977,"Similarly, only 1 of 6 patients who took 200 mg of nintedanib twice daily had a dose-limiting event during the first treatment cycle."
4978,This patient s event was also an increase in liver enzymes.
4979,"Therefore, an additional group of 6 patients entered the study and were treated with the 200 mg dose twice daily."

5147,Does BI 655130 help participants with palmoplantar pustulosis more than placebo?
5148,We wanted to see if BI 655130 helps participants with palmoplantar pustulosis more than placebo.
5149,"To do this, we compared participants symptoms before they took BI 655130 and 16 weeks later."
5150,We also measured how much of a participant s skin was covered by palmoplantar pustulosis before taking BI 655130 and 16 weeks later.
5151,We also made these comparisons for participants taking placebo.
5152,We wanted to see if participants who took BI 655130 showed improvement and compare this to any improvement shown by participants who took placebo.
5153,Will participants have any unwanted effects?
5154,We wanted to know if participants had any unwanted effects.
5155,Unwanted effects are health problems that the doctors think were caused by BI 655130 or placebo.
5157,Did BI 655130 help participants with palmoplantar pustulosis more than placebo?
5158,We found that there was no difference in improvement of palmoplantar pustulosis between participants who took BI 655130 and participants who took placebo.
5159,Symptoms improved for a similar proportion of participants in all groups.

8658,1245-0025-lay-summary This study was to find out: Does empagliflozin increase or decrease the chance of having serious cardiovascular problems in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease?
8659,Patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to get cardiovascular disease and to die from it.
8660,Each participant took each day A study of heart safety in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease who are treated with empagliflozin (1245.25) 10 mg or 25 mg empagliflozin 7020 participants from 42 countries all over the world took part.
8661,Participants who took part had type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease 28% of participants who took empagliflozin and 24% of participants who took placebo had unwanted effects.
8662,12.4 2019 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH Participants taking empagliflozin had a smaller chance of getting serious cardiovascular problems than participants taking placebo.
8663,"Empagliflozin lowered the chance of having a heart attack, a stroke, or dying due to cardiovascular disease by 14%."

8669,You helped us to answer important questions about empagliflozin and the treatment of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
8671,The purpose of this study was to find out whether people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease who took a medicine called empagliflozin were more likely or less likely to have serious cardiovascular problems.
8672,People with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have cardiovascular disease and to die from cardiovascular disease than from any other cause.
8673,Empagliflozin is a medicine that lowers blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes.
8674,"It is important to find out whether medicines that are given to treat type 2 diabetes make cardiovascular disease more likely, or whether they may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease."
8676,People who had type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease could take part in the study.
8677,A total of 7020 participants were treated in the study.
8678,There were 5016 men (71% of participants) and 2004 women (29% of participants).
8680,The youngest participant was 30 years old and the oldest was 90 years old.

8683,The participants were divided into 3 groups of almost equal size.
8685,The groups were: Empagliflozin 10 mg group: participants took 1 tablet of 10 mg empagliflozin per day Empagliflozin 25 mg group: participants took 1 tablet of 25 mg empagliflozin per day Placebo group: participants took 1 tablet of placebo per day Placebo tablets looked like empagliflozin but did not contain any medicine.
8686,We compared empagliflozin with placebo to find out about the effect of empagliflozin.
8687,Participants were still taking all their usual medication (e.g.
8688,for type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease) as prescribed by their doctor.
8689,The participants and doctors did not know whether the participants were in one of the empagliflozin groups or in the placebo group.
8690,Participants in this study took empagliflozin or placebo tablets for about 2 years and 7 months on average.
8691,"Except for taking the different medicines, all participants followed the same procedures: Participants went to the study doctor every 4 to 14 weeks."
8694,"19 February 2020 BI 1245.25 Page 4 of 6 Participants had measurements of their heart rhythm taken at certain visits (electrocardiograms, or ECGs)."
8696,They discussed any health problems with the participants and performed further tests when needed.
8697,"The researchers wanted to know how many participants had a heart attack or a stroke, or died due to cardiovascular disease."

8712,"In the empagliflozin groups, 269 out of 4687 participants (5.7%) died from any cause."
8713,These results show that participants who took empagliflozin had a 32% lower chance of dying from any cause than participants who took placebo.
8715,"In the placebo group, 126 out of 2333 participants (5.4%) had a heart attack."
8716,"In the empagliflozin groups, 223 out of 4687 participants (4.8%) had a heart attack."
