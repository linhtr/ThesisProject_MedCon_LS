0,Thank you!
1,"As a clinical trial participant, you belong to a large community of participants around the world."
2,You help researchers answer important health questions and discover new medical treatments.
3,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug AIN457, also called secukinumab."
4,This trial started in June 2011 and was finished in April 2013.
5,You and all of the 738 participants helped researchers find out if AIN457 helps adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
6,"Novartis, the sponsor of this trial, thanks you for your help and thinks it is important for you to know the results of your trial."
7,An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the trial results for you.
8,We hope it helps you understand and feel proud of your important role in medical research.
9,"If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your trial site."
10,Clinical Trial RESULTS Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: AIN457 U.S. National Clinical Trial #: NCT01365455 Eudra Clinical Trial #: 2010-023512-13 Protocol #: CAIN457A2302 Trial Date: June 2011 to April 2013 2 Clinical Trial RESULTS WHAT S HAPPENED SINCE MY TRIAL ENDED?
11,"You were in the trial for up to 60 weeks, but the entire trial took almost two years to finish, because some patients started the trial later than others."
12,"The trial had 738 participants at 88 sites in 12 countries in the European Union, Asia, North America and South America."
13,"When the trial ended in April 2013, the sponsor reviewed all the data and created a report of the results."
14,This is a summary of that report.
15,WHY WAS THE RESEARCH NEEDED?
16,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat plaque psoriasis.
17,"This is the most common type of psoriasis, a long lasting disease that mainly affects the skin."
18,"It causes areas of thick, red, raised skin called plaques."
19,The plaques may be covered with silvery white buildup called scales and may itch or feel sore.
20,"In your clinical trial, researchers were studying a drug called AIN457, which may help relieve the symptoms of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis."
21,Researchers wanted to learn: Did AIN457 relieve psoriasis symptoms more than a placebo?
22,Did AIN457 still relieve psoriasis symptoms after 52 weeks?
23,Did AIN457 help in other ways?
24,What medical problems did patients have during the trial?
25,"To answer these questions, researchers asked for the help of people like you."
26,All the people in your trial had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months and were at least 18 years old.
27,WHAT KIND OF TRIAL WAS THIS?
28,This was a double-blind trial.
29,"This means none of the patients, trial doctors, or staff knew what treatment each patient received."
30,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment you are getting can affect the results of the trial.
31,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment patients took so they could create a report of the trial results."
32,3 Clinical Trial RESULTS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE TRIAL?
33,"For the first 48 weeks, the trial staff gave patients injections of the trial drug AIN457 or a placebo."
34,"A placebo is a pill or liquid that looks real, but does not contain any real medicine."
35,"During the trial and at Week 52 the trial staff measured your psoriasis symptoms, took blood and urine samples, and did physical examinations."
36,"Patients were put in 3 groups: 150 milligrams (mg) of AIN457: If you were in this group, you got 150 mg of AIN457 once a week until Week 4, then every 4 weeks until Week 48."
37,"300 mg of AIN457: If you were in this group, you got 300 mg of AIN457 once a week until Week 4, then every 4 weeks until Week 48."
38,"Placebo: If you were in this group, you got a placebo once a week until Week 4 and then once more at Week 8."
39,"If your symptoms improved after 12 weeks, you kept taking a placebo."
40,"If your symptoms did not improve, the trial staff switched you to 150 mg or 300 mg of AIN457 every week from Week 12 to Week 16, then every 4 weeks until Week 48."
41,Patients in the AIN457 groups also got some placebo injections.
42,This was done to make sure no one knew what treatment they got based on how often they got injections or what the injections looked like.
43,After the Week 52 visit there were 8 weeks of follow-up.
44,"You did not get any injections, but the trial doctors and staff checked your health and looked for signs of psoriasis."
45,Patients who took AIN457 had the option to be in another trial for AIN457 instead of the follow-up part of this trial.
46,4 Clinical Trial RESULTS The chart below shows how long the trial lasted and what treatments patients got in each group.
47,What Happened During the Study?
48,"Follow-up (8 Weeks) 0 12 Weeks 52 Weeks 48 Weeks 60 Weeks Not improved: switched to AIN457 (150 mg or 300 mg) until Week 48 Symptoms improved: kept taking placebo until Week 48 150 mg AIN457 until Week 48 300 mg AIN457 until Week 48 At the 52 week visit, patients who were taking AIN457 had the option to be in another trial for AIN457 instead of the follow-up part of this trial."
49,placebo until Week 12 No injections during the follow-up part of the trial Treatment (52 Weeks) WHAT WERE THE TRIAL RESULTS?
50,Did AIN457 relieve psoriasis symptoms more than a placebo?
52,"In your trial, the 150 mg and 300 mg dose of AIN457 both relieved psoriasis symptoms more than the placebo after 12 weeks of treatment."
53,Researchers used different tests to measure psoriasis symptoms.
54,"One test was called the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI."
55,It measures how severe your psoriasis is in 4 body areas.
56,Researchers wanted to learn how many patients had at least 75% less psoriasis and how many had at least 90% less psoriasis in these areas after 12 weeks of treatment.
57,"The other test was called the Investigator Global Assessment, or IGA."
58,"It measures psoriasis from 0 to 4, where 0 means no sign of psoriasis and 1 means almost no signs of it."
59,Researchers wanted to learn how many patients had no or almost no signs of psoriasis after 12 weeks of treatment.
60,5 Clinical Trial RESULTS The table below shows how many patients in each group had these results.
61,Relief of Psoriasis Symptoms after 12 Weeks of Treatment Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Test Investigator s Global Assessment (IGA) Test Treatment Group Patients with at least 75% less psoriasis Patients with at least 90% less psoriasis Patients with no or almost no signs of psoriasis 150 mg AIN457 174 of 243 patients (71.6%) 95 of 243 patients (39.1%) 125 of 244 patients (51.2%) 300 mg AIN457 200 of 245 patients (81.6%) 145 of 245 patients (59.2%) 160 of 245 patients (65.3%) Placebo 11 of 246 patients (4.5%) 3 of 246 patients (1.2%) 6 of 246 patients (2.4%) Did getting AIN457 still help patients with psoriasis symptoms after 52 weeks?
63,Most of the patients taking AIN457 still had at least 75% less psoriasis or still had no signs of psoriasis after 52 weeks.
64,The table below shows how many of the patients who had relief of psoriasis symptoms after taking AIN457 for 12 weeks still had these results after 52 weeks.
65,Continued Relief of Psoriasis Symptoms after 52 Weeks of Treatment Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Test Investigator s Global Assessment (IGA) Test Treatment Group Patients with at least 75% less psoriasis Patients with no or almost no signs of psoriasis 150 mg AIN457 126 of 174 patients (72.4%) 74 of 125 patients (59.2%) 300 mg AIN457 161 of 200 patients (80.5%) 119 of 160 patients (74.4%) 6 Clinical Trial RESULTS Did AIN457 help in other ways?
67,Patients answered questions about their quality of life and psoriasis symptoms during the trial.
68,"Researchers found: Patients who used electronic diaries and were getting AIN457 reported less itching, pain, and scaling than patients getting placebo at Week 12."
69,"Patients getting AIN457 had less pain, discomfort, anxiety, and depression than patients getting placebo at Week 12 and Week 52."
70,Patients getting AIN457 had fewer skin problems that affected their ability to do things (like working or studying) than patients taking placebo at Week 12 and Week 52.
71,WHAT MEDICAL PROBLEMS DID PATIENTS HAVE?
72,A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem.
73,"So when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that patients have."
74,These medical problems are called adverse events .
75,An adverse event is any sign or symptom occurring during treatment that may or may not be related to the trial drug.
76,How many patients had adverse events during the trial?
77,Some patients had adverse events during the trial and some left the trial because of adverse events.
78,Some patients also had serious adverse events.
79,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or needs hospital care."
80,No patients died during the first 52 weeks of the trial or the 8 week follow-up period.
81,"The table on the next page shows how many patients had adverse events, how many had serious adverse events, and how many left the trial due to adverse events."
82,"It includes all patients who took 150 mg of AIN 457, 300 mg of AIN 457, or a placebo during the first 52 weeks of the trial."
83,7 Clinical Trial RESULTS Adverse Events in the First 52 Weeks of the Trial Patients taking 150 mg of AIN457 (Out of 353 patients) Patients taking 300 mg of AIN457 (Out of 349 patients) Patients taking the placebo (Out of 247 patients) Had adverse events 287 patients (81.3%) 287 patients (82.2%) 124 patients (50.2%) Had serious adverse events 19 patients (5.4%) 19 patients (5.4%) 5 patients (2.0%) Left the trial due to adverse events 18 patients (5.1%) 12 patients (3.4%) 5 patients (2.0%) What were the most common adverse events in this trial?
84,The table below shows the most common adverse events in your trial.

87,"After agreeing to enter the Novartis website, type CAIN457A2302 into the keyword search box and click Go ."
89,Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which drugs work best and are safest for patients.
90,It takes volunteers in many trials around the world to advance medical science.
91,"Thank you It is said that the greatest gift is one which is given anonymously, giving when you do not know whether you will get direct personal benefit."
92,This is the gift that you have given by taking part in a clinical trial.
93,"It is a brave and selfless act, one that advances medical knowledge and benefits public health."
94,Thank you for the gift of your participation in clinical research.
95,The Center for Information & Study on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP) is a non-profit organization focused on educating and informing the public about clinical research participation.

97,"CISCRP 56 Commercial Wharf East, Boston, MA 02110 1-877-MED-HERO www.ciscrp.org"
99,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the study drug LJN452, also called tropifexor."
100,"You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how LJN452 works in people with primary bile acid diarrhea, also called PBAD."
101,Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important to share the results of the trial with you and the public.
103,We hope it helps you understand your important role in medical research.
104,"If you participated in the trial and have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your trial site."
105,What has happened since the trial ended?
106,You were in this trial for up to about 3 months.
107,The entire trial lasted about 1 year and 9 months.
108,This is because participants started and stopped at different times.
109,The trial started in April 2016 and ended in January 2018.
110,The researchers planned to include 30 participants in the trial.
111,"But, after reviewing the initial results, they found that LJN452 did not lower PBAD symptoms as much as the researchers expected."
112,It was also challenging for the researchers to find enough participants with PBAD suitable to join the trial.
113,"So, the researchers decided to stop the trial early."
114,The trial included 20 participants from 4 trial sites in the United Kingdom and the United States.
115,"After the trial ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
117,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: LJN452 (tropifexor) Protocol Number: CLJN452X2202 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
118,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat participants with PBAD.
119,"Before a drug can be approved for participants to take, researchers perform clinical trials to find out how safe it is and how well it works."
120,The information collected from many clinical trials is needed to find out if LJN452 improves the health of participants with PBAD.
121,The liver makes a substance called bile acid that helps people digest their food.
122,"Usually, the bile acid is taken up in the small intestine during digestion."
123,"But in people with PBAD, not all the bile acid gets taken up by the small intestine."
124,"So, the bile acid ends up in the large intestine."
125,This causes diarrhea.
126,LJN452 helps reduce the amount of bile acid that is produced by the liver.
127,"Researchers think that by reducing the amount of bile produced by the liver, less bile should reach the large intestine."
128,The researchers think this may help lessen diarrhea in participants with PBAD.
129,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if LJN452 works in a small number of participants with PBAD."
130,They also wanted to find out about the safety of LJN452 in participants with PBAD.
131,"To do this, the researchers compared LJN452 with a placebo."
132,A placebo looks like the trial drug but does not have any medicine in it.
133,Using a placebo helps researchers to understand the actual effect of a trial drug better.
134,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did LJN452 change how often the participants had bowel movements?
135,Did LJN452 change the form of the participants stools?
136,How much LJN452 got into the participants blood?
137,Did LJN452 change how much rescue medicine the participants used?
138,What medical problems did the participants have?
139,3 Clinical Trial Results What kind of trial was this?
140,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with PBAD."
141,The participants in this trial were 30 to 75 years old.
143,This means none of the participants or trial staff performing the tests knew what treatment each participants took.
144,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are taking can affect the results of the trial.
145,Doing a trial this way helps make sure the results are looked at fairly.
146,A computer program was used to randomly assign the treatment each participant took.
147,Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment is done as fairly as possible.
148,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor created a report of the trial results."
149,The sponsor staff did not know the identity of any of the participants.
150,What happened during the trial?
151,This trial was done in 2 parts.
152,"In each part, each participant took LJN452 or the placebo."
153,"By the end of the trial, each participant had taken both treatments."
154,"Before treatment started, the trial doctors did tests and checked the health of the participants to make sure they could take part in the trial."
155,"The participants could take rescue medicine during this time, if needed."
156,This is medicine participants could take to treat their PBAD symptoms right away.
157,"Before treatment started, the trial doctors gave the participants a diary to keep track of their bowel movements and when they took the rescue medicine."
158,"During treatment, the trial doctors took blood, urine, and stool samples."
159,They also checked the participants diaries and asked questions about the participants PBAD symptoms.
160,"In both parts of the trial, the participants took a single dose of either the trial drug or the placebo once a day for 14 days."
161,The participants took both the trial drug and the placebo in pill form by mouth.
162,"Participants used their diary to keep track of their bowel movements, when they took rescue medicine, and when they took the treatment."
163,4 Clinical Trial Results There were 1 to 4 weeks between Part 1 and Part 2.
164,"During this time, the participants did not take any treatment."
165,This was done to make sure any effects the researchers saw during each part were due to the treatment taken in that part.
166,The graphic below shows how the participants took their treatment during this study.
167,"Part 1 of the trial Part 2 of the trial 10 participants took LJN452 10 participants took the placebo 10 participants took LJN452 10 participants took the placebo No trial treatment for 1 to 4 weeks between Part 1 and Part 2 Washout period After treatment, the trial doctors took blood, urine, and stool samples."
168,They also collected the participants diaries and asked questions about the participants PBAD symptoms.
169,The chart below shows how the trial was done.
170,Before treatment Trial doctors checked that participants could join the trial The participants stopped taking their PBAD medicine before trial treatment started During treatment Part 1 20 participants took either LJN452 or the placebo for 14 days Part 2 20 participants took either LJN452 or the placebo for 14 days After treatment The participants visited their trial site 1 time Up to 4 weeks About 1 week after last doseAbout 14 days About 14 days No trial treatment between Part 1 and Part 2 1 to 4 weeks 5 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
171,"This is a summary of the overall results of your trial, not your individual results."
172,The results presented here are for a single trial.
173,Other trials may provide new information or different results.
174,You should not make medical decisions based on the results of a single trial.
175,Always talk to a doctor before making any changes to your medications or treatment plans.
176,All 20 participants took at least 1 dose of LJN452.
177,"But, 3 participants stopped taking the trial drug, so not all of their results are included below."
178,"For more information about the questions researchers wanted to answer, please check the websites listed at the end of this summary."
179,"If a full report of the study results is available, it can be found on those websites."
180,Did LJN452 change how often participants had bowel movements?
181,"After 2 weeks of trial treatment, the difference between the trial drug and the placebo was too small to know if LJN452 changed how often the participants had bowel movements."
182,"To answer this question, the researchers used the participants diaries to count how many times the participants had bowel movements."
183,They counted the participants bowel movements before they started treatment and during the 2 weeks of trial treatment.
184,The researchers learned that the participants had an average of: 18.8 bowel movements per week after taking LJN452 compared to an average of 18.0 bowel movements per week before taking LJN452.
185,17.5 bowel movements per week after taking the placebo compared to an average of 15.9 bowel movements per week before taking the placebo.
186,6 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows these results.

188,The number of participants in each treatment group was too small for the researchers to know if LJN452 changed the form of the participants stools.
189,"To answer this question, the researchers asked the participants to keep track of the form of their stools in their diaries."
190,"Every time the participants had a bowel movement, they scored the form of their stools using the Bristol Stool Chart, also called the BSC."
191,The BSC scores ranged from 1 to 7.
192,"A low score meant the stools were hard, lumpy, and were difficult to pass."
193,A high score of a 6 or 7 meant the stools were mushy with ragged edges or no solid pieces.
194,The graphic below shows the BSC.
195,"1 4 7 Hard, lumpy and di cult to pass Mushy ragged edges, no solid pieces 7 Clinical Trial Results The researchers counted the participants average BSC scores before they started treatment and during the 2 weeks of trial treatment."
196,They learned that: The participants had an average BSC score of 4.9 after taking LJN452 compared to 5.5 before taking LJN452.
197,The participants had an average BSC score of 5.1 both before and after taking the placebo.
198,The chart below shows these results.

200,"To answer this question, the trial doctors measured how much LJN452 got into the participants blood during the 2 weeks of treatment with LJN452."
201,They measured how much LJN452 was in the blood over the course of 24 hours after the first dose.
202,They also measured how much LJN452 was in the blood 8 hours after the last dose.
203,8 Clinical Trial Results This helped the researchers to find: The average highest level of LJN452 that got into the participants blood.
204,"This is measured in nanograms per milliliter, also called ng/mL."
205,The average amount of time it took LJN452 to reach the highest level in the participants blood.
206,This is measured in hours.
207,The average total amount of LJN452 measured in the participants blood from the first dose to the last dose.
208,"This is measured in hours multiplied by nanograms per milliliter, also called hr ng/mL."
209,The graphs below show an example of how the amount of a trial drug in the blood can change over time.
210,They do not show actual results from this trial.
211,Total amount of trial drug in the blood Time of dose A m ou nt o f tr ia l d ru g Total level of trial drug in the blood Time (hours) Highest level of trial drug in the blood Time of dose A m ou nt o f tr ia l d ru g highest level of trial drug in the blood Time (hours) amount of time to reach the highest level The researchers found that: The average highest level of LJN452 that got into the participants blood was 1.6 ng/mL after the first dose and 1.8 ng/mL after the last dose.
212,The average amount of time it took LJN452 to reach its highest level in the blood was 5.0 hours after the first and last dose.
213,The average total amount of LJN452 that got into the participants blood was 23.6 hr ng/mL after the first dose and 22.1 hr ng/mL after the last dose.
214,Did LJN452 change how much rescue medicine participants used?
216,LJN452 did not change how much rescue medicine the participants used.
217,"To answer this question, the researchers used the participants diaries to count how many participants took rescue medicine during each trial treatment."
218,"But, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if LJN452 changed how much rescue medicine the participants used."
219,9 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did the participants have?
220,Medical problems that happen in clinical trials are called adverse events .
221,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that participants have during a trial.
222,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care."
223,These problems may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
224,A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes an adverse event.
225,"During a trial, all adverse events are reported and written down, whether or not they are caused by the trial drug."
226,"So when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all adverse events that participants have."
227,This section is a summary of the adverse events that happened during this trial.
228,All 20 participants are included in these results because they all took at least 1 dose of trial drug.
229,How many participants had adverse events?
230,Fewer participants had adverse events while taking LJN452 than while taking the placebo.
231,None of the participants stopped taking treatment because of adverse events.
232,The table below shows how many participants had adverse events during this trial.

236,None of the participants died during this trial.
237,What were the most common adverse events?
238,The most common adverse event that happened in participants during this trial was headache.
239,This adverse event happened in a similar number of participants in both treatment groups.
240,The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened in 2 or more total participants.
241,"There were other adverse events, but these happened in fewer participants."
242,"Most common adverse events during this trial Adverse event LJN452 (Out of 17 participants) Placebo (Out of 19 participants) Total (Out of 20 participants) Headache 11.8% (2) 21.1% (4) 30.0% (6) Abdominal pain 5.9% (1) 5.3% (1) 10.0% (2) Chest pain not related to the heart 11.8% (2) 0.0% (0) 10.0% (2) Congestion in the nose 5.9% (1) 5.3% (1) 10.0% (2) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the websites noted at the end of this summary."
243,11 Clinical Trial Results How has this trial helped patients and researchers?
244,The results of this trial helped researchers better understand if LJN452 works in patients with PBAD.
245,The results from many trials are needed to find out which treatments can be used for patients with PBAD.
246,This summary shows only the main results from this 1 trial.
247,This trial was done in a small number of participants with a short treatment period.
249,"If other trials with LJN452 in participants with PBAD are planned, you will be able to find them on the websites listed below."

272,"As a clinical trial patient, you belong to a large community of patients around the world."
273,You helped researchers answer important health questions and discover new medical treatments.
274,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug CJM112.
275,You helped researchers learn more about how CJM112 works in people with chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
276,This trial started in June 2013 and ended in October 2015.
280,"If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor, research nurse, or other team member at your trial site."
281,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: CJM112 Protocol #: CCJM112X2101 Full Trial Title: A randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive controlled, single and multiple dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CJM112 in chronic plaque-type psoriasis patients Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: June 2013 to October 2015 2 Clinical Trial Results What s happened since the trial ended?"
282,"You were in this trial for up to about 16 weeks, but the trial took close to 2 years to complete."
283,The trial included 96 patients from 18 sites in the United States.
284,"When the trial ended in October 2015, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
286,Why was the research needed?
287,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
288,"This is the most common type of psoriasis, a long-lasting disease that affects mainly the skin."
290,The plaques may be covered with silvery-white build-up called scales that might itch or feel sore.
291,Researchers have found that people with plaque-type psoriasis have higher activity of an immune system protein called interleukin-17 (IL-17).
292,"The trial drug, CJM112, is a type of antibody that blocks IL-17."
293,Antibodies are normally made by the body s immune system to fight off infection.
294,"However, researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic plaque-type psoriasis."
295,Researchers wanted to see if CJM112 was safe to use and if it helped decrease psoriasis.
296,Researchers compared CJM112 with secukinumab (AIN457) and a placebo.
297,Secukinumab is a different type of antibody that is already available as a treatment option for psoriasis.
298,"A placebo looks like medicine, but does not have any real medicine in it."
299,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: What medical problems did patients have during the trial?
300,How much CJM112 got into the blood?
301,"Did CJM112 help treat psoriasis better than secukinumab, a placebo, or both?"
302,Did patients immune systems have a reaction to CJM112?
303,"To answer these questions, researchers asked for the help of men and women like you."
304,The patients in this trial were 20 to 65 years old and had chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
305,What kind of trial was this?
306,This trial was double-blind .
307,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, or staff knew what treatment each patient received."
308,"Patients in this trial took either CJM112, secukinumab, or placebo."
309,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment each patient is getting can affect the results of the trial.
310,"This way, it ensures that the results are looked at fairly."
311,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment patients received so they could create a report of the trial results."
312,3 Clinical Trial Results What happened during the trial?
313,This trial had 2 parts.
314,"Patients were enrolled in either Part 1, Part 2, or both."
315,The figure below shows how the trial was done.
316,Double-Blind Treatment: 96 Patients 44.1% Up to 16 weeks Part 1 Single Doses: 42 Patients Part 2 Multiple Doses: 54 Patients 16 weeks CJM112 5 mg CJM112 15 mg CJM112 50 mg CJM112 150 mg CJM112 450 mg Placebo CJM112 75 mg CJM112 250 mg CJM112 750 mg CJM112 1350 mg Secukinumab 1050 mg Placebo 4 11 11 6 6 10 10 4 4 4 14 12 Trial doctors did a full checkup of all patients to make sure they could join the trial.
317,"Patients were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to take either CJM112 or placebo (Part 1) or CJM112, secukinumab, or placebo (Part 2)."
318,"Throughout the trial, doctors took blood samples from the patients as well as checked their weight, temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate."
319,Part 1 lasted up to 16 weeks.
320,"Patients got 1 injection of either 5 milligrams (mg), 15 mg, 50 mg, 150 mg, or 450 mg CJM112 or placebo."
321,"At Week 4, patients returned to the doctor s office to record if their symptoms of chronic plaque-type psoriasis had lessened or not."
322,"About 1 month later, patients returned to the doctor s office again for a final visit."
323,Part 2 lasted 16 weeks.
324,Patients got 9 different injections over a 12 week period.
325,"Some received CJM112, some received secukinumab, and some received placebo."
326,"The total doses over the 12-week period for the 4 groups of CJM112 were 75 mg, 250 mg, 750 mg, and 1350 mg."
327,"The total dose of secukinumab was 1050 mg. At Week 12, patients returned to the doctor s office to record if their symptoms of chronic plaque-type psoriasis had improved or not improved."
329,4 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
332,Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which drugs work best and are safest for patients.
334,You should not make changes to your treatment based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
337,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that patients have."
339,An adverse event is any sign or symptom during the trial that may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
341,The tables below show how many patients had adverse events during this trial.
342,"The tables include all patients who took CJM112, no matter which dose they got, as well as all patients who took the placebo."
343,Adverse Events in Part 1 CJM112 Total Out of 28 patients Placebo Out of 14 patients Total Out of 42 patients How many patients had adverse events?

349,2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) Did any patients have serious adverse events?
350,"An adverse event is called serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or leads to hospitalization."
351,No patients died during the trial.
352,"However, some patients experienced serious adverse events."
353,"In Part 1, 2 patients experienced a serious adverse event - 1 patient in the 150 mg CJM112 group and 1 patient in the placebo group."
354,The serious adverse events were high blood pressure and back pain.
355,Trial doctors did not think that any of the serious adverse events were related to the trial drug.
356,"5 Clinical Trial Results In Part 2, 1 patient experienced 2 serious adverse events."
357,The patient was in the 1350 mg CJM112 group and experienced breathing problems and kidney failure after surgery for another health problem.
358,The trial doctors did not consider either of these serious adverse events to be related to the trial drug.
359,What were the most common non-serious adverse events?
360,The tables below show the most common non-serious adverse events (in at least 2 patients) in this trial.
361,"Most Common Non-Serious Adverse Events in Part 1 Non-Serious Adverse Event CJM112 Total Out of 28 patients Placebo Out of 14 patients Total Out of 42 patients Infection in the nose, throat, and upper airways (upper respiratory tract infection) 3 (10.7%) 1 (7.1%) 4 (9.5%) Increased levels of the protein alanine aminotransferase in the blood (indicating liver problems) 1 (3.6%) 1 (7.1%) 2 (4.8%) Back pain 1 (3.6%) 1 (7.1%) 2 (4.8%) Stomach flu 2 (7.1%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (4.8%) Headache 2 (7.1%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (4.8%) Pain in the mouth or upper throat 1 (3.6%) 1 (7.1%) 2 (4.8%) Itching 1 (3.6%) 1 (7.1%) 2 (4.8%) Toothache 1 (3.6%) 1 (7.1%) 2 (4.8%) Most Common Non-Serious Adverse Events in Part 2 Non-Serious Adverse Event CJM112 Total Out of 42 patients Secukinumab Out of 6 patients Placebo Out of 6 patients Total Out of 54 patients Headache 3 (7.1%) 0 (0%) 1 (16.7%) 4 (7.4%) Back pain 3 (7.1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 3 (5.6%) Itching 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 1 (16.7%) 3 (5.6%) Infection in the nose, throat, and upper airways (upper respiratory tract infection) 1 (2.4%) 0 (0%) 1 (16.7%) 2 (3.7%) Diarrhea 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) Stomach flu from a virus 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) Insomnia 1 (2.4%) 0 (0%) 1 (16.7%) 2 (3.7%) General itching 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) Worsening of psoriasis 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) Sinus congestion 1 (2.4%) 0 (0%) 1 (16.7%) 2 (3.7%) Infection in the nose, throat, and upper airways from a virus (viral upper respiratory tract infection) 2 (4.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (3.7%) 6 Clinical Trial Results For a full list of the adverse events that occurred in this trial, please refer to the full scientific summary of the results available on the Novartis Clinical Trial Results website (www.novctrd.com)."
363,Researchers wanted to know if patients who took higher doses of CJM112 had more CJM112 stay in the blood.
364,"This was true for both Part 1 and Part 2, where the amount of CJM112 in the blood was higher for patients who took more CJM112."
367,"In Part 1, researchers found that the 15 mg, 50 mg, 150 mg, and 450 mg doses of CJM112 helped treat chronic plaque-type psoriasis better than placebo."
368,The dose of 5 mg CJM112 did not help treat chronic plaque-type psoriasis better than placebo.
369,"In Part 2, researchers found that the 75 mg, 250 mg, 750 mg, and 1350 mg total doses of CJM112 helped treat chronic plaque-type psoriasis better than placebo."
370,Researchers found that the 3 higher doses of CJM112 helped treat chronic plaque-type psoriasis similarly to secukinumab.
371,Researchers used different tests to measure the extent and severity of the psoriasis.
372,One test is called the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index or PASI.
373,"It measures thickness, redness, and scaling of the skin, as well as the amount of skin involved in different areas covering the entire body."
374,"The higher the PASI response, the more patients psoriasis symptoms decreased."
375,Another test is called the Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI.
376,"The DLQI is a questionnaire that trial doctors use to ask patients about changes in how they feel, also known as their quality of life, since starting trial medication."
377,"The higher the DLQI response, the more patients quality of life increased."
378,7 Clinical Trial Results The graphs below show the PASI and DLQI results for each group in Part 1 and Part 2.

380,"In Part 2, the total CJM112 dose of 750 mg appeared to provide the best results."
381,How did patients immune systems react to CJM112?
382,Researchers wanted to see if patients immune systems made antibodies against CJM112 in the blood.
383,"If antibodies against CJM112 form, the drug may not work as well, or it may cause an allergic reaction to the drug - both may happen, or nothing may happen."
384,"Some patients in this trial formed antibodies against CJM112, but these antibodies were not linked to any adverse events or how well CJM112 worked in patients."
385,8 Clinical Trial Results Where can I learn more about this trial?
387,It takes many volunteers in many trials all around the world to advance medical science.

402,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the trial drug bimagrumab, also called BYM338."
403,"You and all the other patients helped researchers learn more about whether bimagrumab helps people with sporadic inclusion body myositis, also called sIBM."
404,Novartis sponsored this trial and thinks it is important to share the results of the trial with you and the public.
409,Your trial included 10 patients at 2 trial sites in the United States and lasted for up to 2 years.
410,It ended early because the results from another larger and longer trial with bimagrumab in patients with sIBM showed it did not help patients as much as researchers had expected.
411,"After your trial was stopped, the sponsor reviewed the data collected from you and the other 9 patients and created a report of the results."

414,2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
415,"Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical trials to find out how well it works and how safe it is."
416,"In this trial, researchers were looking for a way to treat sIBM."
417,"This disease causes muscle loss and weakness, especially in the arms and the thighs."
418,sIBM is a disease that gets worse over time.
419,"People with this muscle disease may end up losing their ability to stand up from a chair, walk without walking aids, and pick up things with their hands."
420,Doctors currently do not have a treatment for sIBM.
421,"In this trial, researchers wanted to learn if bimagrumab can increase the strength of the muscle and the muscle mass, which is the amount of muscle in the body."
422,"In doing so, researchers also wanted to know if bimagrumab could help people with sIBM walk farther, move around easier, and function better in their activities of daily life."
423,Bimagrumab is a type of drug called an antibody.
425,Researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of medical conditions.
426,"Bimagrumab blocks the release of a protein found on muscle cells, which is involved in muscle growth."
427,"When this protein is not released, muscle cells are able to grow larger."
428,The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: What medical problems did patients have during the trial?
429,How did bimagrumab affect patients muscles?
430,How much bimagrumab got into the blood?
431,"To answer these questions in this trial, researchers asked for the help of men and women with sIBM."
432,The patients in this trial were 50 to 81 years old.
433,All patients had completed another trial with bimagrumab before starting this trial.
434,"On average, there were about 2 years between when patients finished the first trial and when they started this trial."
436,This trial was an open label trial.
437,"This means that the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, and sponsor staff knew what treatment the patients were getting."
438,All of the patients in this trial got bimagrumab.
440,"Before the trial started, the trial doctors examined you carefully to make sure that you could take part in the trial."
441,This was called the screening visit .
442,"During this visit, the doctors did the following: Checked your heart health Took blood and urine samples Checked your height, weight, temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate Asked about any medicines you were taking Measured your muscle mass Tested your muscle strength and walking ability The trial doctors then checked you and the other patients again 5 days before you got the first dose of bimagrumab."
443,This was called the baseline visit .
444,"During the trial, you got your trial treatment every 4 weeks at the trial site."
445,"You got bimagrumab through an IV line, which means through a needle put into a vein."
446,"You and all the other patients got the same dose of 10 mg/kg of bimagrumab, which means 10 milligrams of bimagrumab for each kilogram of your body weight."
447,Trial doctors measured your muscle mass.
448,Trial doctors also tested your muscle strength and walking ability.
449,"The trial doctors also examined you, asked how you felt, and asked about any medical problems that you had recently."
450,"At some visits, you had your heart checked, and trial doctors also collected blood and urine samples from you."
451,"At the end of the trial, you and the other patients went to the trial site for a final visit."
452,The trial doctors asked you how you felt and if you had any medical problems recently.
453,"They also examined you, checked your heart, and collected blood and urine samples."
454,4 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows how the trial was done.
455,Open-label treatment (10 patients) 10 patients got bimagrumab through a needle into a vein every 4 weeks Up to 2 years Screening visit Up to 28 days Follow-up Patients had a final visit after treatment ended.
456,Baseline visit 5 days before the first treatment dose What were the results of the trial?
458,The results presented here are only for your trial.
459,Researchers usually look at the results of many trials to decide which doses of the drug work best and are safest for patients.
460,You should not make changes to your medications or treatment plan based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
461,What medical problems did patients have?
463,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that patients have during a trial.
464,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or the patients need hospital care."
467,"During a trial, all medical problems are reported and written down, whether or not they are caused by the trial drug."
470,5 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had adverse events?
471,All 10 patients reported at least 1 adverse event during the trial.
472,"The table below shows how many patients had adverse events, serious adverse events, and how many left the trial due to adverse events."
473,Adverse events in this trial Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg (out of 10 patients) How many patients had adverse events?
474,100.0% (10) How many patients had serious adverse events?
475,20.0% (2) How many patients left the trial because of adverse events?
476,30.0% (3) What were the most common serious adverse events?
477,There were 9 serious adverse events.
478,These happened in two different patients.
479,"But, not all the serious adverse events were reported by each patient."
480,The following list is all of the serious adverse events that happened.
481,Fast heart rate Bleeding hemorrhoids Bleeding in the stomach and intestines.
482,Low levels of iron in the blood Low red blood cell count Heart attack Dehydration Cancer in the lungs Cancer in the esophagus.
483,"The esophagus is a muscular tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach 6 Clinical Trial Results Researchers thought just 1 of these serious adverse events, the low level of iron and red blood cells in the blood, was related to the trial drug."
484,They thought the other 8 serious adverse events were not related to the trial drug.
486,The most common adverse events were falls and muscle spasms.
487,A total of 9 out of 10 (90%) patients experienced both of these adverse events.
488,The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened in at least 5 out of 10 (50%) patients in the trial.
489,Other adverse events happened in fewer patients.
490,"Most common adverse events in this trial Adverse event Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg (out of 10 patients) Falls 90.0% (9) Muscle spasms 90.0% (9) Diarrhea 60.0% (6) Acne 50.0% (5) Scrapes and cuts on the skin 50.0% (5) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the website listed at the end of this summary."
492,"To learn how bimagrumab affected patients muscle mass, the trial doctors measured the following: Muscle mass of the thigh using magnetic resonance imaging or MRI Lean body mass, which is the amount of body mass that is not fat or bone Muscle strength of the thigh and hand muscles Physical function, including how far patients could walk in 6 minutes Physical ability using survey questions 7 Clinical Trial Results Overall, researchers found the following: The patients thigh muscle size increased after both 8 weeks and 16 weeks of treatment."
493,"The patients lean body mass was increased after 24 weeks of treatment, but not after 52 weeks of treatment."
494,The patients did not show increased thigh or hand strength compared to when they first started the trial.
495,The patients on average could not walk farther in 6 minutes compared to when they first started the trial.
496,The patients responses to a survey about their physical ability to do daily activities remained the same during the trial.
498,The researchers used blood collected during the trial to measure how much bimagrumab got into the blood after each treatment.
499,Researchers learned that patients had about as much bimagrumab in their blood circulation as expected.
500,How has this trial helped patients and researchers?
501,"Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide whether a drug works, and which dose provides the largest benefit and is safest for patients."
502,This summary shows the main results from this 1 small trial.
503,"Overall, this trial did not show that bimagrumab helped with muscle strength, walking distance, or physical ability."
504,Similar results were also seen in a larger clinical trial with bimagrumab.
505,"So, bimagrumab will not be further tested for the treatment of sIBM."
506,But we thank the participants for their help in testing bimagrumab.
507,"8 Clinical Trial Results Thank you As a clinical trial patient, you belong to a large community of patients around the world."

525,"A clinical trial to test the effects and timing of the trial drug QVM149 for people with asthma Overview of results Trial number: CQVM149B2209 In this clinical trial, researchers studied if a trial drug named QVM149 helped people with asthma breathe easier when taken in the morning or in the evening."
526,What should I know about clinical trials?
527,A clinical trial is a type of research designed to learn more about how our bodies respond to trial drugs or other treatments.
528,Do not use the results of only one clinical trial to make decisions about your health care.
529,Researchers wanted to study: The effects of QVM149 on how easily people could breathe after 14 days of treatment Any differences based on the time of day when people took QVM149 If QVM149 had other effects on people s lungs The safety of QVM149 during the trial Who was in this clinical trial?
530,37 male and female adults with asthma began this clinical trial.
531,What type of clinical trial was this?
532,"This was a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests a trial drug s safety and how well it works in a small number of people."
533,How was safety tested?
534,"Trial doctors asked about and checked for any medical problems, called adverse events, that happened during this clinical trial."
535,People reported adverse events but none were serious.
536,What did researchers learn in this clinical trial?
537,Researchers concluded that QVM149 helped people to breathe easier during this clinical trial.
538,There was no difference in the effects when people took QVM149 in the morning or in the evening.
540,"Novartis, the sponsor of this clinical trial, thanks the people who joined and helped make this clinical trial possible."

546,10 Why was this clinical trial needed?
547,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat asthma.
548,"Asthma is a disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell, making it hard to breathe."
549,"The symptoms of asthma include: Shortness of breath feeling like you can t breathe fast enough or deeply enough to get enough air in your lungs Wheezing a high-pitched whistling sound while breathing Coughing Chest tightness There is currently no cure for asthma, but some medicines can help open the airways in the lungs to help people with asthma breathe easier."
550,Medicines that can open the airways in the lungs are called bronchodilators.
551,"Some people manage their asthma with one bronchodilator, but other people may need more than one bronchodilator for their asthma."
552,QVM149 is a trial drug that researchers are testing.
553,It is a mix of 3 medicines that are approved for doctors to prescribe separately to treat asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
554,"At the time of this clinical trial, QVM149 was not an approved medicine."
555,Researchers need many clinical trials to learn if a drug or other treatment is safe and works well.
556,"This is a summary of the overall results of this clinical trial, not the results for each person in the clinical trial."
557,Do not use only the results of this clinical trial to make health decisions.
558,Always talk to a doctor before making any changes to your treatments.
559,3 Researchers designed this clinical trial to learn if QVM149 could help people with asthma to breathe more easily when taken in the morning or taken in the evening.
560,"In this clinical trial, researchers wanted to learn: The effects of QVM149 on how easily people could breathe after 14 days of treatment Any differences based on the time of day when people took QVM149 If QVM149 had other effects on people s lungs About any medical problems, called adverse events, that people reported Who was in this clinical trial?"
561,"37 adults with asthma, 21 men and 16 women, began this clinical trial."
562,They were 44-years-old on average.
563,Every person in this clinical trial had mild to moderate asthma.
564,They also had: Taken a daily low or medium dose of an inhaled steroid to treat their asthma.
565,An inhaled steroid is a medicine that a person breathes in to lower swelling of the airways.
566,Asthma symptoms that were under control at least 4 weeks before the clinical trial began Asthma that responded to bronchodilators Good overall health People couldn t be in this clinical trial if they had: Problems with bronchodilators similar to QVM149 A severe asthma attack in the last year that needed emergency attention Problems doing repeated breathing tests Trouble breathing during the 14-day period before treatment started when they stopped taking their regular asthma medicines Researchers conducted this clinical trial at 7 locations in 3 countries: 5 locations in Germany 1 location in the Netherlands 1 location in the United Kingdom Each person started the clinical trial at different dates.
567,This trial began in June 2017 and ended in February 2018.
568,3 people did not complete this clinical trial.
569,4 What type of clinical trial was this?
570,"This was a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests the safety of a trial drug and how well it works in a small number of people."
571,"In this trial, researchers used a computer program to randomly assign people to 1 of 6 groups."
572,Each group took QVM149 or a placebo in different orders and at different times of day.
573,A placebo looks like medicine but does not have any medicine in it.
574,Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the actual effects of a trial drug.
575,A placebo is used so that no one in the clinical trial knows when each person got the trial drug or the placebo.
576,Some clinical trials are done this way because knowing what treatment people get can affect the results.
577,Not knowing what treatment people get helps make sure the results are looked at fairly.
578,What happened during this clinical trial?
579,"Before the testing of QVM149 During a 14-day period, trial doctors checked each person s health and asthma to make sure they could be in this clinical trial."
580,"Then, trial doctors asked people in the trial to stop taking certain medicines for 14 days before starting to take either QVM149 or the placebo."
581,During the testing of QVM149 Researchers assigned people to 1 of 6 groups.
582,"Then, they gave each person 2 inhalers, which are devices used to breathe medicine into the lungs."
583,"In this clinical trial, people took the placebo with an inhaler, just like QVM149."
584,"Every person used one inhaler one time in the morning and another inhaler one time in the evening to take the placebo or QVM149, whichever was assigned to their group."
585,"By the end of 3 different 14-day periods, each person took: QVM149 in the morning and the placebo in the evening The placebo in the morning and QVM149 in the evening The placebo in the morning and the placebo in the evening The people took the treatments above in different orders."
586,"After the last dose in each period, trial doctors checked how easily people could breathe over 24 hours."
587,"5 Before starting Period 2 and Period 3, everyone took a break and stopped taking either QVM149 or the placebo."
588,This break between periods lasted 14 to 21 days.
589,This helped remove any effects from the previous treatment period.
590,After the testing of QVM149 Trial doctors last met with people in this clinical trial 1 to 7 days after the last dose in Period 3 to check their overall health and for any adverse events.
591,How researchers designed this trial: What did researchers learn in this clinical trial?
592,"This is a summary of the overall results of this clinical trial, not the individual results of each person."
593,This is a summary of only one clinical trial.
594,Do not use only the results of this clinical trial to make decisions about your health care.
596,6 Researchers concluded that QVM149 helped people breathe easier compared to the placebo.
597,They also learned there was no difference in the effects when people took QVM149 in the morning or in the evening.
598,"To check how easily people could breathe, researchers used a measure called Forced Expiratory Volume during 1 second or FEV1."
599,This is how many liters of air a person can exhale (blow out) with force in 1 second.
600,Swelling narrows the airways in the lungs and lowers the amount of air a person can exhale.
601,A higher FEV1 means that a person can breathe easier.
602,"At the end of each of the 3 periods in this clinical trial, trial doctors measured each person s FEV1 many times over 24 hours."
603,"They compared the average of those measurements after each person took QVM149 in the morning, in the evening, or after they took only the placebo."
604,"When people in this trial took QVM149, their average FEV1 was 0.6 liters higher compared to when they took the placebo, in the morning or evening."
605,Average FEV1 from all periods of this clinical trial What is FEV1?
606,FEV1 is a way to measure how easily a person can breathe.
607,A higher FEV1 means a person can breathe easier.
608,7 What other key results did researchers learn?
609,"In this clinical trial, researchers also learned that: QVM149 helped people breathe easier for a full 24 hours To find out if QVM149 helped people breathe easier for a full 24 hours, trial doctors measured a person s FEV1 24 hours after the last dose of QVM149 in each period."
610,Researchers found that the effects of QVM149 on FEV1 lasted for 24 hours.
611,"QVM149 helped people breathe easier between visits to the trial location To find out if QVM149 helped people breathe easier between visits, trial doctors had each person measure how well they could breathe at home using a peak flow meter 2 times a day."
612,A peak flow meter is a handheld device that measures how fast a person can exhale air.
613,Researchers found that when measured at home: People could exhale more air when they took QVM149 than when they took the placebo The amount of air exhaled was similar when people took QVM149 in the morning or in the evening What medical problems happened during the trial?
614,Medical problems that occur during a clinical trial are called adverse events.
615,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that people report during a clinical trial.
616,These problems may or may not be caused by the clinical trial or the trial drug.
617,Researchers need many trials to know if a drug causes a medical problem.
618,Researchers ask people to report all adverse events during a trial.
619,Trial doctors kept track of the adverse events that people reported.
620,This summary only includes adverse events that were reported: By more than 5% (2 or more) of the people in this clinical trial From the start of the testing of QVM149 to the end of the clinical trial One person left this clinical trial due to an adverse event before the start of Period 3.
621,8 Percent and number of people reporting adverse events during the testing of QVM149 Placebo QVM149 morning dose QVM149 evening dose Percent of people 50% 51% 66% Number of people 18 of 36 people 18 of 35 people 23 of 35 people How many serious adverse events did people report?
622,"An adverse event is called serious when it is life-threatening, requires a hospital stay, can cause disability or permanent damage, or can cause a birth defect."
623,"During this clinical trial, no one reported serious adverse events and no one died."
624,What types of adverse events did people report?
625,Some people reported medical problems or adverse events that were not serious.
626,This section reports the most common adverse events that people said they had during this clinical trial.
627,"From the start of the testing of QVM149 to the end of this clinical trial, people reported the following adverse events (from most to least commonly reported): Headache Common cold Mouth or throat pain Hoarseness Cough Asthma Throat clearing 9 Percent and number of people reporting adverse events by type during the testing of QVM149 10 Researchers concluded QVM149 and the placebo had similar safety results during this trial."
628,How has this clinical trial helped?
629,The results of this clinical trial helped researchers learn more about the effects of QVM149.
630,Researchers learned that QVM149 helped people in this clinical trial breathe easier compared to the placebo.
631,They also learned QVM149 had similar effects when people took it in the morning or in the evening.
632,Researchers also concluded QVM149 and the placebo had similar safety results during this trial.
633,The results presented here are for a single clinical trial.
634,No single clinical trial can give a complete picture of the benefits and risks of a trial drug.
635,The results of many trials are needed to find out which treatments can be used for people with asthma.
636,This summary shows only the main results from this trial.
637,Other clinical trials may provide new information or different results.
638,Where can I learn more about this and future clinical trials?

664,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the trial drug LIK066.
665,"You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how LIK066 works in people with chronic kidney disease, also called CKD."
671,Participants were in this trial for up to about 6 weeks.
672,"But, the entire trial took about 8 months to finish."
673,This is because the participants started and stopped at different times.
674,The trial started in April 2017 and ended in January 2018.
675,The trial included 53 participants from a trial site in the United States.
679,"Before a drug can be approved for patients, researchers do clinical trials to find out about the safety of a drug and how well it works in patients with different diseases."
680,People with CKD have kidneys that do not work properly.
681,"The kidneys filter waste, some medicines, and extra water out of the blood to make urine."
682,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: LIK066 Protocol Number: CLIK066B2202 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results LIK066 lowers the body s ability to absorb glucose from the gut and blocks the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose.
683,"So when people with normally working kidneys take LIK066, they have glucose in the urine."
684,Having glucose in the urine is a sign that LIK066 is working.
685,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to know how much glucose would be found in the urine of people with CKD who took LIK066 compared to participants who have kidneys that work normally."
686,They also wanted to learn more about the safety of LIK066 in people with CKD.
687,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did LIK066 change the amount of glucose in the urine of the participants with CKD?
688,How much LIK066 got into the blood of participants with normally working kidneys and participants with CKD?
691,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of healthy participants and participants with CKD."
692,Some of the participants also had type 2 diabetes.
693,The men and women in this trial were 27 to 78 years old.
694,This was an open-label trial.
695,This means each participant knew what they were taking.
696,The trial staff and sponsor staff also knew what the participant was taking.
698,"In this trial, the researchers compared how LIK066 worked in participants with CKD to how it worked in participants whose kidneys worked normally."
699,There was 1 group of participants with kidneys that worked normally and 4 groups of participants with CKD.
700,Each group of participants with CKD was based on how normally their kidneys worked.
701,"The more severe the participant s CKD, the less normally the participant s kidneys worked."
702,3 Clinical Trial Results There were 4 groups of participants with CKD.
703,"These were based on the severity of the CKD, from least to most severe: Mild Moderate A Moderate B Severe What happened during the trial?"
705,The participants began their stay at the trial site 2 days before treatment started.
706,They gave blood and urine samples.
707,All the participants ate the same breakfast the day before treatment started.
708,Giving all the participants the same breakfast helped to make sure that what each participant ate did not affect their results differently.
709,Participants with CKD joined the trial first.
710,"Then, participants with normally working kidneys joined."
711,"During treatment, each participant took LIK066 in pill form once a day before breakfast."
712,"The dose of LIK066 was measured in milligrams, also called mg. All participants took 50 mg of LIK066 for 7 days."
713,The participants stayed at the trial site for all 7 days of trial treatment.
714,"During this time, all the participants got the same breakfast after taking LIK066."
715,"After the participants took their first dose of LIK066 on the first day of trial treatment, the trial doctors took blood and urine samples at different times over 24 hours."
716,"Throughout the trial, the trial staff: checked the overall health and heart health of the participants took blood and urine samples checked how the participants were feeling and what other medications they were taking 4 Clinical Trial Results After the participants took their last dose of LIK066 on the last day of trial treatment, the trial doctors took more blood and urine samples at different times over 24 hours."
717,Participants with normally working kidneys may have been allowed to leave the trial site the day after the last dose of LIK066.
718,"After treatment, the participants either stayed at the trial site up to 4 days after their last dose or visited the trial site up to 3 more times."
719,"At each visit, the trial doctors: checked the overall health and heart health of the participants took blood and urine samples checked how the participants were feeling and what medications they were taking The chart below shows how the trial was done."
720,During treatment The participants took 50 mg of LIK066 once a day for 7 days before breakfast The participants all got the same breakfast after taking LIK066 After treatment The participants did not take any LIK066 The participants either stayed at the trial site up to 4 more days or visited the trial site up to 3 times Before treatment The participants checked into the trial site The participants all got the same breakfast Up to 28 days 7 days Up to 4 days What were the results of the trial?
721,"This is a summary of the overall results of the trial, not your individual results."
726,5 Clinical Trial Results Did LIK066 change the amount of glucose in the urine of the participants with CKD?
727,"Overall, the worse the participants kidneys worked, the less glucose was found in the participants urine both before and after treatment with LIK066."
728,The researchers wanted to know if the participants with CKD had less glucose in their urine after taking LIK066 compared to participants with normally working kidneys.
729,"To find out, they measured how much glucose was in the participants urine after 7 days of trial treatment."
730,They did this by collecting urine samples over 24 hours on the first and last day of trial treatment.
731,This information helped the researchers to better understand if LIK066 could work in people with CKD.
732,The researchers found that participants in the Moderate B and Severe CKD groups had less glucose in their urine compared to participants with normal working kidneys.
733,"They found slight changes in the Mild and Moderate A groups, but these were too small to know if LIK066 caused the changes."
734,The chart below shows the average change in the amount of glucose in the participants urine after 7 days of treatment.
735,"This amount was measured in grams, also called g. 0 20 60 80 Average change in the amount of glucose in the participants urine 40.5 g decreaseNormal 31.9 g decreaseMild 36.3 g decreaseModerate A 19.9 g decreaseModerate B 5.5 g decreaseSevere Change in the amount of glucose (g) 40 6 Clinical Trial Results How much LIK066 got into the blood of participants with normally working kidneys and participants with CKD?"
736,"Overall, the researchers observed that the average total amount of LIK066 in the participants blood was higher in participants with kidneys that did not work normally."
737,"To answer this question, the trial doctors measured how much LIK066 was in the participants blood on the first and last day of treatment."
738,This helped the researchers to find: the average highest level of LIK066 that got into the participants blood the average amount of time it took LIK066 to reach the highest level in the participants blood the average total amount of LIK066 measured in the participants blood The graphs below show an example of how the amount of a trial drug in the blood can change over time.

750,The average total amount of LIK066 was about 75% higher in the participants in the Severe CKD group compared to the participants with normally working kidneys.
751,There were differences between the participants in the Mild or Moderate A CKD groups compared to participants with normally working kidneys.
752,"But, these differences were too small for the researchers to know if these differences were due to the severity of the participants CKD."
753,The results of 1 participant for Day 7 were not included above because some of the blood samples were taken too late or were not taken.
754,"For more information about measurements of LIK066 in the blood during this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the website noted at the end of this summary."
755,9 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did participants have?
762,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have."
764,All 53 participants are included in these results because they all took at least 1 dose of LIK066.
766,There were a similar number of participants in each treatment group who had adverse events.
767,There was 1 participant each in the Moderate B group and Severe CKD group who had a serious adverse event.
768,There were 2 participants who stopped taking LIK066 because of an adverse event: 1 participant stopped taking LIK066 due to a serious adverse event of the left side of the heart not pumping blood well.
769,1 participant stopped taking LIK066 due to lower than normal blood glucose levels.

816,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the treatment ACZ885, also known as canakinumab."
817,"You helped researchers learn about how ACZ885 works in people with peripheral artery disease who have intermittent claudication, which is pain or discomfort brought on by walking or exercise."
818,"Novartis, the sponsor of this trial, thinks it is important for you to know the results of your trial."
821,"If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor, research nurse, or other team members at your trial site."
822,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: ACZ885 (Canakinumab) Protocol #: CACZ885M2201 Full Trial Title: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety, tolerability and effects on arterial structure and function of ACZ885 in patients with intermittent claudication Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: October 2012 to August 2016 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
823,You were in this trial for up to a little over 1 year.
824,The whole trial took almost 4 years to complete.
825,"The trial included 38 patients from 16 trial sites in Germany, Jordan, and the United States."
826,"Based on an initial review of the data, this trial was stopped early."
827,The trial treatment did not have the results that were expected.
828,"After the trial ended early in August 2016, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
831,"In this trial, researchers were looking for a better way to help patients with a disease related to blood flow that is called peripheral artery disease, also known as PAD."
832,People with PAD often have reduced blood flow due to plaque build up in the arteries in their legs.
833,"Plaque contains fat, cholesterol, and other substances."
834,"This reduced blood flow may cause intermittent claudication , which is discomfort in the leg, buttock, or foot while doing activities like walking."
835,Researchers have found a protein in the body that might be related to the narrowing of arteries.
836,The protein is called IL-1 beta .
837,IL-1 beta can lead to inflammation.
838,"The trial treatment, ACZ885, is a type of antibody that can block IL-1 beta."
840,Researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of conditions.
841,"In this trial, researchers compared ACZ885 to a placebo."
842,A placebo looks like medicine but does not have any real medicine in it.
843,Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the actual effect of a trial treatment.
844,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: Did ACZ885 change how much plaque was in the wall of the main artery in the leg more than the placebo?
845,Did ACZ885 change the amount of 2 different proteins in the blood?
847,"To answer these questions, researchers asked for the help of women and men like you."
848,The patients in this trial were 47 to 79 years old and had PAD with intermittent claudication.
851,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were getting ACZ885 or the placebo."
854,"After the trial was stopped, the research sponsor found out what all the patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
856,Before the trial started: You had tests done to check your overall health to find out if you could join the trial.
857,"Your PAD symptoms were also checked, including looking at how well you could walk and how your blood pressure was in your legs compared to your arms."
858,"You had images taken of the main artery in your leg using a medical imaging test called magnetic resonance imaging , also called an MRI."
859,"During the trial: 18 patients got 150 milligrams , also known as mg, of ACZ885 through a shot given under the skin once a month."
860,20 patients got the placebo through a shot given under the skin once a month.
861,"The treatment you got was decided randomly, using a computer program."
862,"To check your health and PAD symptoms: You had an MRI scan of the main artery in your leg after 3 months, and again after 12 months."
863,"You had your overall health checked, the blood pressure in your legs and arms measured and compared, and how well you could walk checked."
864,You also gave blood and urine samples and answered questions about any other medicines you were taking and how you were feeling.
865,4 Clinical Trial Results You had a final visit 1 month after you got the last shot.
867,Double-blind treatment: 38 Patients 12 months of treatment MRI scan to look at leg artery before treatment and after 3 months of treatment MRI scan to look at leg artery after 12 months of treatment 0 3 6 9 12 18 patients got 150 mg of ACZ885 through a shot under their skin once a month 20 patients got the placebo once a month through a shot under the skin What were the results of the trial?
873,Did ACZ885 change how much plaque was in the wall of the main artery in the leg more than the placebo?
874,"Overall, the difference between the treatments was too small for researchers to know if ACZ885 changed the narrowing of the main artery in the leg more than the placebo."
875,There was no change in the amount of plaque in the small area of the main artery in either group.
876,The researchers found out how much plaque patients had by measuring the average area of the main artery.
877,"The average area was measured in square millimeters , also known as mm2."
878,The researchers found out how much the average area changed by comparing the patients MRIs from before and after treatment.
879,"After 12 months of treatment, patients who got ACZ885 and patients who got placebo had about the same amount of plaque in their main leg artery as before treatment."
881,"Overall, researchers found that the difference between patients in the ACZ885 and placebo groups was too small for researchers to know if 1 treatment changed the amount of proteins more than the other after 12 months of treatment."
882,5 Clinical Trial Results Researchers measured the amount of 2 proteins in the blood.
883,These proteins help researchers get an idea of how much inflammation is found in each patient.
884,They compared the amount of these proteins before and after treatment.
885,These proteins are called: Serum amyloid A : This is also called SAA.
886,C-reactive protein : This is also called CRP.
887,"After 12 months, patients in both treatment groups had about the same amount of SAA and CRP in their blood compared to before treatment."
888,"But, patients who got ACZ885 did have lower CRP levels at earlier points in the trial, after 2, 7, and 10 months of treatment compared to before treatment."
890,A lot of research is needed to know whether a treatment causes a medical problem.
891,"So when new treatments are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that patients have."
893,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the trial treatment.
895,"During the trial, adverse events were collected for all patients whether they got ACZ885 or placebo: 94.7% of all patients in the trial had adverse events."
896,This was 36 out of the 38 patients.
897,52.6% of all patients in the trial had serious adverse events.
898,This was 20 out of the 38 patients.
899,15.8% of all patients in the trial stopped treatment because of adverse events.
900,This was 6 out of the 38 patients.
901,The table below shows how many patients in each treatment group had adverse events.
902,Slightly more patients in the placebo group had adverse events compared to the ACZ885 group.

908,This was 10 out of the 18 patients.
909,50.0% of patients who got the placebo had serious adverse events.
910,This was 10 out of the 20 patients.
911,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or leads to hospitalization."
912,"During a trial, all serious adverse events are reported and written down, whether or not they are caused by the trial drug."
913,There was 1 patient who got ACZ885 who died due to a heart attack.
914,The trial doctors did not think this death was related to getting ACZ885.
915,The serious adverse event that happened most often was reduced blood flow that caused leg pain.
916,This happened in about the same number of patients in both treatment groups.
917,The table below shows the serious adverse events that were reported by at least 2 patients.
918,"Serious adverse events during this trial Serious adverse event ACZ885 150 mg (Out of 18 patients) Placebo (Out of 20 patients) Reduced blood flow that caused leg pain (peripheral arterial occlusive disease) 16.7% (3) 10.0% (2) Heart disease due to clogged arteries (coronary artery disease) 11.1% (2) 5.0% (1) Chest pain not related to the heart (Non-cardiac chest pain) 0.0% (0) 10.0% (2) For more information about serious adverse events in this trial, please refer to the full scientific summary of the results available on the Novartis Clinical Trial Results website (www.novctrd.com)."
919,7 Clinical Trial Results What were the most common non-serious adverse events?
920,"The most common non-serious adverse event was infection of the nose, throat, or airways."
922,The table below shows the most common non-serious adverse events that were reported by at least 10% of all patients in the trial.

945,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug CFZ533.
946,"You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how CFZ533 works in people with rheumatoid arthritis, also called RA."
952,You were in this trial for up to about 9 months.
953,"But, the entire trial took 4 years to finish."
955,The trial started in January 2013 and ended in February 2017.
956,The trial included 76 participants in the United States and Taiwan.
957,The 76 participants included 56 healthy participants and 20 participants with RA.
958,Eight of the healthy participants were in a separate treatment group.
959,These participants were Chinese.
960,The Chinese healthy participants were included to help researchers learn about CFZ533 in an Asian population.
961,The sponsor reviewed the data collected when the trial ended and created a report of the results.
964,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have immune system diseases like RA.
966,This information is important to know before other trials can be done to find out if CFZ533 improves the health of people with immune system diseases like RA.
967,"In people with immune system diseases like RA, the body s immune system mistakenly attacks the tissues in the body, including the joints."
968,This causes inflammation and swelling that damage the joints and other tissues.
969,Researchers think T-cells and B-cells may be involved in this tissue damage.
970,These cells link together when the immune system needs to fight infections.
971,"But in people with RA, these cells link together even when there is no infection."
972,The trial drug CFZ533 may prevent these immune cells from linking together.
973,This may help reduce the symptoms of RA.
974,"Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: CFZ533 Protocol #: CCFZ533X2101 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out what amounts of CFZ533 were safe for participants to take."
975,They also wanted to find out how much CFZ533 got into each participant s blood.
976,"To do this, the researchers compared CFZ533 with a placebo."
977,A placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it.
978,Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the actual effect of a trial drug.
979,The main questions researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: What medical problems did participants have?
980,How much CFZ533 got into the participants blood?
981,Did the participants getting CFZ533 have an unwanted immune system response?
983,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of both healthy participants and participants with RA."
984,The participants in this trial were men and women who were 19 to 65 years old.
985,This was a dose escalation trial.
986,This means that each participant got only 1 dose of the trial treatment.
987,Different groups of participants were given different doses of CFZ533.
988,The researchers looked at the results from each group of participants who were given the same dose before giving the next higher dose to the next group of participants.
989,The first 2 healthy participants got CFZ533 as open-label treatment.
990,This means that each participant knew what treatment they were getting.
991,The trial staff and sponsor staff also knew what treatment each participant was getting.
992,The researchers did this to make sure CFZ533 was safe for participants to take.
993,54 healthy participants and 20 participants with RA got double-blind treatment.
994,"This means that none of the participants, trial doctors, or other trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each participant got."
995,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment the participants are getting can affect the results of the trial.
997,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants got so they could create a report of the trial results."
998,A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant got.
1001,"Before the trial treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure participants could take part in the trial."
1002,Participants gave blood and urine samples.
1003,"The trial doctors also checked the heart health of participants using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG."
1004,Participants got vaccinations if they needed them.
1005,Participants stayed at the trial site the night before treatment started.
1006,3 Clinical Trial Results This trial was done in 2 parts.
1007,Part 1 started first.
1008,"Then, Part 2 began about halfway through Part 1."
1009,Participants were in only 1 part of the trial.
1010,Each participant received 1 dose of trial treatment.
1011,Part 1: Healthy participants got either CFZ533 or a placebo.
1012,Healthy participants got 1 of these through a tube into the vein.
1013,"This is called an intravenous dose, also called IV."
1014,"After different doses were tested in healthy participants, then the participants with RA joined the trial."
1015,Participants with RA got either CFZ533 or a placebo.
1016,Each participant with RA got 1 of these through an IV dose.
1017,Part 2: Healthy participants in this part got either CFZ533 or a placebo.
1018,Healthy participants got 1 of these through a needle under the skin.
1019,"This is called a subcutaneous dose, also called SC."
1020,This helped the researchers learn if a different way of giving CFZ533 affected how much CFZ533 got into the blood.
1021,"For both parts of the trial, each participant received 1 dose of trial treatment."
1022,The dose each participant got was based on which group the participant was assigned to and the participant s body weight.
1023,"Doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram, also called mg/kg."
1024,"Seven different doses of CFZ533 were compared to the placebo in 12 groups: Treatment Type of participant Treatment Number of participants Group 1 Healthy participants 0.03 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 2 Healthy participants 0.1 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 3 Healthy participants 0.3 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 4 Healthy participants 1.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 5 Healthy participants 3.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 6 Healthy participants 3.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by SC 6 Group 7 Healthy participants Placebo by IV or SC 12 Group 8 Chinese healthy participants 3.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 9 Chinese healthy participants Placebo by IV 2 Group 10 Participants with RA 10.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 6 Group 11 Participants with RA 30.0 mg/kg CFZ533 by IV 4 Group 12 Participants with RA Placebo by IV 10 After treatment, the participants stayed at the trial site for another 3 days."
1025,The trial doctors checked the participants overall health and heart health.
1026,The trial doctors also checked how the participants were feeling and what medications they were taking.
1027,The participants visited the trial site another 14 times.
1028,"At each visit, the trial doctors checked the participants overall health."
1029,The participants gave more blood and urine samples.
1030,They may have also gotten another vaccination.
1032,Before treatment Up to 80 days All 76 participants All participants got vaccinations if needed.
1033,"Part 1 48 healthy participants and 20 participants with RA 48 healthy participants got a single, IV dose of CFZ533 or the placebo."
1034,"20 participants with RA got a single, IV dose of CFZ533 or the placebo."
1035,"8 of these participants were the Chinese healthy participants Part 2 8 healthy participants 8 healthy participants got a single, SC dose of CFZ533 or the placebo."
1036,After treatment 168 days All 76 participants All participants visited the trial site another 14 times.
1037,1 day 1 day1 day What were the results of the trial?
1042,You should not make medical decisions based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
1043,Always talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medications or treatment plans.
1044,What medical problems did participants have during the trial?
1054,Adverse events and serious adverse events happened more often in participants with RA compared to the healthy participants.
1055,The healthy participants who got CFZ533 through SC had adverse events as often as healthy participants who got CFZ533 through an IV.
1056,5 Clinical Trial Results None of the healthy participants had serious adverse events.
1057,None of the participants left the trial because of an adverse event.

1064,"Overall, 2.6% of participants had serious adverse events."
1065,This was 2 out of 76 participants.
1066,All serious adverse events reported were in participants with RA.
1067,The doctors did not think these serious adverse events were related to CFZ533.
1068,The serious adverse events in this trial were: Fainting in a participant that got CFZ533 Confusion in a participant that got CFZ533 Inflammation in the large intestine in a participant that got placebo None of the participants died during this trial.
1070,Headache was the most common adverse event in healthy participants.

1076,The researchers wanted to know how much CFZ533 got into the blood of participants.
1077,"Overall, the researchers found that: In general, the highest amount of CFZ533 in the blood was higher for participants who got higher doses of CFZ533."
1078,The time it took for CFZ533 to reach its highest amount in the blood was similar in participants with RA compared to healthy participants.
1079,CFZ533 got into the blood whether given by IV or SC.
1081,"Overall, CFZ533 did not produce an unwanted immune system response in most participants."
1082,The immune system makes proteins called antibodies to find anything that the body does not recognize.
1083,This is how the body knows to fight infections caused by bacteria or viruses.
1084,Sometimes the immune system makes antibodies against medicines.
1085,This might prevent the medicine from working.
1086,The researchers found that 1 healthy participant who got 1mg/kg of CFZ533 through IV had antibodies form against CFZ533.
1087,This did not decrease the amount of CFZ533 in the blood and it did not cause any medical problems in this participant.

1093,This trial studied CFZ533 in humans for the first time.
1094,The results of this trial helped researchers better understand how the body reacts to different doses of CFZ533 and if CFZ533 can be used in future trials.
1095,This research helped doctors understand more about whether CFZ533 could be a treatment for RA and other immune system diseases.
1096,The results from several trials are needed to decide which treatments work best and are safest.
1097,This summary shows only the main results from this one trial.

1114,"Thank you Thank you to the patients who took part in the clinical trial for the drug LFG316, also called tesidolumab."
1115,"The researchers wanted to learn more about how LFG316 works in people with transplant associated microangiopathy, also called TAM."
1116,TAM is a disease that damages the small blood vessels and that can happen when a person gets a stem cell transplant.
1117,Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important to share the results of the trial.
1118,An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the trial results.
1121,The patients were in the trial for up to about 1 year.
1122,The trial started in April 2016 and ended in June 2017.
1123,"Based on the initial results, the researchers could not be sure that LFG316 was helping the patients."
1125,The researchers planned to include 40 patients in this trial.
1126,"But, the trial included only 7 patients in France, Germany, and the United States."
1129,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: LFG316 Protocol #: CLFG316X2202 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
1130,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with TAM.
1131,"Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical trials to find out how safe it is and how well it works."
1132,TAM is a form of microangiopathy that can happen when a person gets a stem cell transplant.
1133,Microangiopathy is a disease that can damage the small blood vessels in the body.
1134,Small blood vessels are lined with cells.
1135,"When these cells are damaged, the blood flows more slowly through the small blood vessels."
1136,This can cause different medical problems.
1137,TAM is a life-threatening disease that is difficult to treat.
1138,"But, patients can sometimes recover on their own, with or without treatment."
1139,Researchers do not completely understand what causes TAM.
1140,"There are standard of care treatments for TAM, but some patients die even after getting these treatments."
1141,A treatment is considered standard of care when the medical community thinks it is the appropriate and widely used treatment for a disease.
1142,Standard of care is also called SOC.
1143,"In patients with TAM, researchers think that an immune system protein may be involved in damaging the small blood vessels."
1144,This leads to serious medical problems.
1145,"LFG316 attaches to this protein, which may stop damage to the small blood vessels seen in TAM."
1146,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out how LFG316 worked in a small number of patients with TAM."
1147,"To find out, the researchers planned to compare the blood test results from patients who got only the SOC with patients who got both the SOC plus LFG316."
1148,Giving all patients the SOC helps doctors make sure that all patients in the trial get a form of treatment.
1149,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: How many patients had a change in their blood counts?
1150,How much LFG316 got into the patients blood?
1151,How many patients died for reasons other than their TAM?
1152,Did TAM symptoms go away in more patients who got LFG316?
1153,What medical problems did the patients have?
1155,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with TAM who had a stem cell transplant."
1156,The patients in this trial were 31 to 66 years old.
1157,"The researchers planned to include children in this trial, but the trial ended early before any children participated."
1159,This means each patient knew what they were getting.
1160,The trial staff and sponsor staff also knew what each patient was getting.
1161,The patients got either the SOC only or the SOC plus LFG316.
1162,The sponsor staff did not know the identity of any of the patients.
1163,A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each patient received.
1166,"Before treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure the patients could take part in the trial."
1167,The patients gave blood and urine samples.
1168,They also had their blood pressure and heart rate checked.
1169,"The trial doctors checked the heart health of the patients using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG."
1170,"If needed, some patients got vaccinations."
1171,"During treatment, patients got either the SOC only or the SOC plus LFG316."
1172,The researchers planned to give patients their assigned treatment for 16 weeks.
1173,"If a patient had no improvement of their TAM during this time, the patient could switch to the other treatment."
1174,Patients who got LFG316 got a dose based on their body weight.
1176,These patients got LFG316 through a needle into their vein.
1177,The patients got either the SOC only or the SOC plus LFG316 once a week.
1178,"Patients who got LFG316 got: 20 mg/kg for the first 3 weeks of treatment 10 mg/kg for another 13 weeks of treatment 4 Clinical Trial Results Depending on their blood test results, they could go back to getting 20 mg/kg until the end of treatment."
1179,"Throughout the trial, the trial doctors: checked the patients blood pressure and heart rate asked the patients at each visit how they were feeling and about any other medicines they were taking took blood and urine samples and checked the patients heart health gave antibiotics to the patients getting LFG316 to prevent infection About 1 week after the last treatment, the patients visited their trial site."
1180,"Then, they visited their trial site 3 more times."
1181,"At these visits, the trial doctors checked the health of the patients."
1182,The trial doctors also asked how the patients were feeling and what medicines they were taking.
1183,The patients gave more blood and urine samples.
1184,The chart below shows how the trial was planned to be done.
1185,"During treatment 3 patients got SOC plus LFG316 2 patients got the SOC only 2 patients switched from SOC only to SOC plus LFG316 After treatment The patients visited their trial site 4 more times Up to 4 weeks Before treatment Trial doctors checked that patients could take part in the trial Patients got vaccinations, if needed 16 weeks 36 weeks The researchers ended the trial early because it was not clear if the patients were getting better."
1186,Only 2 patients completed 16 weeks of treatment.
1187,What were the results of the trial?
1188,This is a summary of the overall results from this trial.
1189,The individual results of each patient might be different and are not in this summary.
1191,Always talk to a doctor before making any treatment changes.
1192,"Based on the initial data, the researchers decided to end the trial early."
1193,"Because the trial ended early, researchers were not able to get the information they needed to answer most of the questions they had about LFG316."
1194,5 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had a change in their blood counts?
1195,The researchers planned to measure the amounts of different types of blood cells in the patients.
1196,This is called a blood count.
1197,Looking at blood counts helps the researchers find out if LFG316 is helping patients with their TAM.
1198,The researchers measured the blood counts throughout the trial.
1199,"Since the researchers ended the trial early, there were not enough patients to get enough data."
1200,"So, the researchers did not compare the 2 treatments."
1202,The researchers wanted to know how much LFG316 got into the patients blood and how long it stayed in the blood.
1203,This information helps the researchers decide when a dose should be given and what dose is safe and effective for patients.
1204,"The researchers found that in the 5 patients who got LFG316 as part of their treatment, LFG316 reached expected levels in the blood."
1205,No other conclusions could be made from the available data because the trial ended early.
1207,The researchers wanted to know how many patients died for reasons other than their disease.
1208,Three patients died during the trial.
1209,These deaths are discussed in the section below.
1210,TAM is a serious and complex disease that can lead to other medical problems.
1211,This made it difficult for the trial doctors to know if these patients died from reasons other than their TAM.
1213,The researchers wanted to know how many patients in each treatment group had their TAM symptoms go away.
1214,The researchers planned to count how many patients had their TAM symptoms go away after 16 weeks of treatment.
1215,"But, the researchers ended the trial early and there were not enough patients to get enough data."
1220,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or the patient needs hospital care."
1225,6 Clinical Trial Results This section is a summary of the adverse events that happened during this trial.
1226,How many patients had serious adverse events?
1227,"In this trial, 6 of the 7 patients had serious adverse events."
1228,This was 85.7% of patients.
1229,These 6 patients had a total of 31 serious adverse events during this trial.
1230,Most of these serious adverse events are common in patients with TAM who have had a transplant.
1231,One patient had 3 serious adverse events that the trial doctors thought were related to the trial drug.
1232,There were 3 patients who died during the trial.
1233,"During treatment, 1 patient who was getting LFG316 died of a serious infection."
1234,The trial doctors thought this death was related to the trial drug.
1235,The other 2 patients died after they added LFG316 as part of their treatment.
1236,The trial doctors did not think that these 2 deaths were related to the trial drug.
1237,How many patients had adverse events?
1238,All the patients in this trial experienced at least 1 adverse event.
1239,Three patients who got LFG316 as part of their treatment stopped taking the trial treatment because of adverse events.
1240,This was 42.9% of all patients.
1241,The table below shows how many patients had adverse events during this trial.
1242,"Adverse events during this trial LFG316 plus SOC (Out of 3 patients) SOC only (Out of 2 patients) SOC first, then LFG316 plus SOC (Out of 2 patients) Total (Out of 7 patients) How many patients in this trial had adverse events?"

1246,Swelling of the lower limbs and tiredness were the most common adverse events during this trial.
1247,The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened in at least 50.0% of patients out of all the treatment groups during the trial.
1248,"There were other adverse events, but these happened in fewer patients."
1249,"Most common adverse events during this trial Adverse event LFG316 plus SOC (Out of 3 patients) SOC only (Out of 2 patients) SOC first, then LFG316 plus SOC (Out of 2 patients) Total (Out of 7 patients) Swelling of the lower limbs 66.7% (2) 100.0% (2) 0.0% (0) 57.1% (4) Tiredness 33.3% (1) 100.0% (2) 50.0% (1) 57.1% (4) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific results summary that can be found on the websites noted at the end of this summary."
1251,The results presented here are from a single trial.
1252,More research is needed to find out which treatments can be used for patients with TAM.
1254,This trial studied LFG316 in a small group of patients with TAM.
1255,"Because the trial ended early, the number of patients in each treatment group was too small to reach any clear conclusion."
1256,This trial could not show that LFG316 changed the blood counts of patients with TAM.
1257,LFG316 will not be further studied for the treatment of TAM.
1258,The information learned in this trial may help researchers to study other possible treatments for TAM.

1285,"You helped researchers learn more about how LFG316 works in people with age-related macular degeneration, also called AMD."
1286,This trial started in January 2012 and ended in June 2015.
1291,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: LFG316 Protocol #: CLFG316A2203 Full Trial Title: A multicenter, randomized, sham-control, proof-of-concept study of intravitreal LFG316 in patients with geographic atrophy associated with age-related macular degeneration Trial Date: January 2012 to June 2015 2 Clinical Trial Results What s happened since the trial ended?"
1292,This trial had 2 parts - Part A and Part B.
1293,"If you participated in Part A, you were in this trial for up to 2 years."
1294,"If you participated in Part B, you were in the trial for about 4 months."
1295,The trial took about 3 years to complete.
1296,The trial included 158 participants from 19 sites in the United States.
1297,"When the trial ended in June 2015, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
1300,"Researchers were looking for a better way to treat age-related macular degeneration, or AMD."
1301,This disease causes vision problems by damaging the part of the inner eye that is needed for detailed vision.
1302,This part of the eye is called the macula .
1303,"Some people may develop an advanced form of AMD called geographic atrophy , also called GA. People with GA have lesions, or damaged areas, that form on the macula."
1304,These lesions may become larger over time.
1305,Researchers have found that people with AMD have higher activity of an immune system protein called C5.
1306,"In this trial, researchers wanted to know if the trial drug LFG316 could block C5."
1307,The trial drug LFG316 is a type of antibody.
1309,"Researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of conditions, including AMD and GA."
1310,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: Did LFG316 move from the eye into the bloodstream?
1311,Did multiple injections of LFG316 help reduce the growth of GA lesions after 12 months of treatment compared to no treatment at all?
1312,Did LFG316 help in other ways?
1315,The participants in this trial were 61 to 90 years old and had AMD with GA lesions.
1317,This trial was sham-controlled .
1318,"This means that some participants got an injection containing LFG316 into one eye, while some participants got a sham injection into one eye."
1319,The sham injection was not a real injection.
1320,Participants who got the sham had an empty syringe without a needle or trial drug placed against his or her eye.
1321,Sham injections are used to make sure that any changes researchers find during the trial did not happen by chance.
1322,"No matter which treatment participants received, the treatment was only given in one eye."
1323,"Participants did not know if they were getting LFG316 or the sham injection, but the trial doctors did."
1327,Participants were enrolled in either Part A or Part B - not both.
1329,"Single-Masked, Sham-Controlled Trial: 158 Participants 44.1% Part A: 150 Participants Part B: 8 Participants 4 Months20 Months 99 participants got LFG316 injections in his or her eye every 4 weeks 51 participants got sham injections in his or her eye every 4 weeks 7 participants got a single LFG316 injection in his or her eye 1 participant got a single sham injection in his or her eye All participants had full check-ups and a physical examination to make sure they could take part in the trial."
1330,"Trial doctors took blood samples and checked participants temperature, blood pressure, as well as their heart health using an electrocardiogram, or EKG."
1331,Trial doctors also performed eye examinations to check participants eye health and vision at each visit.
1332,Part A lasted for about 20 months: Participants were randomly assigned to get LFG316 injections or sham injections.
1333,Participants got either 5 milligrams (mg) LFG316 injections or sham injections every 4 weeks for up to a total of 18 injections.
1334,Participants had a visit 1 month after their last treatment and a final visit 4 months after their last treatment.
1335,"Part B lasted for about 4 months: Participants were randomly assigned to get a single, 10mg injection of LFG316 or a single sham injection."
1336,Participants had a final visit about 12 weeks after the injection.
1342,You should not make therapeutic changes to your treatment based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
1343,Further clinical studies with LFG316 (are/are not) currently planned.
1344,Did LFG316 move from the eye into the rest of the body?
1345,Single injection: Yes.
1346,"After a single injection, a small amount of LFG316 did move into the bloodstream."
1347,It took about 9 days for LFG316 to reach its highest amount in the blood.
1348,This level of LFG316 in the blood is too small to block C5 in the body or affect other organs in the body.
1349,Multiple injections: Yes.
1350,Researchers also measured the levels of LFG316 in the blood after multiple injections of LFG316.
1351,They found that a small amount of LFG316 did move from the eye and was found in the blood within 24 hours after the injection.
1352,The highest amount of LFG316 to collect in the blood happened 24 hours after the first dose.
1356,Researchers measured the size of GA lesions on the macula throughout the trial.
1357,"To measure the size of the lesions, researchers took a picture of the back of the eye and measured the lesion in the picture."
1358,"At Month 12 of Part A, participants in the LFG316 group had an average GA lesion growth of 1.95 square millimeters (mm2) compared to their lesion size before the trial started."
1359,Participants in the sham group had an average GA lesion growth of 1.58 mm2 compared to before the trial started.
1360,"Overall, the results did not show that one treatment was better than the other."
1361,The 23.3% difference seen between the treatment groups could have been due to chance.
1362,The results did not show that one treatment was better than the other.
1363,The figure below shows the average change in GA lesion size from before treatment to Month 12.
1364,Change in GA Lesion Size from Before Treatment to Month 12 LFG316 Injection Sham Injection C h an g e in G A L es io n S iz e (m m 2 ) 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 1.95 1.58 5 Clinical Trial Results Did LFG316 help in other ways?
1365,Researchers also wanted to know if the size of lesions changed at 6 and 18 months following multiple doses of LFG316.
1366,They found that LFG316 did not reduce growth of the GA lesions at those time points.
1368,The differences seen could have been due to chance.
1369,"Growth of GA Lesions 6 Months After Treatment 18 Months After Treatment LFG316 Injections 0.99 mm2 2.78 mm2 Sham Injections 0.88 mm2 2.03 mm2 Since people with AMD have vision problems, researchers used an eye chart to measure participants vision at different time points in the trial."
1370,They found that LFG316-treated participants were able to read slightly more letters than sham-treated participants.
1371,Number of Letters Participants Could Read on the Eye Chart with Treated Eye 6 Months After Treatment 12 Months After Treatment 18 Months After Treatment LFG316 Injections 48.4 letters 47.5 letters 44.7 letters Sham Injections 42.5 letters 43.0 letters 43.8 letters Researchers also measured the levels of C5 in the blood after participants got multiple injections of LFG316.
1372,They found that neither LFG316-treated nor sham-treated participants had a change in their C5 levels throughout the trial.
1377,An adverse event is any sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
1378,How many participants had adverse events during the trial?
1379,The table on the next page shows how many participants had adverse events that were related to the eye and how many had adverse events that were not related to the eye.
1380,"6 Clinical Trial Results Adverse Events in this Trial Part A Part B LFG316 (5 mg) Out of 99 participants Sham Out of 51 participants Total Out of 150 participants LFG316 (10 mg) Out of 7 participants Sham Out of 1 participant Total Out of 8 participants Related to the eye 83 (83.8%) 35 (68.6%) 118 (78.7%) 3 (42.9%) 1 (100.0%) 4 (50.0%) Not related to the eye 88 (88.9%) 37 (72.5%) 125 (83.3%) 1 (14.3%) 1 (100.0%) 2 (25.0%) In Part A, 83 participants treated with LFG316 had adverse events related to the eye."
1381,Only 8 of those participants had 9 adverse events that the study doctors thought were related to the injection procedure and the presence of drug particles in the eye and not due to the effects of LFG316 itself.
1382,"The 9 adverse events were: 2 cases of increased pressure in the eye Worsening of increased eye pressure Black spots in vision Eye floaters Droplets of silicone in the gel that fills the back of the eye Swelling of the colored part of the eye General swelling of the middle layer of the eye Brightness in vision For the adverse events not related to the eye, the trial doctors did not think these adverse events were related to treatment with LFG316."
1383,"In Part A, 6 participants (4.0%) left the trial because of adverse events."
1384,"In Part B, 1 participant (12.5%) left the trial because of adverse events."
1385,None of the adverse events (related to the eye or not) were thought to be related to treatment with LFG316.
1386,Did any participants have serious adverse events?
1388,"In Part A, 38 out of 150 participants (25.3%) experienced serious adverse events."

1415,The Center for Information & Study on Clinical Research Participation (CISCRP) is a non- profit organization focused on educating and informing the public about clinical research participation.
1420,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug VAY736, also called ianalumab."
1421,"You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how VAY736 works in people with primary Sj gren s syndrome, also called PSS."
1427,You were in this trial for up to 3 years.
1428,"But, the entire trial lasted about 3.5 years."
1430,The trial started in May 2014 and ended in February 2018.
1431,The trial included 27 participants from a trial site in Germany.
1435,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have PSS.
1436,"Before a drug can be approved for patients, researchers do clinical trials to find out how safe it is and how well it works."
1437,The information collected from many clinical trials is needed to find out if VAY736 improves the health of people with PSS.
1438,"In people with PSS, the body s immune system is overactive."
1439,"When that happens, the immune system attacks the body, including the glands that make fluids like tears, saliva, or sweat."
1440,"People with PSS have dryness of the mouth, eyes, and other areas."
1441,They also have pain and tiredness that severely affect their daily lives.
1442,"Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: VAY736 (ianalumab) Protocol Number: CVAY736X2201 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if VAY736 works in a small number of participants with PSS."
1443,They also wanted to find out about the safety of VAY736 in participants with PSS.
1444,"To do this, the researchers compared VAY736 with a placebo."
1447,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did VAY736 make the participants PSS symptoms less severe?
1448,Did the participants feel that other aspects of their PSS changed after getting VAY736?
1449,Did the trial doctors think the participants overall health changed after taking VAY736?
1450,How long and at what level was VAY736 in the participants blood?
1453,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with PSS."
1454,The participants in this trial were 25 to 70 years old.
1456,This means that each participant got only 1 dose of the trial drug.
1457,Different groups of participants were given different doses of VAY736.
1458,The researchers checked to make sure that the dose was safe before giving the next higher dose to the next group of participants.
1459,This trial was done in 2 time periods.
1460,The first 24 weeks of the trial was the double-blind period.
1461,"This means none of the participants, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what trial drug each participant got."
1462,Some trials are done this way because knowing what trial drug the participants are getting can affect the results of the trial.
1464,A computer program was used to randomly assign the trial drug each participant got during the double-blind period.
1465,Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each trial drug is done as fairly as possible.
1466,"After 24 weeks, the participants, trial staff, and sponsor staff found out what treatment each participant got during the double-blind period."
1467,The participants who got the placebo during the double-blind period were given the choice to get a single dose of VAY736.
1468,The rest of this trial was open-label .
1469,"This means the participants, trial staff, and sponsor staff knew the treatment each participant received."
1470,All participants stayed in the open-label period until their B cell levels returned to normal.
1471,"3 Clinical Trial Results When the trial ended, the sponsor created a report of the trial results."
1474,"Before treatment started, the participants visited the trial site 2 times."
1475,The trial doctors did tests and checked the health of the participants to make sure they could take part in the trial.
1476,"During the double-blind period, the participants got a single dose of drug through a needle into a vein."
1477,"This is called an intravenous dose, also called an IV dose."
1478,"The dose each participant got was measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight, also called mg/kg."
1479,"The participants got 1 of 3 treatments: 6 participants got 3 mg/kg of VAY736 12 participants got 10 mg/kg of VAY736 9 participants got the placebo After getting the single dose, the participants visited the trial site at least 10 times over 24 weeks."
1480,"Throughout the entire trial, the trial doctors took blood, urine, and saliva samples and checked the participants PSS symptoms and overall health."
1481,"At some of these visits, the participants filled out questionnaires about their PSS symptoms and had their B cell levels checked."
1482,"After the first 24 weeks of the trial, participants who got the placebo in the double-blind period had the choice to restart the trial, and get a single 10 mg/kg dose of VAY736."
1483,"After the double-blind period finished: 6 participants out of 18 who got any dose of VAY736 in the double-blind period finished the trial within 24 weeks 12 participants out of 18 who got any dose of VAY736 in the double-blind period stayed in the trial because their B cell levels did not return to normal after 24 weeks Of the 9 participants who got the placebo: 4 participants finished the trial after the double-blind period ended 5 participants chose to get a single, open-label dose of 10 mg/kg VAY736 The 5 participants who got open-label VAY736 kept visiting the trial site because their B cells did not return to normal within 24 weeks of getting VAY736."
1484,"4 Clinical Trial Results After treatment, the trial doctors took more blood, urine, and saliva samples and checked the participants PSS symptoms and overall health."
1485,The participants filled out questionnaires about their primary Sj gren s syndrome symptoms and had their B cell levels checked.
1486,The graphic below shows how the trial was done.
1487,"24 weeks Double-blind period 27 participants Open-label treatment Open-label period After treatment The participants did not get any VAY736 The participants stayed in the trial until the B cell levels in their blood returned to normal Once B cell levels returned to normal, the participants visited the trial site 1 more time 6 participants got 3 mg/kg 12 participants got 10 mg/kg 9 participants 27 participants 5 participants got 10 mg/kg VAY736 24 weeks Placebo VAY736 What were the results of the trial?"
1493,"For more information about the results of this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the website noted at the end of this summary."
1494,Did VAY736 make the participants PSS symptoms less severe?
1495,"After 12 weeks, there were slight reductions in the participants PSS symptoms in all treatment groups."
1496,The researchers were more interested in the difference between VAY736 and the placebo than in the difference between the 2 VAY736 doses.
1497,"So, the researchers combined the 2 VAY736 treatment groups into 1 group when looking at the results."
1498,There was a slightly larger reduction in PSS symptoms for the participants who got VAY736 compared to the participants who got the placebo.
1499,"But, the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if they were caused by the trial drug."
1500,5 Clinical Trial Results The researchers wanted to know if VAY736 made the participants PSS symptoms less severe.
1501,"To find out, the trial doctors measured how severe the participants PSS symptoms were before getting the trial drug, and 12 weeks after getting the trial drug."
1502,"They did this using the EULAR Sj gren s Syndrome Disease Activity Index, also called the ESSDAI."
1503,Lower scores meant the PSS symptoms were less severe.
1504,The researchers looked at the data after 12 weeks to decide whether or not to continue the trial.
1505,"The researchers learned that after 12 weeks, on average: The PSS symptoms in the participants who got VAY736 decreased by 2.3 points."
1506,The PSS symptoms in the participants who got the placebo decreased by 0.9 points.
1508,How much the patients PSS symptoms decreased Total VAY736 Placebo 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0 C ha ng e in p oi nt s 2.3 0.9 Did the participants feel that other aspects of their PSS changed after getting VAY736?
1509,"Overall, the participants in all treatment groups felt that their PSS symptoms changed after 12 weeks."
1510,"But, some of the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if these differences were caused by the trial drug."
1511,The researchers wanted to know if VAY736 changed the participants PSS symptoms throughout the trial.
1512,"To find out, they used 4 questionnaires."
1513,6 Clinical Trial Results The table below shows what these questionnaires are.
1514,"Name Description What the score shows EULAR Sj gren s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (also called the ESSPRI) Measured how severe the participants main PSS symptoms of pain, dryness, and tiredness were during the trial A low score in the ESSPRI meant the participants PSS symptoms were less severe Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (also called the MFI) Measured the participants tiredness A low score in the MFI meant the participants were less tired Patient Global Assessment version of the Visual Analog Scale (also called the VAS) Measured the participants overall condition A low score in the Patient Global Assessment VAS meant the participant had a healthier overall condition 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (also called the SF-36) Measured the participants physical, emotional, and social well-being A high score in the SF-36 meant the participants had a healthier well-being Overall, the scores showed that the participants who got VAY736 or the placebo had fewer PSS symptoms after getting the study treatment."
1515,Some of these effects lasted longer than 12 weeks for participants who got 10 mg/kg of VAY736.
1516,The participants who got 10 mg/kg of VAY736 generally had larger differences than participants who got 3 mg/kg compared to the placebo.
1517,"But, the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if these differences were caused by the trial drug."
1518,Did the trial doctors think the participants overall health changed after getting VAY736?
1520,The trial doctors thought that the participants overall health changed after getting VAY736.
1521,"To answer this question, the trial doctors filled out the doctor s version of the VAS before each participant got the trial drug, and 12 weeks after they got the trial drug."
1522,A decrease in the participants VAS scores after 12 weeks showed that the participants overall condition was getting healthier.
1523,The researchers compared the results from the participants who got VAY736 with the results from the participants who got the placebo.
1524,They found that there was a bigger decrease in the trial doctors VAS scores for the participants who got VAY736 compared with the VAS scores for the participants who got the placebo.
1525,7 Clinical Trial Results How long and at what level was VAY736 in the participants blood?
1526,"To answer this question, the trial doctors took blood samples from the participants after they got a single dose of VAY736."
1527,The trial doctors did this over the course of the entire trial.
1528,The researchers wanted to know about how long VAY736 was in the participants blood.
1529,"The researchers found that: For all treatments, it took about 2 hours for VAY736 to reach its highest level in the blood."
1530,This was at the end of the infusion.
1531,The researchers also wanted to know about how much VAY736 got into the participants blood.
1532,"The researchers found that: Overall, higher amounts of VAY736 were in the blood of participants that got 10 mg/kg compared to those who got 3 mg/kg."
1536,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or the participant needs hospital care."
1537,These adverse events may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
1538,A lot of research is needed to know whether a trial drug causes an adverse event.
1540,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all adverse events that participants have."
1541,This section is a summary of the adverse events that happened during both parts of this trial.
1543,Most of the participants in the trial had at least 1 adverse event.
1544,Most of the adverse events happened within the first 24 hours of getting the trial drug.
1545,None of the participants in the trial stopped getting the trial drug because of adverse events.

1554,The serious adverse events that happened during this trial were: Fluid-filled sac in the ovary Groin hernia Inflammation of the appendix Jaw fracture Long-term inflammation of the large intestine None of the participants died during this trial.
1556,"The most common adverse event that happened in the participants during the double-blind period was a reaction from getting the trial drug through an IV, also called an infusion- related reaction."
1557,This adverse event happened in 83.3% of the participants who got any dose of VAY736.
1558,This was 15 out of 18 participants.
1559,This adverse event also happened in 11.1% of the participants who got the placebo.

1569,How has this trial helped participants and researchers?
1570,The results of this trial helped researchers better understand if VAY736 works in participants with PSS.
1571,The results from many trials are needed to find out which treatments can be used for people with PSS.
1573,This was the first time that participants with PSS got VAY736.
1574,This trial was done in a small number of participants.
1576,"If other trials with VAY736 in participants with PSS are planned, you will be able to find them on the websites listed below."

1600,"Thank you to the participants who took part in the clinical trial CAIN457AUS02 (VIP-S) for the drug secukinumab, also called AIN457."
1601,All of the participants helped researchers learn more about how secukinumab affects inflammation in patients who have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
1602,"Plaque psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, swollen scaly patches to form on the skin."
1603,Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important to share the results of the trial with the participants and the public.
1605,We hope it helps the participants understand their important role in medical research.
1608,The participants were in the trial for about 1 year.
1609,But the entire trial took 2 years to finish because the participants entered the trial and started treatment at different times.
1610,The trial started in February 2016 and ended in February 2018.
1611,The trial included 91 participants and was conducted only in the United States.
1614,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: Secukinumab Protocol Number: CAIN457AUS02 (VIP-S) Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
1615,"Inflammation is the normal reaction of the body in response to injuries or things from outside the body, like infections."
1616,"People who have psoriasis have a response that causes too much inflammation, which may affect healthy tissue."
1617,"This inflammation can cause red, scaly patches called plaques to form on the skin."
1618,"Inflammation can also happen in other parts of the body, including veins and arteries."
1619,Researchers do not know what causes this inflammation.
1620,"Long-term inflammation can also cause other health problems, like heart and blood vessel problems."
1621,Secukinumab is used in some countries to treat patients who have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
1622,Secukinumab helps control the part of the immune system that leads to inflammation and the growth of skin plaques.
1623,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out more about how secukinumab affects inflammation in the aorta of participants who have plaque psoriasis."
1624,The aorta is the biggest vessel in the body and carries blood away from the heart.
1625,"Inflammation in the aorta has been linked with a higher risk of medical problems, like heart attacks."
1626,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did secukinumab reduce inflammation in the aorta?
1627,How did secukinumab affect other measures of heart and blood vessel disease risk?
1629,"To do this, the researchers compared secukinumab with a placebo."
1630,"A placebo looks like the trial drug, but does not have any medicine in it."
1633,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women who had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that could not be controlled with other treatments."
1634,The participants in this trial were between 22 and 83 years old.
1635,"This trial was done in 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2."
1636,Part 2 happened after Part 1 had ended.
1637,Part 1 Part 1 was double-blind .
1638,"This means that none of the participants, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each participant got during this part."
1639,During Part 1: 46 participants got secukinumab 45 participants got the placebo Both secukinumab and the placebo were given as injections through a needle under the skin.
1640,A computer program was used to randomly assign the treatment each participant got during this part.
1642,Part 2 Part 2 was open-label .
1643,"This means the participants, trial staff, and sponsor staff knew what treatment each participant got during this part."
1644,"During Part 2, all the participants got secukinumab."
1645,"After the entire trial ended, the participants learned whether they got secukinumab or the placebo during Part 1."
1646,4 Clinical Trial Results What happened during the trial?
1647,"Before the treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure the participants could take part in the trial."
1648,This part of the trial took up to 4 weeks.
1649,"During this time, the participants: had a physical exam gave blood and urine samples completed surveys told the trial doctors about any medical problems they had and what other medications they were taking stopped taking certain medications had a picture taken of their aorta To take a picture of each participant s aorta, the trial doctors used a scan called a positron emission tomography with computed tomography scan, also called a PET/CT scan."
1650,"After the trial doctors finished these tests, the participants learned if they could participate in the trial."
1651,"If they could participate, they continued to Part 1 of the trial."
1652,"Throughout and at the end of the trial, the doctors continued checking participants health by performing tests and asking them how they were feeling."
1653,5 Clinical Trial Results The figures below show how the trial was done.
1654,"5 weeks Part 1 Double-blind treatment The participants got secukinumab or the placebo once a week for the rst 5 weeks During this time, the participants did not get trial treatment The doctors checked the health of the participants The participants got 1 dose of their prior treatment, either secukinumab or placebo 12 weeks 3 weeks 1 week During this time, the participants did not get trial treatment The doctors checked the health of the participants to make sure they could join Part 2 3 weeks 4 weeks Part 2 Open-label treatment The participants who got the placebo in Part 1 got secukinumab once a week for 4 weeks The participants who got secukinumab in Part 1 got secukinumab once in the rst week."
1655,"Then, they got the placebo once a week for the next 3 weeks 36 weeks The participants got secukinumab once every 4 weeks 6 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?"
1656,This is a summary of the overall results of this trial.
1657,The individual results of each participant might be different and are not in this summary.
1659,Medical decisions should not be made based on the results of a single trial without first talking to a doctor.
1660,Always talk to a doctor before making any changes to medications or treatment plans.
1661,Did secukinumab reduce inflammation in the aorta?
1663,"Overall, secukinumab did not reduce inflammation in the aorta."
1664,"To answer this question, the trial doctors looked at the PET/CT scans done at the start of the trial."
1665,"Then, they looked at the PET/CT scans done at the end of Part 1, which lasted 12 weeks."
1666,"Before each PET/CT scan, the trial doctors injected the participants with a small dose of a radioactive material called radiotracer."
1667,"This radiotracer was not considered to be harmful and helped the doctors see certain organs and tissues, such as the aorta and veins."
1668,The doctors looked at how much of the radiotracer was in the aorta and compared it to how much was in the blood in the veins.
1669,"This is known as the target to background ratio , also called the TBR."
1670,A higher TBR means there is a high amount of inflammation in the aorta.
1671,"At the end of Part 1, the researchers measured the change in the TBR in: 43 of the 46 participants who got secukinumab 42 of the 45 participants who got the placebo The researchers were not able to study the TBR results for 3 participants in both treatment groups."
1672,This was because these 6 participants left the trial before the researchers could study the results.
1673,The researchers estimated that the average TBR score increased by 0.017 in the secukinumab group and increased by 0.070 in the placebo group.
1674,The difference between the groups was too small for researchers to know if secukinumab reduced inflammation in the aorta compared to the placebo.
1675,7 Clinical Trial Results How did secukinumab affect other measures of heart and blood vessel disease risk?
1676,"The researchers wanted to find out if secukinumab affected cholesterol, blood sugar, and other proteins in the blood."
1677,"These substances can show if a person is at risk for medical problems like heart disease, diabetes, and strokes."
1678,They measured these substances before the participants started treatment and at the end of Part 1.
1679,The researchers were only able to study the below results for 40 of the 46 participants who got secukinumab and 41 of the 45 participants who got the placebo.
1680,This was because some of the participants left the trial before the researchers could study the below results.
1681,"For most of these substances, the researchers did not see differences between the participants who got secukinumab and the participants who got the placebo."
1682,But there were differences between the 2 groups in measures of cholesterol.
1683,Cholesterol plays an important part in making sure that the body works properly.
1684,But there are different types of cholesterol.
1685,"One type is low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also called LDL cholesterol."
1686,LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol and can clog arteries and blood vessels.
1687,"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also called HDL cholesterol, is good cholesterol."
1688,It helps remove bad cholesterol from the blood.
1689,"The researchers measured the participants LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol in milligrams per deciliter , also called mg/dL."
1690,They found that LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol increased slightly in the participants who got secukinumab and decreased in the participants who got the placebo.
1691,After 12 weeks of treatment: LDL cholesterol: went up by an average of 10.0 mg/dL in the participants who got secukinumab went down by an average of 6.3 mg/dL in the participants who got the placebo HDL cholesterol: went down by an average of 0.8 mg/dL in the participants who got secukinumab went down by an average of 1.1 mg/dL in the participants who got the placebo 8 Clinical Trial Results Total cholesterol: went up by an average of 10.6 mg/dL in the participants who got secukinumab went down by an average of 8.5 mg/dL in the participants who got the placebo The researchers found that these differences in cholesterol did not cause the participants to have medical problems.
1692,These differences did not affect the other trial results.
1700,"So when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have."
1701,This section is a summary of the adverse events that happened during Part 1 and during the trial overall.
1702,The overall trial lasted about 52 weeks.
1704,"During Part 1, more participants who got secukinumab had adverse events compared to participants who got the placebo."
1705,More participants who got secukinumab for the entire trial had adverse events compared to participants who got the placebo during Part 1 and then secukinumab during Part 2.
1706,9 Clinical Trial Results The table below shows how many participants had adverse events during all 52 weeks of the trial.

1720,This was 9 out of 46 participants.
1721,15.6% of participants who got the placebo in Part 1 and secukinumab in Part 2.
1722,This was 7 out of 45 participants.
1723,11 Clinical Trial Results The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened during all 52 weeks of the trial.
1724,"Most common adverse events during the trial Secukinumab (Part 1) and secukinumab (Part 2) (Out of 46 participants) Placebo (Part 1) and secukinumab (Part 2) (Out of 45 participants) Total (Out of 91 participants) Common cold 19.6% (9) 15.6% (7) 17.6% (16) Infection in the nose and throat, often caused by a virus 13.0% (6) 8.9% (4) 11.0% (10) Joint pain 10.9% (5) 6.7% (3) 8.8% (8) Cough 2.2% (1) 8.9% (4) 5.5% (5) Diarrhea 6.5% (3) 4.4% (2) 5.5% (5) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the websites noted at the end of this summary."
1726,The information described above helped the researchers better understand how secukinumab might help reduce inflammation in the aorta in participants who have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
1727,"In this trial, secukinumab did not help reduce inflammation in the aorta."
1728,The researchers also wanted to understand if secukinumab affected the risk of heart and blood vessel diseases in the participants.
1729,"Overall, the researchers did not find a difference in heart and blood vessel disease risk between secukinumab and the placebo."
1730,"But, the researchers did find that LDL and total cholesterol increased slightly in the participants who got secukinumab and decreased in the participants who got the placebo."

1754,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug QBW251.
1755,"You and all of the patients helped researchers learn more about how QBW251 works in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD."
1757,"An independent, non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the trial results for you."
1761,You were in this trial for about 3 months.
1762,"But, the entire trial took almost 2 years to finish."
1763,This is because patients started and stopped at different times.
1764,The trial started in April 2015 and ended in January 2017.
1765,The trial included 92 patients from 16 trial sites in Poland and the United States.
1769,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat COPD in people who smoke or used to smoke for at least 10 years.
1770,"Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do many clinical trials to find out how well it works and how safe it is."
1771,This information is important to know before other trials can be done that help find out if QBW251 improves the health of people with COPD.
1772,"Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: QBW251 Protocol: CQBW251X2201 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if QBW251 works in a small number of patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis."
1773,Patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis have inflammation and extra mucus that builds up and traps air in the airways of their lungs.
1774,This trapped air cannot be breathed out.
1775,This makes it harder to breathe and can damage the lungs over time.
1776,Most people who develop COPD are current or former smokers.
1777,Researchers think the mucus caused by COPD may be harder to clear out of the lungs because of a protein that does not work well.
1778,"The protein is called cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor, also called CFTR."
1779,Researchers think cigarette smoke causes this problem with CFTR.
1780,QBW251 may help CFTR work better and reduce the amount of mucus built up in the lungs so patients can breathe easier.
1781,The researchers compared QBW251 to a placebo.
1784,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did QBW251 help the patients lungs work more evenly?
1785,Did QBW251 help the patients lungs in other ways?
1786,How much QBW251 got into the blood?
1787,What medical problems did the patients have during the trial?
1789,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of women and men like you."
1790,The patients in this trial were 46 to 75 years old.
1791,They were all current smokers or former smokers with COPD and chronic bronchitis.
1793,"This means none of the patients, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each patient took."
1794,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment the patients are taking can affect the results of the trial.
1796,A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each patient took.
1800,"Before the trial treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure you could take part in the trial."
1801,This lasted up to 4 weeks.
1802,"Then, you took a placebo twice a day for 2 weeks."
1803,This part of the trial was single-blind .
1804,"This means that you and the other patients did not know you were taking the placebo, but the trial doctors did."
1805,The trial doctors may have asked you to stop taking certain medicines.
1806,This part of the trial helped the researchers make sure any effects they saw during the treatment part of the trial were due to the trial drug and not due to other reasons.
1807,"During the trial: 64 patients took QBW251 twice a day for 4 weeks 28 patients took the placebo twice a day for 4 weeks All patients took pills of QBW251 or the placebo by mouth All patients visited the trial site about 8 times The planned dose of QBW251 was 450 milligrams, also called mg."
1808,"Shortly after the trial started, the researchers learned from other QBW251 trials that a lower dose can be used."
1809,"So, the researchers lowered the dose from 450 mg to 300 mg. 2 patients took 450 mg of QBW251 62 patients took 300 mg of QBW251 To check your overall health and your lungs, the trial staff: checked your heart health and your COPD symptoms before and after taking the trial treatment checked how well your lungs were working took blood, saliva, and urine samples asked questions about how you felt and any other medicines you were taking There was a follow-up period that lasted 4 weeks."
1810,All the patients took a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks.
1811,"This way, the researchers would know if any long term effects they saw were due to the trial drug and not due to other reasons."
1812,"During the follow-up period, the trial staff: checked your COPD symptoms and how well your lungs were working checked how you were feeling and what medicines you were taking 4 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows how the trial was done."
1813,During trial Visits 3-7 2 patients took 450 mg of QBW251 twice a day 62 patients took 300 mg of QBW251 twice a day 28 patients took the placebo twice a day Follow-up Visit 8 Patients took the placebo twice a day for 4 weeks Up to 6 weeks Before trial Visits 1-2 Trial staff took up to 4 weeks to make sure patients could join the trial Patients took the placebo twice a day for 2 weeks 4 weeks 4 weeks What were the results of the trial?
1819,The results for some patients are not included in the results below.
1820,"This is because: some patients did not complete 28 days of treatment for some patients, too much time passed between their last dose and their visit on Day 29 Did QBW251 help the patients lungs work more evenly?"
1822,QBW251 did not help the patients lungs work more evenly.
1823,The researchers used a test that measured how evenly air got in and out of the lungs.
1824,The test is called the lung clearance index.
1825,The test was done both before the patients took the first dose and 28 days after the patients started treatment.
1826,Each patient was given a score based on this test.
1827,Lower scores meant the patients lungs worked more evenly.
1828,The difference between the patients who took QBW251 and the patients who took the placebo was too small for the researchers to know if QBW251 helped patients lungs work more evenly than the placebo.
1829,The difference seen could have been due to chance.
1830,"5 Clinical Trial Results After 28 days of treatment, the researchers found that: Patients who took QBW251 had an average decrease in points of 0.03."
1831,Patients who took the placebo had an average decrease in points of 0.16.
1832,"Overall, the researchers found that the lungs of the patients who took QBW251 did not work more evenly after 28 days of treatment compared to patients who took the placebo."
1833,The figure below shows the changes in how evenly air got in and out of the lungs after 28 days of treatment.
1834,1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.03 0.16 QBW251 Average change in how evenly air got in and out of lungs C ha ng e in p oi nt s Placebo 0.4 Patients lungs worked less evenly Patients lungs worked more evenly Did QBW251 help the patients lungs in other ways?
1835,"During the treatment period, the researchers learned if QBW251 helped patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis more than the placebo did."
1836,The researchers measured 5 main things after 28 days of treatment to learn: 1. how much air the patients breathed out in 1 second 2. the total amount of air the patients could breathe out 3. the total amount of air the patients lungs could hold 4. how much air got trapped in the lungs after the patients breathed out 5. how well the patients lungs moved a gas called carbon monoxide from the air into the blood 6 Clinical Trial Results 1.
1837,How much air the patients breathed out in 1 second The researchers found that QBW251 increased how much air the patients could breathe out in 1 second.
1838,"Before and after treatment, the researchers measured how much air the patients could breathe out in 1 second."
1839,"If the average change in this amount had increased after 28 days of treatment, this meant that the patients could breathe out more air in 1 second."
1840,"This difference was measured in liters, also called L. The researchers tested this before and after patients used an inhaler to make sure the changes were due to the trial drug."
1841,The researchers found that: Average change in the amount of air patients breathed out in 1 second QBW251 (51 patients) Placebo (23 patients) Before the inhaler 0.04 L -0.02 L QBW251 (51 patients) Placebo (24 patients) After the inhaler 0.05 L -0.02 L 2.
1842,The total amount of air the patients could breathe out The researchers found that QBW251 increased the total amount of air that the patients could breathe out.
1843,"Before and after treatment, the researchers measured how much air the patients could breathe out after taking a deep breath."
1844,"If the average change in this amount had increased after 28 days of treatment, this meant that the patients could breathe out more air."
1845,The researchers also tested this before and after the patients used an inhaler to make sure the changes were due to the trial drug.
1846,The researchers found that: Average change in the total amount of air patients could breathe out QBW251 (51 patients) Placebo (23 patients) Before the inhaler 0.07 L 0.01 L QBW251 (51 patients) Placebo (24 patients) After the inhaler 0.03 L 0.01 L 7 Clinical Trial Results 3.
1847,"The total amount of air the patients lungs could hold Overall, the researchers learned that the patients who took QBW251 could take a deeper breath compared to the patients who took the placebo."
1848,The researchers measured the total amount of air the patients could breathe in.
1849,"If the average change in this amount had increased after 28 days of treatment, this meant that the patients could take a deeper breath."
1850,"After 28 days of treatment, the researchers found that: The lungs of the patients who took QBW251 could hold 0.01 L more air on average."
1851,The lungs of the patients who took the placebo could hold 0.07 L less air on average.
1853,"How much air got trapped in the lungs after the patients breathed out Overall, the researchers learned that the patients who took QBW251 had more trapped air in their lungs after breathing out compared to the patients who took the placebo."
1854,"This happened when the patients breathed out as much air as they could, and when they breathed out normally."
1855,"But, the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if QBW251 caused these differences."
1856,These differences may have been due to chance.
1857,The researchers measured how much air was trapped in the patients lungs after the patients breathed out.
1858,They measured this when the patients breathed out as much air as they could and when the patients breathed out normally.
1859,"If the average change in this amount increased after 28 days of treatment, this meant that more air got trapped in the patients lungs after breathing out."
1860,"The researchers found that when the patients breathed out as much air as they could after 28 days of treatment: On average, 0.03 L more air got trapped in the lungs of the patients who took QBW251."
1861,"On average, 0.02 L less air got trapped in the lungs of the patients who took the placebo."
1862,"The researchers found out that when patients breathed out normally after 28 days of treatment: On average, 0.01L more air got trapped in the lungs of patients who took QBW251."
1863,"On average, 0.02L less air got trapped in the lungs of patients who took the placebo."
1864,8 Clinical Trial Results 5.
1865,"How well the patients lungs moved a gas called carbon monoxide from the air into the blood Overall, the researchers learned that the patients who took QBW251 could not move more carbon monoxide into the blood than the patients who took the placebo."
1866,"But, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if QBW251 decreased the movement of carbon monoxide into the blood."
1867,This difference may have been due to chance.
1868,The researchers measured how much carbon monoxide was moved from the lungs into the blood.
1869,This measurement gives researchers an idea of how well the lungs can move oxygen from the lungs into the blood.
1870,"If the average change in this amount had increased after 28 days of treatment, this meant that the patients lungs could move more oxygen into their blood."
1871,"This difference was measured in milliliters per minute per millimeter of mercury, also called mL/min/mmHg."
1872,The researchers found that: The patients who took QBW251 decreased the amount of carbon monoxide that moved from their lungs into their blood by 0.9 mL/min/mmHg on average.
1873,The patients who took the placebo decreased the amount of carbon monoxide that moved from their lungs into their blood by 0.3 mL/min/mmHg on average.
1875,The researchers wanted to know how much QBW251 got into the blood.
1876,This information is important because it helps the researchers decide when a dose should be given to patients and what dose is safe and effective for patients.
1877,"After 28 days of treatment, the researchers found that: The amount of QBW251 in the blood was higher in the 2 patients who took 450 mg compared to the patients who took 300 mg. On average, QBW251 reached expected and steady levels in the blood."
1878,"After a single dose of QBW251, it took about 1.3 hours for QBW251 to reach its highest amount in the blood."
1879,"After multiple doses of QBW251, it took about 2.0 hours for QBW251 to reach its highest amount in the blood."
1880,9 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did patients have during the trial?
1882,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the patients need hospital care."
1889,Adverse events happened about as often in the patients who took QBW251 compared to the patients who took the placebo.
1890,Five patients who took QBW251 left the trial due to adverse events compared to 1 patient who took the placebo.
1891,The table below shows how many patients had adverse events during the trial.

1896,"Overall, only the patients taking QBW251 had serious adverse events."
1897,The serious adverse event of a stroke happened during the follow-up period.
1898,All other serious adverse events happened during the treatment period.
1899,The doctors thought the vomiting and low potassium in the blood might have been related to QBW251.
1900,The table below shows how many patients had serious adverse events during the trial.
1901,Serious adverse events during this trial Serious adverse event QBW251 (Out of 64 patients) Placebo (Out of 28 patients) Total (Out of 92 patients) Fluid in the lungs preventing oxygen from entering the blood 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) Low potassium in the blood 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) Pneumonia (lung infection) 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) Stroke 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) Vomiting 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) Worsening of COPD 1.6% (1) 0.0% (0) 1.1% (1) 11 Clinical Trial Results What were the most common adverse events?

1934,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug LHW090.
1935,You and all of the participants helped researchers learn more about how LHW090 works in people with resistant hypertension.
1936,Resistant hypertension is high blood pressure that stays high even after taking 3 or more medicines to lower it.
1942,You were in the trial for about 11 weeks.
1945,The trial started in November 2015 and ended in August 2017.
1946,"The trial included 64 participants in Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States."
1947,"When the trial ended, the sponsor reviewed the data collected and created a report of the results."
1950,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have high blood pressure.
1952,This information is important to know before other trials can be done that help find out if LHW090 improves the health of people with high blood pressure.
1953,"High blood pressure can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels."
1954,"Some people s blood pressure remains high, even after treatment with 3 or more medicines."
1955,This is called resistant hypertension.
1956,"People with resistant hypertension are at an increased risk of a heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure."
1957,"Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: LHW090 Protocol #: CLHW090X2202 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out how LHW090 works in a small number of participants with resistant hypertension."
1958,The researchers wanted to learn if LHW090 could lower the participants blood pressure.
1959,The body breaks down LHW090 into a substance called LHV527.
1960,"LHV527 helps the body increase levels of a hormone made by the heart called atrial natriuretic peptide, also called ANP."
1961,Increasing ANP levels in the blood may lower blood pressure by causing blood vessels to relax.
1962,It also may help the kidneys get rid of more salt and water.
1963,"In this trial, the researchers compared LHW090 with a placebo."
1965,Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the actual effects of a trial treatment.
1966,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did LHW090 lower the participants blood pressure?
1967,How much LHW090 and LHV527 got into the participants blood?
1970,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with resistant hypertension."
1971,The participants in this trial were 40 to 84 years old.
1972,The first part of the trial was single-blind .
1973,"This means the trial staff and sponsor staff knew what the participants were taking, but the participants did not."
1974,"During the first part of the trial, all of the participants took the placebo."
1975,This part was done to make sure the participants would take the trial drug as directed.
1976,The second part of the trial was site and subject double-blind .
1977,This means none of the participants or trial staff knew what treatment each participant took.
1978,"But, the sponsor staff did know what each participant took."
1979,"Some trials are done this way because if the participants and trial staff know what treatment the participants are taking, it can affect the results of the trial."
1981,"During the second part of this trial, the participants took either LHW090 or the placebo."
1982,"For both parts of the trial, the sponsor staff did not know the identity of any of the participants."
1983,A computer program was used to randomly choose the treatment each participant took in the second part of the trial.
1986,"Before the trial treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure the participants could take part in the trial."
1987,"The trial doctors checked the heart health of the participants using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG."
1988,The participants gave blood and urine samples.
1990,"During the first part of the trial, the participants took a placebo once a day for 2 weeks."
1991,"During this time, the participants continued to take their blood pressure medicines that they were already taking."
1992,"After 2 weeks, the participants who took the placebo as directed at least 80.0% of the time were allowed to enter the second part of the trial."
1993,The first part of the trial was designed this way so that the researchers could make sure the participants would take their treatments regularly in the second part of the trial.
1994,"During the second part of the trial, the participants visited the trial site at least 12 times."
1995,They took their treatment once a day for 4 weeks.
1996,"Doses were measured in milligrams, also called mg."
1997,The participants took either 100 mg or 200 mg capsules of LHW090 or the placebo by mouth.
1998,"During the second part of the trial, the participants also continued to take their blood pressure medicines."
1999,"Throughout the trial, the trial doctors: checked the participants blood pressure and heart rate at each visit asked the participants how they were feeling and about any other medicines they were taking at each visit asked the participants about their mental health at some visits took blood and urine samples and checked the participants heart health at some visits fitted the participants with a device that monitored their blood pressure for 24 hours at some visits About 1 week after the last trial treatment, the participants had their final visit at the trial site."
2000,"The trial doctors checked the physical health, mental health, and heart health of the participants."
2001,The trial doctors also asked how the participants were feeling and what medicines they were taking.
2003,The trial doctors called participants 30 days after their final visit to see how they were feeling.
2005,Second part of the trial 17 participants took 100 mg LHW090 15 participants took 200 mg LHW090 32 participants took the placebo After treatment The participants visited the trial site about 1 week after their final dose The trial doctors called participants 30 days after their final visit to see how they were feeling2 weeks First part of the trial 64 participants took the placebo once a day Before treatment Trial doctors did tests to make sure the participants could take part in the trial 4 weeksUp to 25 days 4 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
2006,This is a summary of the overall results from the trial.
2010,Did LHW090 lower the participants blood pressure?
2012,"After 4 weeks of treatment, LHW090 lowered the participants blood pressure more than the placebo did."
2013,"In a blood pressure reading, the top number is known as the systolic blood pressure ."
2014,It measures the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart beats.
2015,The bottom number in a blood pressure reading measures the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart rests between beats.
2016,This is known as the diastolic blood pressure .
2017,"In the trial, the researchers were interested in the systolic blood pressure changes the participants had during the daytime."
2018,"Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, also called mmHg."
2019,A decrease in mmHg meant lower blood pressure in the participants.
2020,"The researchers found that on average, after 4 weeks of treatment: The systolic blood pressure of the participants who took 100 mg of LHW090 decreased by 9.41 mmHg."
2021,The systolic blood pressure of the participants who took 200 mg of LHW090 decreased by 16.84 mmHg.
2022,The systolic blood pressure of the participants who took the placebo decreased by 0.79 mmHg.
2023,5 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows the change in the participants systolic blood pressure during the daytime.

2025,The researchers wanted to know how much LHW090 and LHV527 got into the participants blood.
2026,The researchers learned that: The amount of LHW090 and LHV527 in the blood was higher in the participants who took 200 mg of LHW090 compared to the participants who took 100 mg of LHW090.
2027,It took 2 to 3 hours for LHW090 to reach its highest amount in the participants blood.
2028,It took longer for LHV527 to show up in the participants blood compared to LHW090.
2029,It took 3 to 4 hours for LHV527 to reach its highest amount in the participants blood.
2030,LHW090 and LHV527 reached steady levels in the participants blood by Day 28 of treatment.
2031,6 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did the participants have?
2038,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that participants have during each trial."
2039,Adverse events were recorded for both parts of the trial.
2040,"But because the participants only took the trial drug in the second part of the trial, this section is a summary only of the adverse events that happened during the second part of the trial."
2042,A higher percentage of the participants who took 100 mg of LHW090 had adverse events during the second part of the trial compared to the participants who took 200 mg of LHW090 or the placebo.
2043,Two participants who took 100 mg of LHW090 left the trial because of adverse events.
2044,None of the participants had serious adverse events during the trial.
2046,The table below shows how many participants had adverse events during the second part of the trial.

2084,Thank you to the patients who took part in the clinical trial for the drug CSJ148.
2085,"The patients helped researchers learn more about CSJ148 and how to treat human cytomegalovirus, also called HCMV."
2086,This trial helped researchers find out if CSJ148 prevents active HCMV infection and disease in patients getting stem cell transplants who already have HCMV.
2087,Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important for the patients to know the results of this trial.
2088,An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the trial results for the patients.
2089,We hope it helps the patients understand their important role in medical research.
2090,"If the patients have questions about the results, they should speak with the doctor, research nurse, or other team members at their trial site."
2092,The patients were in this trial for about 7 months.
2093,"But, the trial took about a year and a half to complete."
2094,This is because the patients started and stopped the trial at different times.
2095,The trial started in June 2015 and ended in December 2016.
2096,"The trial included 86 patients from 17 trial sites in 6 countries: Belgium, Germany, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States."
2100,Researchers are looking for a safer way to treat patients who are at risk of developing HCMV disease.
2101,HCMV disease includes a range of health problems caused by an active HCMV infection.
2102,"Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical trials to find out how well the drug works and how safe the drug is."
2103,This information is important to know before other trials can be done to find out if CSJ148 improves the health of patients who have HCMV or who are at risk of getting HCMV.
2104,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: CSJ148 Protocol #: CCSJ148X2201 Clinical Trial Results 2 Clinical Trial Results Infection with HCMV is common.
2105,HCMV usually does not cause problems.
2106,"But, people with HCMV who have weak immune systems are at risk of developing HCMV disease."
2107,This includes patients who get stem cell transplants.
2108,Most patients who have HCMV can develop HCMV disease after stem cell transplants if no early treatment is given.
2109,The risk for HCMV disease is highest in the first 99 days after a transplant.
2110,CSJ148 helps HCMV stop spreading.
2111,CSJ148 is made of 2 antibodies that block the virus from infecting cells.
2112,Antibodies are normally made by the immune system to fight infection.
2113,"But, researchers can now use antibodies as medicines to treat a variety of conditions, including HCMV disease."
2114,Other treatments are available to prevent and treat HCMV disease.
2115,"But, these treatments may be toxic to patients who get stem cell transplants."
2116,"Because the treatments could damage the bone marrow, doctors only give these treatments when there is no other choice."
2117,"In this trial, the researchers compared CSJ148 with a placebo."
2120,The main questions the researchers asked in the trial were: Did CSJ148 reduce the number of patients who needed early HCMV treatment?
2121,Did CSJ148 increase the amount of time until starting early HCMV treatment?
2122,Did CSJ148 reduce the number of times a patient needed early HCMV treatment?
2123,Did CSJ148 reduce the number of patients who got HCMV disease?
2124,How much CSJ148 got into the blood?
2126,"To answer these questions in this trial, researchers asked for the help of women and men who have HCMV."
2127,The patients in this trial were 22 to 76 years old and were scheduled to have a stem cell transplant.
2128,They also had an old HCMV infection that could be found in their blood but was not active before the transplant.
2130,The first 6 patients in this trial got open-label CSJ148.
2131,"This means that the sponsor staff, trial staff, and the patients knew the patients were getting CSJ148."
2132,This helped the sponsor staff decide how often the patients in the rest of the trial got treatment with CSJ148.
2133,The rest of the trial included 80 patients and was a double-blind trial.
2134,"This means that none of the patients, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each patient got."
2135,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment the patients are getting can affect the results of the trial.
2136,A computer program was used to randomly assign the treatment each patient got.
2138,"When the trial ended, the sponsor staff found out which treatment patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
2140,"Before the trial treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure patients could take part in the trial."
2141,"The trial doctors: Measured HCMV levels in the blood Took blood and urine samples Checked the height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate of each patient Checked the heart health of each patient using an electrocardiogram During the trial, all patients started treatment before they had their stem cell transplant."
2142,"For every 3 patients who got the trial drug, 1 patient got the placebo."
2143,65 patients got CSJ148 every 4 weeks.
2144,21 patients got the placebo every 4 weeks.
2145,All patients got treatment through a needle put into a vein.
2146,"Throughout the trial, the trial staff: Checked the heart health and HCMV levels of patients before and after treatment Took blood and urine samples Asked questions about how patients felt and any other medicines they were taking The chart below shows how the trial was done."
2147,Before treatment 14 days Trial doctors measured HCMV levels in the blood Trial doctors checked the overall health of the patients Treatment 99 days 65 patients got CSJ148 through a needle in their vein every 4 weeks 21 patients got placebo through a needle in their vein every 4 weeks Patients had their stem cell transplant Follow-up 83 days Patients visited the site at least 3 times during the 83 days after their last dose of trial drug The follow-up period lasted 83 days.
2148,"During this time, the patients visited their site at least 3 more times."
2149,The trial doctors checked HCMV levels.
2150,They also checked how patients were feeling and what medicines patients were taking.
2152,"This is a summary of the overall results of this trial, not individual results."
2156,Patients should not make medical decisions based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
2157,Patients should always talk to a doctor before making any changes to medications or treatment plans.
2158,Did CSJ148 reduce the number of patients who needed early HCMV treatment?
2159,"Compared to getting the placebo, fewer patients who got CSJ148 needed early HCMV treatment."
2160,"But, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if CSJ148 changed how many patients needed early HCMV treatment."
2161,The difference could have been due to chance.
2162,The researchers wanted to know if treatment with CSJ148 reduced the number of patients who needed early HCMV treatment.
2163,"To answer this question, the researchers counted the number of patients in each treatment group who needed early HCMV treatment up to Day 99 after the stem cell transplant."
2164,The researchers found that: 36.9% of patients who got CSJ148 needed early treatment.
2165,This happened in 24 out of 65 patients.
2166,42.9% of patients who got the placebo needed early treatment.
2167,This happened in 9 out of 21 patients.
2168,The chart below shows how many patients needed early HCMV treatment in each treatment group up to Day 99 after the transplant.

2170,"Compared to getting the placebo, patients who got CSJ148 took more time on average before starting early HCMV treatment by Day 99."
2171,"But, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if CSJ148 changed the amount of time before patients started early HCMV treatment."
2173,The researchers found that: Patients who got CSJ148 took an average of 62.0 days before starting early HCMV treatment.
2174,Patients who got the placebo took an average of 49.5 days before starting early HCMV treatment.
2176,"By Day 99, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if CSJ148 reduced the number of times a patient needed early HCMV treatment."
2178,The researchers found that: The average number of times patients who got CSJ148 needed early HCMV treatment was 2.1 times.
2179,The average number of times patients who got the placebo needed early HCMV treatment was 2.5 times.
2182,CSJ148 did not reduce the number of patients who got HCMV disease.
2183,"Overall, 8 patients developed HCMV disease: 10.8% of patients who got CSJ148 developed HCMV disease during or after the trial."
2184,This happened in 7 out of 65 patients.
2185,4.8% of patients who got placebo developed HCMV disease during or after the trial.
2186,This happened in 1 out of 21 patients.
2188,"To find out how much CSJ148 got into the blood after treatment, researchers took blood samples during the trial."
2189,"Overall, they learned that the expected amount of CSJ148 was found in the blood in patients who got CSJ148."
2190,6 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did patients have?
2200,All patients had adverse events during the trial.
2201,This is normal for patients who get stem cell transplants.
2202,Two patients who got CSJ148 and 1 patient who got the placebo left the trial because of an adverse event.

2208,A total of 25.6% patients died during or after the trial.
2209,This was 22 out of 86 patients.
2210,The causes of death were complications from the stem cell transplants.
2211,"Most deaths occurred after the treatment period, or Day 99."
2212,The trial doctors did not think any of the deaths were related to CSJ148 treatment.
2213,The most common serious adverse event was severe graft versus host disease.
2214,This disease happens when the transplanted stem cells attack the body soon after the transplant.
2215,The trial doctors did not think this serious adverse event was related to the trial drugs.
2216,This is a common serious adverse event after a stem cell transplant.
2217,The table on the next page shows the most common serious adverse events that happened in more than 5.0% of patients.

2319,"To find out, the trial doctors used questions from the EULAR Sj gren s Syndrome Patient Reported Index, also called the ESSPRI."
2320,"The patients filled out the ESSPRI before, during, and after treatment."
2321,The ESSPRI is a questionnaire that measures how severe patients main PSS symptoms are.
2322,"The patients in this trial scored their tiredness, pain, and dryness symptoms each on a scale from 0 to 10."
2323,Lower scores meant that the symptoms were less severe.
2324,"After 12 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that on average: The main symptoms of the patients who took CDZ173 were decreased by 1.8 points."
2325,The main symptoms of the patients who took the placebo were decreased by 0.7 points.
2326,4 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows the change in the patients ESSPRI scores.
2327,1.8 points decrease Change in patients ESSPRI scores C ha ng e in p oi nt s CDZ173 4 3 2 1 0 5 0.7 points decrease Placebo Did CDZ173 change other aspects of the patients PSS?
2328,"Overall, there were changes to other aspects of the patients PSS in both the CDZ173 and placebo treatment groups."
2329,The researchers found that the patients in both treatment groups showed a slight decrease in their PSS symptoms based on each of these questionnaires.
2331,The researchers wanted to know if CDZ173 changed the patients symptoms.
2332,They also wanted to know if the patients PSS changed throughout the trial.
2333,"To find out, they used 5 other questionnaires."
2334,The table below shows the questionnaires that were used in the trial.
2335,"Name Description Completed by EULAR Sj gren s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (also called the ESSDAI) Measured how severe the patients PSS was during the trial Trial doctor 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (also called the SF-36) Measured the patients physical, emotional, and social well-being Patient Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (also called the MFI) Measured the patients tiredness Patient Visual Analog Scale (also called the VAS) Measured the patients overall health Trial doctor and patient (2 versions) 5 Clinical Trial Results The patients got these questionnaires before, during, and after treatment."
2336,The scores from these questionnaires helped the researchers learn how the patients symptoms and PSS changed throughout the trial.
2338,"To find out how much CDZ173 got into the patients blood, the trial doctors took blood samples throughout the trial."
2339,The researchers learned that in the patients who took CDZ173: CDZ173 took an average of 1 hour to reach its highest amount in the blood.
2340,CDZ173 reached steady and expected levels in the blood.
2341,This information is important because it helps the researchers decide when a dose should be given and what dose is safe and effective for patients.
2345,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or the patient needs hospital care."
2351,6 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had adverse events?
2352,Most of the patients in this trial had adverse events.
2353,"Compared to the patients who took the placebo, more patients who took CDZ173 stopped taking the trial drug because of an adverse event."
2354,One patient left the trial because of an adverse event.

2361,One patient experienced a serious adverse event of a severe rash.
2362,This was 3.3% of the patients.
2363,The trial doctors thought that this serious adverse event was caused by the trial drug.
2364,None of the patients died during this trial.
2365,7 Clinical Trial Results What were the most common adverse events?
2366,Rash and upper respiratory tract infection caused by a virus were the 2 most common adverse events during this trial.
2367,These adverse events occurred in more patients who took CDZ173 than in patients who took the placebo.
2368,The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened in 10.0% or more of all the patients.

2402,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug BAF312, also called siponimod."
2403,You helped researchers learn more about how BAF312 works in people with active dermatomyositis or DM.
2404,This trial started in November 2013 and ended in February 2016.
2409,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: BAF312 (Siponimod) Protocol #: CBAF312X2206 Full Trial Title: A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate, safety, tolerability, efficacy and preliminary dose-response of BAF312 in patients with active dermatomyositis (DM) Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: November 2013 to February 2016 Clinical Trial Results 2 What s happened since the trial ended?"
2410,"You were in this trial for up to 48 weeks, but the trial took close to two and a half years to complete."
2411,"The trial included 17 patients from 24 sites in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, Poland, Taiwan, and the United States."
2412,Researchers ended the trial earlier than planned because the researchers could not get clear results.
2413,"When the trial ended in February 2016, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
2416,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat DM.
2417,"People with DM have weakness in their muscles, especially in the hips, thighs, upper arms, shoulder area, and neck."
2418,DM can also cause skin symptoms.
2419,The cause of DM is unknown.
2420,DM shares many characteristics with autoimmune diseases in which the body mistakenly attacks itself.
2421,Researchers have found that in DM some white blood cells (called lymphocytes) build up around blood vessels in the muscles and skin.
2422,The build-up of lymphocytes causes inflammation.
2423,Inflammation caused by lymphocytes in the muscles and skin may damage those areas and cause your medical condition.
2424,The trial drug BAF312 lowers the number of lymphocytes found in the blood stream.
2425,"In this trial, researchers wanted to find out if BAF312 helps lower the number of lymphocytes in people with DM."
2426,Researchers also wanted to know if lowering the number of lymphocytes in the blood stream helps with muscle strength in people with DM.
2427,Researchers compared BAF312 with a placebo.
2429,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: Does BAF312 help with muscle strength more than the placebo in patients with DM?"
2430,Did BAF312 lower lymphocyte counts in the blood in patients with DM?
2431,What medical problems did patients with DM have during the trial?
2433,The patients in this trial were 22 to 61 years old and had active DM.
2435,This trial had 2 parts: Part 1 and Part 2.
2436,Part 1 was double-blind .
2437,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what drug each patient took."
2438,Some trials are done this way because knowing what drug each patient is getting can affect the results of the trial.
2440,"During Part 1, patients took either BAF312 or a placebo."
2441,"Clinical Trial Results 3 When the Sponsor ended the trial early, the Sponsor found out which drug patients took in Part 1."
2442,Part 2 was open-label .
2443,"This means that the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, and the Sponsor knew what drug each patient took."
2444,"During Part 2, all patients took BAF312."
2445,"After the trial ended, the sponsor created a report of the trial results."
2448,"Double-Blind & Open-Label Trial Part 1: Double- Blind Treatment (17 Patients) 24 weeks Patients took either: 0.5, 2.0, or 10.0 mg BAF312 daily or Placebo Part 2: Open- Label Treatment (17 Patients) 24 weeks All patients took 2.0 mg BAF312 Follow-Up Period 4 weeks Patients were followed for 4 weeks after their last dose of trial drug."
2449,Patients had their last check-up on Day 196 (if they stopped after Part 1) or Day 364 (if they stopped after Part 2).
2450,Trial doctors did a full check-up of all patients to make sure they could join the trial.
2451,"In Part 1, patients were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to take either BAF312 or the placebo."
2452,Patients gave blood and urine samples.
2453,"Trial doctors checked the height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate of the patients."
2454,"Trial doctors also checked the heart health of patients using an electrocardiogram, or ECG, and asked patients about their symptoms."
2455,"Part 1 lasted 24 weeks: Patients took either 0.5 milligrams (mg), 2.0 mg, or 10.0 mg of BAF312 or a placebo once a day during Part 1 for 24 weeks."
2456,"Part 2 lasted 24 weeks: After finishing Part 1, patients could have continued into Part 2."
2457,All patients took 2.0 mg of BAF312 once a day during Part 2 for 24 more weeks.
2458,"For Parts 1 and 2, patients had a titration period of 10 days at the beginning of each part."
2459,Titration means that patients started with a low dose and increased their dose over time to reach the full dose after 10 days of treatment.
2460,"Throughout the trial, trial doctors measured the muscle strength of patients, took their blood and urine samples, and checked their height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate."
2461,Clinical Trial Results 4 The follow-up period lasted 4 weeks: Patients had a final checkup if they stopped after Part 1 or Part 2.
2462,"After finishing Part 1 or Part 2 treatment, trial doctors still checked how patients were feeling and if their symptoms were improving for 4 weeks."
2466,Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest for patients.
2469,Did BAF312 help with muscle strength more than a placebo in patients with DM?
2471,"Overall, the difference between the treatments was not large enough to show that BAF312 helped with muscle strength compared to a placebo after 24 weeks of treatment."
2472,"To find out if BAF312 helped with muscle strength more than the placebo, trial doctors used a test that looked at how well patients could use different muscles in their body."
2473,"For example, patients were asked to sit in a chair and lift one arm."
2474,The trial doctor then pressed on that arm.
2475,The trial doctor told the patients to resist the doctor s pushing as best they could.
2476,Trial doctors gave each patient a score based on what they saw when testing muscle strength in patients.
2477,"The higher the score, the better the muscle strength."
2478,Researchers found that: Placebo: Patients who took the placebo had a change of 27.7 points after 24 weeks of treatment BAF312 0.5 mg: Patients who took 0.5 mg of BAF312 had a change of 28.3 points after 24 weeks of treatment BAF312 2.0 mg: Patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 had a change of 12.4 points after 24 weeks of treatment BAF312 10.0 mg: Patients who took 10.0 mg of BAF312 had a change of 14.0 points after 24 weeks of treatment.
2479,"The results showed that, overall, none of the BAF312 doses were better than the placebo at helping with muscle strength."
2480,The small difference seen between the placebo group and the BAF312 0.5 mg group is probably due to chance.
2481,Clinical Trial Results 5 The figure below shows the results of the muscle strength test for all patients in the trial after 24 weeks of treatment.

2484,BAF312 did lower the number lymphocytes found in the blood stream.
2485,"However, this change in lymphocyte count was not associated with a change in muscle strength."
2486,What medical problems did patients with DM have?
2492,The tables below and on the next page show how many patients had adverse events and serious adverse events during each part of the trial.

2531,"A clinical trial to test the trial drug CJM112 in patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa Overview of results In this clinical trial, researchers studied how patients with a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS, responded to a drug named CJM112."
2532,What you should know about clinical trials A clinical trial is a type of research used to learn more about how our bodies respond to drugs or other treatments.
2534,The researchers wanted to study: The effects of the trial drug CJM112 on the severity of HS during and after 16 weeks of treatment How much CJM112 got into patients blood The effects of CJM112 on patients immune system Any medical problems that patients reported during the clinical trial Who was in this clinical trial?
2535,66 male and female adults with moderate to severe HS started this clinical trial.
2537,This study was a Phase 2 clinical trial.
2538,That means the clinical trial tested how well the trial drug CJM112 worked for people with HS.
2540,"Researchers looked for any medical problems, called adverse events, that happened during this clinical trial."
2541,"Patients reported a number of adverse events, including 2 serious adverse events, a groin abscess and chest pain."
2542,The trial drug is not believed to have caused any serious adverse events.
2543,What was learned in this clinical trial?
2544,"Researchers found that after getting high doses of CJM112 for 16 weeks, HS was less severe in patients and that CJM112 did not show safety concerns for the patients in this clinical trial."

2554,9 Why was this clinical trial needed?
2555,Researchers asked patients to help them test a trial drug named CJM112.
2556,"Researchers wanted to learn about how CJM112 works in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, which is also called HS."
2557,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with HS.
2558,HS is a long-term skin disease that causes boils or lumps most often in the armpits and groin.
2559,"HS usually begins with boils, or lumps, under the skin that are also called lesions."
2560,"At first, these look like pimples."
2561,"Then, they often grow bigger and many fill with thick fluid (pus)."
2562,"HS can be painful, cause scars, and limit how people can use their arms and legs."
2563,"Researchers don t know what causes HS, but think the immune system may have a role."
2564,Our immune system is made of cells and proteins that can protect us from disease and infection.
2565,"Researchers think that a protein in our body s immune system, called IL-17 might cause swelling (inflammation) that creates the boils or lumps of HS."
2566,Researchers wanted to learn if CJM112 can block IL-17 and decrease the severity of HS.
2567,Researchers need many clinical trials to learn if a medicine is safe and works well.
2568,"This is a summary of the overall results of this clinical trial, not the results for each patient in the clinical trial."
2569,Do not use the results of this clinical trial to make health care decisions.
2570,Always talk to a doctor before making any changes to your treatment.
2571,What is IL-17?
2572,Il-17 is the name of one of the many proteins in our body.
2573,Researchers want to learn if IL-17 causes the swelling that creates the boils of HS.
2574,"3 In this clinical trial, researchers compared CJM112 to a placebo."
2577,A placebo is used so that no one in the clinical trial knows who got the trial drug or the placebo.
2578,"In this clinical trial, the placebo was injected just like CJM112."
2579,"In this clinical trial, the researchers wanted to study: The effects of CJM112 on the severity of HS during and after 16 weeks How much CJM112 got into patients blood The effects of CJM112 on patients immune system Any medical problems that patients reported during the clinical trial Who was in this trial?"
2580,The researchers recruited 66 adult patients 22 male and 44 female to begin the 44 week-long clinical trial.
2581,They hoped at least 60 would complete the first part of the clinical trial.
2582,All patients were between 18 and 65 years of age.
2583,The average age of patients was 37 years old.
2584,"Some patients dropped out of the clinical trial, so that by the end of the trial: 60 patients finished Period 1 that lasted 16 weeks 50 patients finished Period 2 that lasted 16 more weeks 49 patients finished a follow-up period that lasted 12 more weeks Everyone in this trial had moderate to severe HS for at least one year before the trial began."
2585,All patients had received treatment for HS with antibiotics but no other treatment for HS within 4 weeks before joining this trial.
2586,Researchers conducted this trial with patients at 16 health care centers.
2587,"Those centers were located in Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, United States, and Germany."
2589,This was a Phase 2 clinical trial.
2590,Researchers tested how well this trial drug worked and looked for any medical problems that occurred in a small number of patients.
2591,"None of the patients, research staff, or sponsor staff knew which patients got CJM112 or a placebo."
2592,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment each patient got can affect the results of the trial.
2594,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out what all patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
2595,Each patient took part in the clinical trial for up to 44 weeks.
2596,They started at different dates during the trial.
2597,"This trial began in April, 2015 and ended in November, 2016."
2598,4 What happened during this clinical trial?
2599,"First, researchers randomly placed patients into groups using a computer program."
2600,This trial had 2 periods.
2601,Each period lasted 16 weeks.
2602,"Then, there was a 12 week follow-up period."
2603,This trial tested both high doses and low doses of CJM112.
2604,Patients got CJM112 or the placebo by a needle placed under their skin.
2605,"Period 1 lasted 16 weeks: 29 patients got 10 high doses of CJM112 31 patients got 10 doses of the placebo 6 patients did not complete Period 1 Period 2 lasted 16 weeks: From the group who got a high dose of CJM112 in Period 1, 22 patients got the placebo in Period 2 From the group who got the placebo in Period 1: o 13 patients got 10 low doses of CJM112 in Period 2 o 14 patients got 10 high doses of CJM112 in Period 2 11 patients did not complete Period 2 The figure below shows how this clinical trial was designed and the number of patients who started each period: 5 Follow-up period lasted 12 weeks: During this time patients returned 3 more times That allowed the researchers to learn how patients were feeling and how severe their HS was over time During the entire trial, the research staff took blood samples and checked the patients general health and HS symptoms."
2607,"This is a summary of the overall results of this clinical trial, not the individual results of each patient in the clinical trial."
2609,Results presented here are for a single clinical trial.
2610,Do not use the results of only this clinical trial to make decisions about your health care.
2611,Always talk to a doctor before making changes to your treatment.
2612,"Main results In this trial, researchers learned about the effects of CJM112 on the severity of HS during and after 16 weeks."
2613,Researchers measured the severity of HS at several times during this study by measuring patients HS symptoms on a scale.
2614,A patient s severity had to lower by a certain amount for researchers to count their HS as less severe.
2615,"After 16 weeks of treatment, the severity of HS was lower for more patients who got CJM112 than for patients who got the placebo."
2616,Number of patients with lower severity of HS after 16 weeks 10 of the 31 patients (32%) who got the high dose of CJM112 had lower severity of HS.
2617,4 of the 32 patients (13%) who got the placebo had lower severity of HS.
2618,"10 21 28 4 6 For some patients, the severity of HS decreased during the 16 week trial."
2619,"After weeks 2, 4, and 12, the severity decreased for more patients who got CJM112 than for those who got the placebo."
2620,This difference was too small for researchers to know for sure that CJM112 caused it.
2621,"After week 8, the severity of HS decreased for slightly more patients who got the placebo compared to those who got CJM112."
2622,"Other key results In this trial, researchers also learned: The level of CJM112 in patients blood."
2623,Researchers collected samples of blood from patients during the trial to measure how much of the trial drug CJM112 got into their blood after each treatment.
2624,Researchers learned that the amount of CJM112 found in their blood was the amount expected for this type of trial drug.
2625,The effects of CJM112 on patients immune systems.
2626,Our body has an immune system that helps protect us from disease and infection.
2627,One of the ways our immune system protects us is by creating proteins called antibodies.
2628,The immune system uses antibodies to defend against foreign things like a virus or bacteria.
2629,"Sometimes, antibodies are formed against medicines like the trial drug CJM112 when it enters the body."
2630,"In this trial, 1 patient who got the high dose of CJM112 developed antibodies that worked against CJM112."
2631,That seemed to have an effect on how CJM112 worked.
2632,"Other patients in this trial also developed the same antibodies, but in those cases it did not seem to have an effect on how CJM112 worked."
2633,Antibodies against CJM112 did not cause any medical problems for any patients in this trial.
2634,The trial drug CJM112 was designed to interfere with how the immune system protein IL-17 works.
2635,IL-17 may play a role in increasing HS.
2636,Researchers tested how much IL- 17 was in the patients blood.
2637,The results of this early and small clinical trial confirmed that CJM112 did work as designed.
2638,More and larger studies are needed to confirm if this is always the case.
2639,7 What medical problems did patients report?
2643,"During this clinical trial, patients reported all adverse events to the researchers."
2644,"Researchers kept track of all adverse events, whether or not they were caused by the trial drug."
2645,"Overall, 5 patients dropped out of this trial because of adverse events."
2646,How many patients reported a serious adverse event?
2647,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, requires a hospital stay, can cause disability or permanent damage, or can cause a birth defect."
2648,Two patients (3%) reported a serious adverse event during the trial while being given the placebo.
2649,The two patients reported: A groin abscess 1 patient developed a groin abscess during the trial and needed a hospital stay.
2650,A groin abscess is an infection under the skin between the belly and thigh that swells and often requires surgery.
2651,Chest pain 1 patient reported chest pain that was caused by heart disease.
2652,The doctors who led this trial did not believe these serious adverse events were related to the trial drug.
2654,Some patients had medical problems or adverse events that were not serious.
2655,This section shows the most common adverse events reported during the trial.
2656,Not all adverse events reported are listed here.
2657,This summary only lists the adverse events reported by at least 10% of all patients in each period.
2658,"For example, if a group had 60 patients and 6 or more patients reported the same adverse event then it is reported here."
2659,What is a placebo?
2661,Patients didn t know if they got CJM112 or a placebo.
2662,"8 In Period 1, non-serious adverse events reported by at least 10% of patients were the common cold, nausea, headache, and diarrhea."
2663,"In Period 2, at least 10% of patients reported the common cold and headache."
2664,Adverse events that were not serious and reported by at least 10 percent of patients during Period 1 Adverse events that were not serious and reported by at least 10 percent of patients during Period 2 CJM112 high dose Placebo CJM112 high dose CJM112 low dose Placebo 9 How has this clinical trial helped?
2665,This was the first clinical trial of CJM112 in patients with HS.
2666,The results of this trial helped researchers better understand how the body reacts to different doses of CJM112 and if the trial drug can help decrease HS symptoms.
2667,This research may help future patients by helping doctors understand more about CJM112 as a possible treatment for HS.
2670,Researchers use the results of many clinical trials to help decide which treatments work best and are the safest.
2674,"If you were a patient in this clinical trial and have questions about the results, speak with the trial doctor or staff where you took part in this clinical trial."

2696,Overview of results Thank you!
2698,Who was in this trial?
2699,Main results Other key results How many patients reported a serious adverse event?
2703,You helped researchers answer important health questions about medical treatments.
2704,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug fingolimod.
2705,You helped researchers learn more about how fingolimod works in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
2706,This trial started in June 2012 and ended in July 2015.
2707,"Novartis, the sponsor of this trial, thanks you for your help and believes it is important for you to know the results of your trial."
2708,An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP and a medical writing organization called Synchrogenix prepared this summary of the trial results for you.
2711,Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: FTY720 / fingolimod National Clinical Trial #: NCT01623596 Protocol #: CFTY720DUS09 Trial Date: June 2012 to July 2015 Short Trial Title: A trial to test if people stayed on treatment with fingolimod longer than other treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 2 Clinical Trial Results What s happened since the trial ended?
2712,Your trial started in June 2012 and ended in July 2015.
2713,"You were in the trial for up to 1 year, but the entire trial lasted about 3 years."
2714,There were 875 participants at 117 trial centers in the United States.
2715,"When the trial ended in July 2015, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
2718,Researchers wanted to learn more about treatment for patients with RRMS.
2719,"Earlier studies have shown that fingolimod and other multiple sclerosis disease- modifying treatments, sometimes called MS-DMTs, have helped patients with RRMS."
2720,MS-DMTs also include drugs such as interferons and glatiramer acetate.
2721,"Some MS-DMTs, such as fingolimod, are taken by mouth, while other MS-DMTs are taken by injection (shot) and are known as injectable MS-DMTs, or MS-iDMTs."
2722,Earlier trials have shown that many patients do not take their MS-iDMTs for as long as they are supposed to.
2723,"Instead, they stop taking them before their doctor tells them to stop."
2724,"In this trial, researchers wanted to know which treatment participants would stay on longer over a 12-month period."
2725,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were as follows: Which treatment did participants stay on longer over 12 months?
2726,What medical problems did participants have?
2727,"To answer these questions, researchers asked men and women like you to volunteer for this trial."
2728,All the participants had RRMS and were between 18 and 65 years old.
2729,"Like you, either everyone was treated with only one type of MS- iDMT or was never treated with an MS-iDMT before this trial."
2730,"During the trial, participants could not use any other treatment for RRMS and women could not be pregnant."
2732,This was an open-label trial. This means that the participant and the trial staff knew which treatment each participant took.
2733,You were randomly assigned to take either fingolimod or an MS-iDMT during the treatment period.
2734,Half of the participants took fingolimod and half took an MS-iDMT.
2736,There were 2 groups in this trial: 1.
2737,Fingolimod 433 participants took 0.5 milligram (mg) of fingolimod by mouth every day for 12 months.
2739,MS-iDMT 428 participants took one of the MS-iDMTs.
2740,The trial doctors decided which MS-iDMT to give each participant based on the best MS-iDMT available and what kind of MS-iDMT the participant may have taken in the past.
2741,Participants were asked to take the assigned MS-iDMT as prescribed by the trial doctor for 12 months.
2742,The chart below shows both groups.
2743,Participants were allowed to switch from one group to the other once during the study.
2744,Participants could switch before the 3-month visit if they felt that the treatment was not working or if they were having any problems with the treatment.
2745,"If participants decided to switch after the 3-month visit, they could do so for any reason."
2746,Two Groups in This Trial Fingolimod (433 participants) MS-iDMT (428 participants) Up to 4 weeks before the Baseline Visit.
2747,"Informed Consent, Screening Tests, and Assignment to Treatment."
2748,"Check up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12."
2749,Allowed to switch to other treatment group once during the study.
2750,Screening Period Up to 4 weeks before the Baseline Visit.
2752,Baseline Visit First dose of MS-iDMT.
2753,First dose of fingolimod with 6-hour watch period for low heart rate.
2754,"Open-label Treatment Period Screening Period Baseline Visit Open-label Treatment Period Check up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12."
2756,"During the Screening Period, you gave consent to participate in the trial."
2757,"You had blood tests, a checkup, and answered questions about your MS and any other health problems."
2758,You had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test of your brain.
2759,"You had your eyes checked, and you had your heart checked with an electrocardiogram (ECG)."
2760,"4 Clinical Trial Results At the Baseline Visit, you had a checkup and filled out questionnaires about how you were managing physically, how your work and daily living activities were affected by your MS, your quality of life, and how satisfied you were with your current medicine."
2761,"You were given a test called a cognitive test to check how well you were thinking, reasoning, understanding, learning, and remembering things."
2762,You were given the first dose of trial medicine.
2763,"If you took fingolimod, you were watched and had your heart rate and blood pressure checked every hour for 6 hours after taking the medicine."
2764,You had an ECG before and after taking it.
2765,You were then given your trial medicine and instructions on how to take it at home.
2766,"During the Treatment Period, you went to office visits at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the Baseline Visit."
2767,"At each of these visits, you filled out questionnaires and had a checkup, had vital signs checked, and had blood tests."
2768,"At the 3-month visit, you also had your eyes checked."
2769,"At the 6- and 12 month visits, you had another MRI, and a cognitive test."
2771,This is a summary of the overall findings from your trial and may not be the same for each participant.
2772,Researchers look at results of many studies to decide which treatments work best and are safest for patients.
2773,Other studies may provide new information or different results.
2775,Which treatment did participants stay on longer over 12 months?
2776,More participants in the fingolimod group than in the MS-iDMT group stayed on treatment for 12 months.
2777,"In the fingolimod group, 352 of 433 participants (81%) stayed on treatment for 12 months."
2778,"In the MS-iDMT group, 125 of 428 participants (29%) stayed on treatment for 12 months."
2779,5 Clinical Trial Results These results are shown in the chart below.
2780,Percent of Participants Who Stayed on Treatment for 12 Months 352 of 433 participants given fingolimod stayed on treatment for 12 months 125 of 428 participants given MS-iDMT stayed on treatment for 12 months 81% 29% P e rc e n t o f P a rt ic ip a n ts 0 20 40 60 80 100 What medical problems did participants have?
2781,A lot of research is needed to know whether treatment causes a medical problem.
2783,These medical problems are called adverse events. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
2784,6 Clinical Trial Results How many participants had adverse events in the trial?
2785,Researchers looked at adverse events by patient-year or by how many adverse events occurred for every year participants took each trial drug.
2786,"In order to look at the adverse event rates in the trial (called AE rates), researchers divided the number of adverse events the participants had by the total number of years all participants were exposed to the trial drugs (called patient-years)."
2787,This gave researchers AE rates that were compared between the fingolimod and MS-iDMT groups.
2788,More than half the participants in the trial who took at least 1 dose of trial drug and had at least 1 check up after starting the trial drug had adverse events.
2789,Researchers found that those participants who received MS-iDMTs had a higher rate of adverse events than participants who took fingolimod.
2790,"Participants who took fingolimod had about 4 AEs for every year they took fingolimod, while participants who took MS-iDMTs had 7 AEs for every year they took those drugs."
2791,"Most adverse events were not serious, and trial doctors believed that they were related to the known side effects of shots such as pain or redness where the shot was given."
2792,Adverse event rates per patient-year in the trial Fingolimod 433 participants MS-iDMT 428 participants What was the adverse event rate during the trial?
2793,4.0 per patient-year 7.0 per patient-year What was the rate of participants who stopped treatment because of adverse events?
2794,0.1 per patient-year 0.5 per patient-year How many had an adverse event related to treatment?
2795,180 participants (42%) 242 participants (57%) 7 Clinical Trial Results Did any participants have serious adverse events?
2797,"In this trial, participants had less than 1 serious adverse event per patient-year for both the fingolimod group and the MS-iDMT group."
2798,"The most common serious adverse event for participants taking fingolimod was infections, while the most common serious adverse event in participants taking MS-iDMTs was MS relapse."
2800,The table below shows the AE rates for the most common adverse events that happened in at least 10% of participants in this trial.

2816,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the treatment RLX030, also known as serelaxin."
2817,You helped researchers learn about how RLX030 works in people with heart disease.
2822,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Treatment Studied: RLX030 (Serelaxin) Protocol #: CRLX030A2203 Full Trial Title: A multicenter, double blind, randomized, parallel group placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of intravenous serelaxin infusion on micro- and macro-vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: February 2014 to August 2016 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
2823,You were in this trial for a little over half a year.
2824,The whole trial took about 2.5 years to complete.
2825,This is because people started and stopped the trial at different times.
2826,The trial included 58 patients from 3 trial sites in the United Kingdom.
2830,"In this trial, researchers were looking at how the trial treatment worked in patients with a type of heart disease called coronary artery disease, which is also called CAD."
2831,People with CAD often get a substance called plaque in blood vessels in and around the heart.
2833,"When plaque forms in these blood vessels, called arteries, it makes them narrow and might block them completely."
2834,This reduces blood flow to the heart and can cause chest pain or heart attacks.
2835,"Sometimes, patients with CAD also have stiff arteries."
2836,"The stiffer the blood vessel walls are, the harder the heart has to work to pump blood into the arteries."
2837,The trial treatment RLX030 is a man-made type of relaxin.
2838,Relaxin can increase blood flow and can also change how the heart and kidneys work.
2839,Researchers in this trial wanted to know if RLX030 increased blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart.
2840,They also wanted to find out if RLX030 reduced the stiffness of arteries.
2841,"In this trial, researchers compared RLX030 to a placebo."
2843,Using a placebo helps researchers understand the actual effect of a trial treatment.
2844,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: Did RLX030 increase blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart more than the placebo?
2845,Did RLX030 reduce stiffness of the arteries more than the placebo?
2846,Did RLX030 help more than the placebo in other ways?
2847,How much RLX030 got into the blood?
2850,The patients in this trial were 41 to 74 years old.
2851,They all had CAD.
2852,Patients enrolled in this study were allowed to continue their medicines they were already taking to treat CAD.
2855,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were getting RLX030 or the placebo."
2858,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out what all the patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
2861,They did the following: Checked your heart health.
2862,Took blood and urine samples.
2863,Took pictures of your heart to check blood flow using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
2864,Checked your blood pressure and how stiff your arteries were.
2865,"During the trial: 30 patients got 30 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, or g/kg, of RLX030."
2866,28 patients got the placebo.
2867,You got RLX030 or the placebo through a needle put into a vein.
2868,"This took 48 hours, or 2 days."
2869,The treatment you got was decided randomly by using a computer program.
2870,To check your health and CAD symptoms: Trial staff checked your blood pressure and heart rate during treatment.
2871,They checked blood flow in the vessels of and around your heart and how stiff your arteries were.
2872,They also checked these things after treatment.
2873,You gave blood and urine samples.
2874,You answered questions about how you felt and any other medicines you were taking.
2875,The chart below shows how patients got treatment.
2876,"Treatment lasted 48 hours 30 patients got 30 g/kg of RLX030 through a needle in their vein 28 patients got the placebo through a needle in their vein Patients had their heart function and health checked before, during and after treatment Patients gave blood and urine samples before and after the treatment You had 2 more appointments."
2877,These were on Day 30 and Day 180 after the treatment to check your health.
2884,4 Clinical Trial Results Did RLX030 increase blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart more than the placebo?
2886,The difference between the treatments was too small for the researchers to know if RLX030 increased blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart more than the placebo.
2887,The difference could be due to chance.
2888,"To answer this question, the researchers used an MRI to check blood flow to the heart."
2889,"To do this, researchers gave patients a small amount of a medicine called adenosine that opens the blood vessels like exercising does."
2890,"This causes more blood to flow, which acts like the amount of blood flow to the heart seen when someone is active."
2891,"Then, researchers compared this result to the blood flow when patients were not given adensosine."
2892,"Before and after 48 hours of treatment, patients who got RLX030 had about the same blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart as patients who got the placebo."
2893,This happened when patients got adenosine and when they didn t get adenosine.
2894,"The chart below shows this blood flow in milliliters per gram per minute , or mL/g/min, for participants when they got adenosine and when they didn t get adenosine."
2895,"Overall blood flow in and around the heart before and after 48 hours of treatment RLX030 B lo o d f lo w ( m L /g /m in ) 2.54 1.26 2.32 1.24 Placebo 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.34 1.19 2.21 1.16 Day 1 Day 3 Day 1 Day 3 No adenosine With adenosine No adenosine With adenosine Then, researchers did the same blood flow test on a specific part of the heart."
2896,This part of the heart has the most muscle.
2897,Researchers found that patients who got RLX030 also had about the same blood flow in the vessels of and around the heart as patients who got the placebo.
2899,The chart below shows blood flow in mL/g/min in this part of the heart.
2900,"Blood flow in the part of the heart with the most muscle before and after 48 hours of treatment B lo o d f lo w ( m L /g /m in ) 2.45 1.22 2.16 1.17 Day 1 Day 3 2.23 1.15 2.14 1.09 Day 1 Day 3 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 No adenosine With adenosine No adenosine With adenosine RLX030 Placebo 5 Clinical Trial Results For both measures, no overall difference in the blood flow of the vessels of and around the heart was seen in patients who got RLX030 compared to patients who got the placebo."
2903,The difference between the treatments was too small for the researchers to know if RLX030 reduced the stiffness of arteries more than the placebo.
2905,Researchers used a medical device to measure the stiffness of the arteries called augmentation index .
2906,They learned that patients who got RLX030 had arteries about as stiff as patients who got the placebo.
2907,The researchers also measured how stiff arteries were on Day 30 and Day 180.
2908,They found no differences between patients who got RLX030 and patients who got the placebo.
2909,The results were the same on both of these days.
2911,Researchers also looked at the following: Vessel stiffness using another test called pulse wave velocity .
2912,"Stiffness of the main artery in the body called the aorta In both cases, researchers found no difference between patients who got RLX030 and patients who got the placebo after 48 hours of treatment."
2914,The researchers checked your blood samples to learn how much RLX030 got into the blood after treatment.
2915,They learned that: The amount of RLX030 they expected got into patients blood.
2916,RLX030 reached steady levels in the blood between 24 and 48 hours of the treatment in most patients.
2917,RLX030 left the blood quickly starting around 48 hours after the treatment ended.
2922,These problems may or may not be caused by the trial treatment.
2924,"During a trial, all medical problems are reported and written down, whether or not they are caused by the trial treatment."
2925,"So, when new treatments are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that patients have."
2927,6 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had adverse events during the trial?
2928,"During the trial, researchers kept track of the adverse events."
2929,"These adverse events were collected for all patients, whether they got RLX030 or placebo: 62.1% of all patients in the trial had at least 1 adverse event."
2930,This was 36 out of the 58 patients.
2931,20.7% of all patients in the trial had serious adverse events.
2932,This was 12 out of the 58 patients.
2933,3.4% of all patients in the trial stopped treatment because of adverse events.

2943,During the trial: 16.7% of patients who got RLX030 had serious adverse events.
2944,This was 5 out of the 30 patients.
2945,25.0% of patients who got the placebo had serious adverse events.
2946,This was 7 out of the 28 patients.
2947,7 Clinical Trial Results The serious adverse event that happened most often was heart attack.
2948,This happened in about the same number of patients who got RLX030 and the placebo.
2949,The table below shows the serious adverse events that were reported by at least 3% or 2 of all patients.
2950,"Serious adverse events during this trial Serious adverse event RLX030 (Out of 30 patients) Placebo (Out of 28 patients) Total (Out of 58 patients) Serious heart attack 6.7% (2) 3.6% (1) 5.2% (3) Chest pain caused by less blood flow to the heart 3.3% (1) 3.6% (1) 3.4% (2) Sudden heart-related chest pain 3.3% (1) 3.6% (1) 3.4% (2) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the website noted at the end of the summary."
2952,The most common non-serious adverse event was headache.

2978,You helped researchers learn more about how BAF312 works in people with active polymyositis or PM.
2983,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: BAF312 (Siponimod) Protocol #: CBAF312X2205 Full Trial Title: A multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of BAF312 in patients with polymyositis Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: April 2013 to August 2016 V0.4 2 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 What s happened since the trial ended?"
2984,"You were in this trial for up to 9 months, but the trial took more than 3 years to complete."
2986,"The trial planned to include at least 45 patients from 20 sites in 8 countries: Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States."
2987,"But, only 14 patients enrolled."
2988,Researchers ended the trial earlier than planned because they could not find enough patients with PM in time to join the trial.
2989,"So, the researchers could not get clear results."
2990,"When the trial ended, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
2993,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat PM.
2994,"People with PM have muscle weakness, tenderness, and pain."
2995,These symptoms are caused by white blood cells in the immune system called T-lymphocytes that inflame the muscle.
2996,This inflammation may damage the muscle.
2997,"People with PM may also have higher levels of an enzyme in the blood called creatine kinase, or CK."
2998,"The amount of CK in the blood can rise when tissues that use CK, like skeletal muscles, are damaged."
2999,The trial drug BAF312 makes lymphocytes stay where they are created so that they cannot move to the muscle and cause inflammation.
3000,"In this trial, researchers were trying to find out if BAF312 lowers CK levels and helps muscle strength in people with PM."
3002,"A placebo looks like a drug, but does not have any medicine in it."
3003,Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the actual effect of the trial drug.
3004,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: Did BAF312 increase muscle strength more than the placebo?"
3005,Did BAF312 lower CK levels in the blood more than the placebo?
3006,Did BAF312 help patients walk more than the placebo?
3007,How much BAF312 got into the blood?
3011,The patients in this trial were 24 to 68 years old and had active PM.
3014,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew which patients took the trial drug or the placebo."
3015,Some trials are done this way because knowing what drug each patient is taking can affect the results of the trial.
3018,"When the sponsor ended the trial early, the sponsor found out which drug patients took in Part 1."
3020,"This means that the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, and the sponsor knew what drug each patient took."
3022,"But the trial ended before any patients who took the placebo in Part 1 began taking 10 milligrams, or mg, of BAF312 in Part 2."
3024,3 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 What happened during the trial?
3025,"Before the trial, trial doctors did a checkup of all patients to make sure they could join the trial."
3026,"Trial doctors: Took blood and urine samples Checked the height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate of each patient Checked the heart of each patient using an electrocardiogram, or ECG Checked lung function and did eye exams Asked patients about their symptoms During the trial, Part 1 lasted 12 weeks: Patients took either 2.0 mg or 10.0 mg of BAF312 or a placebo, once a day."
3027,The treatment was decided randomly using a computer program.
3028,Trial doctors checked lung function and did eye exams and a chest x-ray.
3029,"During the trial, Part 2 lasted 12 weeks: After finishing Part 1, patients could have continued into Part 2."
3030,Patients who took BAF312 in Part 1 continued to take BAF312 at the same dose.
3031,Patients who took the placebo in Part 1 were assigned to take either 2.0 mg or 10.0 mg of BAF312.
3032,The treatment given was decided randomly using a computer program.
3033,Trial doctors checked lung function and did eye exams.
3034,The trial ended before any patients began taking 10.0 mg of BAF312 in Part 2.
3036,Part 1: Double- blind treatment (14 patients) 12 weeks Patients took 1 of the following treatments once a day: 2.0 mg BAF312 10.0 mg BAF312 Placebo Part 2: Open- label treatment (9 patients) 12 weeks Patients who took BAF312 in Part 1 continued to take BAF312 at the same dose.
3038,Follow-up period 4 weeks Patients were followed for 4 weeks after their last dose of trial drug.
3039,Patients had their last check-up on Day 112 (if they stopped after Part 1) or Day 196 (if they stopped after Part 2).
3041,Titration means that patients started with a low dose and increased the dose over 5-10 days of treatment to reach the full dose.
3042,"Throughout the trial, trial doctors measured the muscle strength of patients and checked how well each patient could walk."
3043,"Trial doctors also took blood and urine samples and checked the height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate of patients."
3044,"4 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 The follow-up period lasted 4 weeks: After finishing Part 1 or Part 2 treatment, trial doctors still checked how patients were feeling and if their symptoms were improving for 4 weeks after their last dose."
3045,Patients who stopped after Part 1 of the trial had their last check-up on Day 112.
3046,Patients who stopped after Part 2 of the trial had their last check-up on Day 196.
3053,Did BAF312 increase muscle strength more than the placebo?
3054,"After 12 weeks of treatment, an increase in muscle strength was seen in patients who took 10.0 mg of BAF312 compared to patients who took placebo."
3055,"But, the number of patients in each treatment group was too small for researchers to be confident that BAF312 caused the difference in muscle strength."
3056,No difference in muscle strength was seen in patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312.
3057,"To find out if BAF312 increased muscle strength more than the placebo, trial doctors used a test that looked at how well patients could use different muscles in their body."
3058,"For example, patients were asked to sit in a chair and lift their arm."
3059,The trial doctor then pressed on the arm of the patients.
3061,Trial doctors gave each patient a score based on this test.
3063,"At the end of Part 1 after 12 weeks of treatment, researchers found that: Placebo: Patients who took the placebo had a change of 9.1 points 2.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 had a change of 11.2 points 10.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 10.0 mg of BAF312 had a change of 39.0 points The results seemed to show that, overall, patients who took 10 mg BAF312 had more muscle strength compared to patients who took the placebo."
3064,"But, the number of patients in each treatment group was too small."
3065,"So, the difference between the groups could be due to chance."
3067,Patients who took BAF312 did have lower CK levels in their blood compared to patients who took placebo.
3068,"But, the number of patients in each treatment group was again too small for researchers to be confident that BAF312 lowered CK levels."
3069,"To find out if BAF312 treatment lowered CK levels, researchers took blood samples and measured CK levels in the blood."
3070,Lower CK levels meant less muscle damage.
3071,"At the end of Part 1 after 12 weeks of treatment, researchers found that: Placebo: Patients who took the placebo had 0.5% less CK in the blood 2.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 had 19.7% less CK in the blood 10.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 10.0 mg of BAF312 had 55.6% less CK in the blood 5 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 The results seemed to show that, overall, patients who took BAF312 had lower CK levels in the blood compared to patients who took the placebo."
3072,But the number of patients in each treatment group was too small.
3075,Patients who took BAF312 did walk more than patients who took the placebo.
3076,"But, the number of patients in each treatment group was too small for researchers to be confident that BAF312 helped patients walk more."
3077,"To find out if BAF312 helped patients walk more than the placebo, trial doctors used a test that measured how far patients could walk without help in a 6-minute period."
3078,"The longer the distance was, the better the muscle strength."
3079,"In Part 1, researchers found that: Placebo: Patients who took the placebo walked 6 meters less 2.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 walked 47 meters more 10.0 mg BAF312: Patients who took 10.0 mg of BAF312 walked 23 meters more In Part 2, researchers found that: Placebo in Part 1 and 2.0 mg BAF312 in Part 2: Patients who took the placebo in Part 1 and then 2.0 mg of BAF312 in Part 2 walked 4 meters more 2.0 mg BAF312 in both Part 1 and Part 2: Patients who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 in both Part 1 and Part 2 walked 49 meters more The trial was ended before any patients began taking 10.0 mg of BAF312 in Part 2."
3080,"The results showed that, overall, patients who took BAF312 walked more than patients who took the placebo."
3084,Researchers also wanted to know how much BAF312 got into the blood after treatment.
3085,"Overall, they learned that: On average, BAF312 reached expected levels in the blood after patients took 2.0 mg or 10.0 mg of BAF312."
3090,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
3092,Some patients had adverse events during the trial and 2 patients left the trial because of adverse events.
3093,6 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 The tables below and on the next page show how many patients had adverse events and serious adverse events during each part of the trial.
3094,The tables include all patients who took BAF312 and all patients who took the placebo.
3095,Adverse events in Part 1 Placebo (out of 5 patients) 2.0 mg BAF312 (out of 7 patients) 10.0 mg BAF312 (out of 2 patients) Total (out of 14 patients) How many patients had adverse events in Part 1?

3101,0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Did any patients have serious adverse events?
3104,No patients died during this trial.
3105,"One patient who took 2.0 mg of BAF312 in Part 1 experienced the serious adverse events of severe kidney damage, lowered red blood cell count, and abnormal destruction of red blood cells."
3106,The trial doctors thought these serious adverse events could have been related to the trial treatment.
3107,7 Clinical Trial Results V0.4 What were the most common adverse events?
3108,Headache was the most common adverse event in this trial.
3109,The table below shows the common adverse events that happened in at least 2 patients during Part 1 of this trial.
3110,"Common adverse events in Part 1 Common adverse event Placebo (out of 5 patients) 2.0 mg BAF312 (out of 7 patients) 10.0 mg BAF312 (out of 2 patients) Total (out of 14 patients) Headache 2 (40.0%) 2 (28.6%) 0 (0.0%) 4 (28.6%) Dizziness 2 (40.0%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (50.0%) 3 (21.4%) Upper abdominal pain 1 (20.0%) 1 (14.3%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (14.3%) Nausea 1 (20.0%) 1 (14.3%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (14.3%) During Part 2, the only common adverse event that happened in at least 2 patients was an infection of the nose, throat, and airways."
3111,This happened to 1 patient in the placebo-to-2.0 mg BAF312 group and 1 patient in the 2.0 mg BAF312-to-2.0 mg BAF312 group.
3114,"This summary shows only the main results from this 1 small trial, which ended early."
3115,"Overall, this trial tested BAF312 in a small group of patients with PM."
3117,"So, any differences seen between the groups could be due to chance."
3118,This trial could not show that BAF312 helped with muscle strength.
3119,BAF312 will not be further tested for the treatment of PM.
3121,"Even though BAF312 did not work for PM, the information we learned will help us treat other diseases."

3142,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug CFZ533, also called iscalimab."
3143,"You and all of the patients helped researchers learn more about how CFZ533 works in people with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis, also called MG. Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important to share the results of the trial with you and the public."
3148,You were in this trial for about 1 year.
3149,"But, the entire trial took about 2 years to finish."
3151,The trial started in September 2015 and ended in December 2017.
3152,"The trial included 44 patients from 14 trial sites in Denmark, Germany, Taiwan, Canada, and Russia."
3156,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if CFZ533 works in a small number of patients with moderate to severe MG. Before a drug can be approved for patients to take, researchers do clinical trials to find out how safe it is and how well it works."
3157,The information collected from many clinical trials is needed to find out if CFZ533 improves the health of people with moderate to severe MG. Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: CFZ533 Protocol Number: CCFZ533X2204 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results MG is an immune system disease.
3158,The immune system makes proteins called antibodies to fight anything the body does not recognize.
3159,This is how the body fights infections by bacteria and viruses.
3160,"But sometimes, the immune system makes antibodies that cause it to attack tissues in the body."
3161,"In most patients with MG, antibodies block chemical signals from the nerves to the muscle cells."
3162,This causes muscle weakness and tiredness.
3163,CFZ533 is designed to lower the activity of the immune system.
3164,The researchers in this trial wanted to learn if CFZ533 could help the patients MG symptoms by lowering the activity of the immune system.
3165,"They also wanted to know more about the safety of CFZ533 in patients with moderate to severe MG. To do this, the researchers compared CFZ533 with a placebo."
3168,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did CFZ533 reduce the patients MG symptoms?
3169,Did CFZ533 affect the patients daily lives in other ways?
3170,How else did the patients MG symptoms change during the trial?
3171,How did CFZ533 affect the patients immune systems?
3172,How much CFZ533 stayed in the patients blood?
3175,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with moderate to severe MG."
3176,The patients in this trial were 18 to 74 years old.
3178,"This means none of the patients, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each patient got."
3181,3 Clinical Trial Results A computer program was used to randomly assign the treatment each patient got.
3183,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
3186,"Before treatment started, the trial doctors did tests and checked the health of the patients to make sure they could take part in the trial."
3187,The trial doctors took blood and urine samples from each patient.
3188,"The patients kept taking their usual medicines to treat their MG. During 24 weeks of treatment, the patients got up to 6 doses of trial treatment at the trial site."
3189,The patients got the trial treatment through a needle into a vein.
3190,"During the trial: 22 patients got CFZ533 every 4 weeks 22 patients got the placebo every 4 weeks During this time, the trial staff: checked the overall health of the patients took blood and urine samples asked questions about how the patients felt and about any other medicines they were taking Throughout the trial, the patients kept taking their usual medicines to treat their MG."
3191,"But, the trial doctors may have asked the patients to stop taking certain medicines or take less of them."
3192,"The trial doctors did this to make sure that any effects they saw during the trial were due to the trial treatment, and not due to other reasons."
3193,"After treatment, the patients visited the trial site 7 times for up to 28 weeks."
3194,"At each visit, the trial doctors checked the overall health of the patients."
3195,The trial doctors also checked how the patients were feeling and what medicines they were taking.
3196,The trial doctors took more blood and urine samples from each patient.
3198,During treatment 22 patients got up to 6 doses of CFZ533 22 patients got up to 6 doses of the placebo Doses were given once every 4 weeks After treatment The patients did not get any trial treatment The patients visited the trial site 7 times The patients visited the trial site every 4 weeks Before treatment The trial doctors checked to make sure the patients could join the trial 44 patients joined the trial Up to 4 weeks 24 weeks Up to 28 weeks The patients kept taking their usual medicines to treat MG throughout the trial What were the results of the trial?
3204,All 44 patients got at least 1 dose of trial treatment.
3205,"But, only 34 patients finished the trial."
3206,"So, the results from the 10 patients who did not finish the trial are not shown in all of the results below."
3207,Did CFZ533 reduce the patients MG symptoms?
3208,"After 24 weeks of treatment, patients who got CFZ533 had slightly fewer MG symptoms compared to patients who got the placebo."
3209,"But, the difference between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if CFZ533 reduced the patients MG symptoms."
3210,The trial doctors measured the severity of the patients symptoms before and after 24 weeks of treatment.
3211,"The trial doctors measured this by testing the patients muscles using the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score, also called the QMG score."
3212,A lower score meant that the patient had fewer MG symptoms.
3213,A change in a patient s QMG score that was greater than 3 points meant that there was a noticeable effect on the patient s MG symptoms.
3214,"5 Clinical Trial Results After 24 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that patients who got CFZ533 had a slightly greater decrease in the average QMG score than patients who got the placebo."
3215,The researchers learned that the QMG scores: decreased by an average of 4.1 points in patients who got CFZ533 decreased by an average of 2.9 points in patients who got the placebo The chart below shows the average decrease in QMG score for each treatment group after 24 weeks of treatment.
3216,Average decrease in the patients QMG scores after 24 weeks of treatment CFZ533 Placebo Average change in QMG score (points) 0 2 4 6 8 10 4.1 points decrease 2.9 points decrease Did CFZ533 affect the patients daily lives in other ways?
3217,"Overall, the researchers found that the patients in both treatment groups showed a decrease in how severe their MG symptoms were."
3218,Any difference found between the treatment groups was too small for the researchers to know if CFZ533 affected the patients daily lives.
3219,The researchers wanted to know if CFZ533 affected the patients daily lives in other ways.
3220,"To find out, they measured the effect of CFZ533 on the patients daily lives in 3 different ways."
3221,The table on the next page shows the different measurements.
3222,"For each of these measurements, a lower score meant that there were fewer or less severe MG symptoms."
3223,"6 Clinical Trial Results Measurement Description Completed by Myasthenia Gravis Composite score (also called the MGC ) Measured the signs and symptoms of the patients MG to tell the trial doctors about the patients overall MG status Trial doctor and patient Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (also called the MG ADL ) Measured how well the patients could do certain daily activities Patient 15-Item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life (also called the MG QOL-15 ) Asked the patient about how MG affects their life Patient For each of these measurements, the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if CFZ533 affected the patients daily lives."
3225,"Overall, the patients MG symptoms did not get worse during the trial."
3226,"To find out, the researchers measured the following 5 things: Measurement How it was measured 1."
3227,The patients average QMG scores after they stopped getting trial treatment The researchers measured the QMG scores 24 weeks after the last dose.
3229,The number of patients whose MG symptoms got better The researchers counted how many patients had a decrease of at least 3 points in their average QMG scores throughout the trial.
3231,The number of patients whose MG symptoms got worse The researchers counted how many patients had an increase of at least 3 points in their average QMG scores throughout the trial.
3233,The number of patients who stopped getting treatment because their MG got worse or the treatment was not having an effect The researchers counted the number of patients who had to stop getting treatment for these 2 reasons throughout the trial.
3235,The number of patients who had to return to taking their original dose of steroids The researchers counted how many patients in each treatment group had to return to taking their original dose of steroids throughout the trial.
3236,"7 Clinical Trial Results Measurements 1, 2, and 3."
3237,The researchers found that the first 3 measurements showed slight differences between the treatment groups.
3238,"But, the differences between the treatment groups were too small for the researchers to know if these differences were caused by CFZ533."
3239,Measurement 4.
3240,The researchers found that none of the patients stopped getting treatment because their MG got worse or because the treatment was not having an effect.
3241,Measurement 5.
3242,Steroids are a common treatment for MG.
3243,"But, when steroids are used for a long time, several unwanted effects can happen."
3244,"So, doctors try to limit their use."
3245,"During this trial, the patients could stay on their current steroid treatment for their MG."
3246,"If the trial doctors thought the patients MG symptoms were less severe after 12 weeks of treatment, they could slowly decrease the dose of steroids that each patient took."
3247,"If the patients MG symptoms got worse, the trial doctors could return the patients to their original dose of steroids."
3248,The researchers wanted to know how many patients in each treatment group had to return to taking their original dose of steroids.
3249,"But, not every patient had less severe MG symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment."
3250,"So, the trial doctors could not decrease the dose of steroids that most patients took."
3251,There were so few patients who returned to taking their original dose of steroids that the researchers could not study these results.
3253,The researchers wanted to know if CFZ533 affected the immune system the way it was designed to.
3254,They wanted to find out if CFZ533 blocked an immune system protein called CD40.
3255,CD40 is commonly found on immune system cells called B cells.
3256,The researchers wanted to learn if CFZ533 blocked CD40 on the B cells and lowered the activity of the immune system.
3257,"To find out, they measured: how much total CD40 was on the B cells how much CD40 on the B cells was free to link with other proteins how much CD40 was in the blood Overall, the researchers learned that CFZ533 blocked CD40."
3258,They found that at least 90% of the CD40 on the B cells was blocked.
3259,8 Clinical Trial Results The researchers also wanted to know if the patients immune systems created antibodies against CFZ533.
3260,"Usually, the immune system makes antibodies to fight anything the body does not recognize."
3261,"But sometimes, the immune system makes antibodies against a medicine."
3263,The researchers found that none of the patients who got CFZ533 made antibodies against CFZ533.
3265,The researchers wanted to know how much CFZ533 stayed in the blood of patients who got CFZ533.
3267,"To find out, they measured how much CFZ533 was in the patients blood after 24 weeks of treatment."
3268,"Overall, the researchers found that: the amounts of CFZ533 that stayed in the patients blood were similar to the amounts that researchers observed in earlier trials of CFZ533 CFZ533 reached steady and expected levels in the blood during the 24 weeks of treatment What medical problems did patients have?"
3277,All 44 patients are included in these results because they all got at least 1 dose of trial treatment.
3278,9 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had adverse events?
3279,Most of the patients in this trial had an adverse event.

3333,"A clinical trial to test the drug LFG316 in patients with non-infectious uveitis Overview of results Protocol: CLFG316A2204 In this clinical trial, researchers studied how symptoms of patients with non-infectious uveitis responded to a drug named LFG316."
3334,"Non-infectious uveitis can cause pain and redness in the eye, blurred or loss of vision, eyes that are sensitive to light, and spots in vision (floaters)."
3335,"Non-infectious means the uveitis is not caused by an infection from a virus, bacteria, or fungus."
3337,A clinical trial is a type of research designed to learn more about how our bodies respond to drugs or other treatments.
3339,The researchers wanted to study: If the trial drug LFG316 had an effect on the symptoms of uveitis during and after 85 days of treatment How much LFG316 got into patients bloodstream Who was in this clinical trial?
3340,25 male and female adults with uveitis began this clinical trial.
3342,"This was a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests a trial drug s safety and how well it works in a small number of patients."
3345,"Patients reported adverse events, including 3 serious adverse events."
3346,The doctors at each trial site did not believe LFG316 caused these serious adverse events.
3348,LFG316 did not help the symptoms of non-infectious uveitis.
3350,"Novartis, the sponsor of this clinical trial, thanks the patients who helped make this clinical trial possible."
3351,Clinical Trial Summary 2 Table of Contents What do I need to know about this clinical trial?
3352,2 Why was this clinical trial needed?
3357,11 What do I need to know about this clinical trial?
3358,The researchers that led this clinical trial decided that LFG316 did not cause any changes in the symptoms of uveitis for any patients.
3359,Why was this clinical trial needed?
3360,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat non-infectious uveitis.
3361,"Uveitis is an eye disease that can cause: Pain and redness in the eye (often called inflammation) Blurred or loss of vision that can be permanent Eyes that are sensitive to light Spots, specks, or lines floating in vision (floaters) Non-infectious means the uveitis is not caused by an infection from a virus, bacteria, or fungus."
3362,Researchers think the body s immune system may be a cause of non-infectious uveitis.
3363,The body s immune system is made of cells and proteins that defend the body from illness and infections.
3364,"Sometimes, the immune system can attack the body s healthy cells instead of protecting them."
3365,This can cause inflammation.
3366,Researchers think an immune system protein called C5 may play a role in causing the inflammation and other symptoms of uveitis.
3371,3 Researchers designed this clinical trial to learn if the trial drug LFG316 could lessen the symptoms of uveitis by stopping C5 from signaling the immune system.
3372,"Researchers compared the trial drug to standard treatments that people usually get for uveitis, such as steroids."
3373,The doctor at each clinical trial site decided the standard treatment for each patient.
3374,"In this clinical trial, the researchers wanted to learn: If the trial drug LFG316 had an effect on the symptoms of uveitis during and after 85 days of treatment How much LFG316 got into patients bloodstream About any medical problems, called adverse events, that patients reported Who was in this clinical trial?"
3375,25 adult patients 14 male and 11 female who were 44-years-old on average began this clinical trial.
3376,Researchers planned the main time of treatment to last 85 days for each patient.
3377,All patients in this clinical trial had at least one eye with non-infectious uveitis and were: Between 19 and 76 years of age In good overall health Not being successfully treated for their non-infectious uveitis Taking stronger than usual treatment to try and lower their immune system s activity Patients who received LFG316 in this trial also agreed to lessen or stop the treatment to lower their immune system s activity.
3378,Researchers conducted this trial at 10 health care centers in the United Kingdom and the United States.
3379,"Not all patients completed the trial as planned: 2 patients stopped being part of this clinical trial 3 patients stopped getting LFG316, but still completed visits to the health care center for the clinical trial 23 patients completed the 85-day treatment 4 What type of clinical trial was this?"
3380,"This was a Phase 2 clinical trial, which tests the safety of a trial drug and how well it works in a small number of patients."
3381,This was the first time that researchers tested how well LFG316 works in patients with uveitis.
3382,Researchers also looked for any medical problems that patients had during the study.
3383,Researchers used a computer program to randomly choose the treatment for each patient.
3384,The research staff who tested patients eyes did not know which treatment was given to a patient.
3386,"The patients, some researchers, and the sponsor did know if a patient got a standard treatment or LFG316."
3387,Each patient started at different dates during the trial.
3388,This trial began in December 2012 and ended in August 2017.
3390,Before the trial treatment started Researchers tested patients to make sure they could be in this trial.
3391,Researchers also asked patients to stop or take less of some medicines based on which trial treatment they would be given.
3392,During treatment Researchers gave patients either: LFG316: A total of 3 shots (injections) in one eye.
3393,Researchers gave each patient one shot every 4 weeks.
3394,"Standard treatment: The doctor at each trial site decided which standard treatment, such as steroids, to give each patient."
3395,"During the 85-day long treatment, researchers asked all patients to have both their eyes checked up to 8 different times at the trial health care center."
3396,"Extended treatment At day 85, researchers asked 5 patients who may have responded to LFG316 if they would continue treatment."
3397,4 of the 5 patients continued getting LFG316 for about 6 more months.
3398,This summary reports the main results from participants in the 85-day-long part of this clinical trial.
3399,5 How researchers designed this clinical trial: What did researchers learn in this clinical trial?
3400,"This is a summary of the overall results of this clinical trial, not the individual results of each patient."
3404,Researchers learned LFG316 did not help the symptoms of non-infectious uveitis.
3405,"To find this out, researchers checked patients eyes for: How many letters a patient could read on an eye chart How cloudy the liquid in their eye was How many cells appeared due to inflammation The number of spots or scars on their retina, which is the back part of the eye that is sensitive to light If their uveitis got worse During the trial, researchers found that 2 patients needed more medicine for their uveitis."
3406,"Also during the trial, some patients did not go to all of the planned visits to test their eyes."
3407,"For all patients who did not exactly follow the research plan, researchers cannot tell what caused any changes that happened during the trial."
3408,"After 85 days, some patients had at least 1 change in the symptoms of uveitis, and some had no symptoms of uveitis."
3409,"6 Even though 2 of the 18 patients on LFG316 had almost no symptoms of uveitis at the end of the clinical trial, this was too small of a number of patients for researchers to say that the trial drug worked compared to standard treatments."
3410,"Also, no patient began the clinical trial with all of the symptoms of uveitis."
3411,"Therefore, the researchers decided that LFG316 did not cause any of the changes in the symptoms of uveitis."
3412,Patients who had more than 1 change in the symptoms of uveitis 7 What other key results did researchers learn?
3413,"In this clinical trial, researchers also learned: If LFG316 had effects on patients eyes at any of the visits during the trial Researchers looked at each patient s eyes up to 8 times during the trial to see if there were any effects."
3414,The researchers did not see a difference between patients that got LFG316 and patients that got standard treatments.
3415,How much LFG316 got into patients bloodstream Researchers wanted to know if the trial drug would leave the eye and enter into the patients bloodstream.
3416,"They found small amounts of LFG316 in the blood, but found that it didn t build up or cause any effects."
3417,What medical problems did patients report?
3419,An adverse event is any unwanted sign or symptom that patients report during a trial.
3422,Researchers ask patients to report all adverse events during a trial.
3423,"During the clinical trial, patients reported adverse events, including 3 serious adverse events."
3424,Researchers kept track of the adverse events and whether or not they thought LFG316 was the cause.
3425,Researchers also looked at which adverse events were related to the eye and which were not related to the eye.
3426,5 patients stopped taking LFG316 because of adverse events: 3 patients continued to come to the remaining trial visits 2 patients stopped being part of this clinical trial 8 The percent of patients reporting adverse events during this clinical trial How many serious adverse events happened?
3428,One patient had 3 serious adverse events that were related to the eye.
3429,These were: Retinal detachment: The retina pulls away from where it attaches to the eye Proliferative retinopathy: Damaged and unusual blood vessels around the retina Mycotic endophthalmitis: A fungal infection that causes swelling of the inside of the eye The doctors who led this trial do not believe these serious adverse events were caused by the trial drug.
3430,There were no other serious adverse events reported and none of the patients died during this trial.
3431,9 What were the most common adverse events?
3432,Some patients reported medical problems or adverse events that were not serious.
3433,This section reports only the most common adverse events during this clinical trial.
3435,This summary only lists the adverse events reported by at least 2 of the patients in the trial.
3436,"The most common adverse events related to the eye were: Conjunctival hemorrhage (spots of blood on the white of the eye) Uveitis (that got worse than before) Higher pressure in the eye Dry eye Macular fibrosis (scars on the eye s macula, an area in the center of the retina) The most common adverse events not related to the eye were: Headache Common cold or a similar infection The percent of patients reporting at least 2 adverse events in the eye 10 The percent of patients reporting at least 2 adverse events not in the eye How has this clinical trial helped?"
3437,Researchers learned that LFG316 did not affect the symptoms of non-infectious uveitis.
3438,The results of this clinical trial helped researchers understand more about LFG316 and the role of the immune system with non-infectious uveitis.
3441,The results of many trials are needed to find out which treatments can be used for patients with non-infectious uveitis.

3478,You were in this trial for up to 9 months.
3479,"But, the entire trial took 1 year to finish."
3481,The trial started in April 2016 and ended in April 2017.
3482,The trial included 15 patients from 3 trial sites in Germany and the United States.
3485,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: CFZ533 Protocol #: CCFZ533X2205 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
3486,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have GD.
3488,This information is important to know before other trials can be done to find out if CFZ533 improves the health of people with GD.
3489,GD is an immune system disease that affects the thyroid gland.
3490,The thyroid gland makes proteins called hormones.
3491,Thyroid hormones control things like how fast the heart beats and how fast calories are burned.
3492,"In people with GD, the immune system attacks the thyroid and causes it to make higher than normal levels of thyroid hormones."
3493,High levels of thyroid hormones in the blood can lead to serious medical problems.
3494,CFZ533 was designed to lower the activity of the immune system.
3495,The researchers in this trial wanted to learn if CFZ533 could lower the activity of the immune system in patients with GD enough to help their thyroid make normal levels of thyroid hormones.
3496,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if CFZ533 works in a small number of patients with GD."
3497,"Other treatments for GD are available, but they can have harmful long term effects, or the GD can come back."
3498,"So, researchers are looking for a better way to treat GD."
3499,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did the patients thyroid hormones reach normal levels after taking CFZ533?
3502,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with GD."
3503,The patients in this trial were 21 to 65 years old.
3510,"The trial doctors also checked the heart health of the patients using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG."
3511,The trial doctors asked patients to stop taking certain medicines.
3512,This helped the researchers make sure any effects they saw during the treatment part of the trial were due to the trial drug and not due to other medicines.
3513,"During treatment, the patients got a total of 5 doses of CFZ533 at the trial site over about 12 weeks."
3514,The dose each patient got was based on his or her body weight.
3515,"Doses were measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight, also called mg/kg."
3516,All the patients got 10 mg of CFZ533 for every kg of their body weight.
3517,They got the trial drug through a needle into a vein.
3518,"Throughout the trial, the trial staff: Checked the overall health of the patients Took blood and urine samples Asked questions about how the patients felt and about any other medicines they were taking After treatment, the patients visited the trial site another 5 times over 20 weeks."
3519,"At each visit, the trial doctors checked the overall health and heart health of the patients."
3523,Before treatment Up to 4 weeks 15 patients joined the trial The patients got 5 doses of CFZ533 Treatment After treatment 20 weeks12 weeks The patients did not get any CFZ533 The patients visited the trial site another 5 times What were the results of the trial?
3524,"This is a summary of the overall results of this trial, not your individual results."
3530,"During the trial, 2 patients got rescue medicine."
3531,This is medicine that patients could get if they needed urgent help for their GD symptoms.
3532,"In these patients, the researchers could not be sure if the effects seen during the trial were caused by the trial drug or the rescue medicine."
3533,"So, the researchers did not include these 2 patients in some of the results."
3534,Did the patients thyroid hormones reach normal levels after taking CFZ533?
3535,The researchers wanted to know if CFZ533 affected how the patients thyroids worked.
3536,"To find this out, the researchers counted the number of patients whose thyroid hormones reached a normal range after 12 weeks of treatment."
3537,"To do this, the trial doctors measured 3 thyroid hormones that are found in the blood."
3538,"If these hormones reached normal levels, it meant that the patients thyroids were working normally."
3539,"The researchers measured the thyroid hormones called TSH, T3, and T4."
3540,The researchers measured these thyroid hormones throughout the trial.
3541,"5 Clinical Trial Results After 12 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that: None of the patients had their TSH reach normal levels."
3542,38.5% of the patients had their T3 reach normal levels.
3543,This was 5 out of 13 patients.
3544,30.8% of the patients had their T4 reach normal levels.
3545,This was 4 out of 13 patients.
3546,The chart below shows the percentage of patients who had their thyroid hormones reach normal levels after 12 weeks.
3547,"0 20 60 80 100 Percentage of patients whose thyroid hormones reached normal levels 0% TSH 38.5% T3 30.8% T4 Pe rc en ta ge o f p at ie nt s (% ) 40 After treatment ended, the researchers continued to check the thyroid hormone levels of all 15 patients."
3548,"The researchers learned that: In 7 out of 15 patients, at least 1 of the thyroid hormones reached normal levels after 24 weeks."
3549,This was 12 weeks after the last dose of CFZ533.
3550,Two out of 15 patients had normal levels of TSH by week 24.
3552,TSH can take at least 2-3 months longer than the other thyroid hormones to reach normal levels after treatment.
3564,Adverse events in this trial How many patients in this trial had adverse events?

3568,One patient experienced the serious adverse event of rapid heart rate.
3569,This was 6.7% of patients.
3570,The doctors thought this serious adverse event was caused by the patient s GD.
3571,Rapid heart rate is common in patients who have GD.
3574,Inflammation of the bladder or urinary tract was the most common adverse event in this trial.
3575,The table below shows the most common adverse events that happened in 10.0% or more of patients.

3618,Results Summary | 2 How long was this trial?
3619,This trial was designed so that an individual participant could take part for close to 11 months.
3620,The trial started in July 2015 and ended in June 2017.
3621,"The entire duration, from enrolling the first participant to the last participant completing the trial, was close to 2 years."
3622,The researchers completed this trial as planned.
3623,"When the trial ended, the researchers collected information on the trial treatments (QGE031, omalizumab, and placebo) and created a report of the trial results."
3624,This summary is based on that report.
3626,"Researchers were looking for a better way to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria, also known as CSU."
3627,People affected with CSU develop hives and itch that appear suddenly without an obvious cause.
3628,"Hives are swollen, itchy, pale red bumps on the skin."
3629,"For the hives to be classified as chronic, they need to last longer than 6 weeks and appear without any warning in an unpredictable way."
3630,"CSU is a type of allergic disease in which the body's immune system becomes active and produces itchy hives, even when there is no known cause or trigger."
3631,"A type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, also known as IgE, is thought to play a major part in the condition of CSU."
3632,"Trial drugs The drugs given in this trial were: QGE031, also known as ligelizumab, blocks the effect of the IgE antibody."
3633,"QGE031 is not yet available to the public, so it can only be used in a research trial such as this one."
3634,Three different strengths of QGE031 were studied in this trial.
3635,Omalizumab stops IgE from working in a similar way to QGE031.
3636,It is available to the public to treat CSU.
3637,"Placebo, which looks like the trial drug, does not have any medicine in it."
3638,It helps researchers better understand the effect of a trial drug.
3639,"Throughout the trial, the participants were allowed to continue taking the CSU medicines that they were already taking."
3640,They were also given extra doses of anti-histamine medicine when needed to manage episodes of increased hives and itch.
3641,This medicine was known as rescue medicine.
3642,Trial purpose This trial was done to learn more about the effects and safety of QGE031.
3643,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Results Summary | 3 How many participants had complete relief from hives at week 12 (close to 3 months after the first dose)?
3644,"The researchers collected this information for 3 different strengths of QGE031, one strength of omalizumab, and placebo."
3645,What medical problems did the participants have during this trial?
3647,"The participants could take part in this trial if: they were between 18 and 75 years of age, they had CSU for longer than 6 months, their CSU was difficult to manage with the medicines they were already taking, and they did not have any major disease(s) that made them unsuitable for participation in the trial."
3648,A total of 382 participants from 10 countries participated in this trial.
3649,"The participants were enrolled in trial sites in Australia, Canada, Germany, Greece, Japan, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America."
3650,The average age of participants was 43 years.
3651,Participants age ranged from 18 to 74 years.
3652,The majority of participants were female (286 out of 382; which is 75% of the trial participants).
3654,This trial is called a double-blind trial.
3655,"This means that none of the participants, trial doctors, or trial staff knew what treatment participants were receiving."
3657,Doing a trial this way helps to make sure that the results are looked at with fairness towards all treatments.
3658,Results Summary | 4 What happened during this trial?
3659,"At the start of the trial, the researchers randomly assigned the participants to receive: 24 milligram (mg) of QGE031, 72 mg of QGE031, 240 mg of QGE031, 300 mg of omalizumab, or placebo, or 120 mg of QGE031 given once and then placebo given once every 4 weeks."
3660,The researchers studied this particular treatment to see how long QGE031 was in the body and how long its effect lasted.
3661,"During the treatment period of 20 weeks (close to 5 months), participants received a total of 10 injections over 5 visits."
3662,"At each visit, all participants were given 2 injections under the skin in either the arm, the thigh, or the lower part of the stomach."
3663,Each visit was 4 weeks apart.
3664,"which were given once every 4 weeks Results Summary | 5 After completing the treatment, the participants visited the trial site 6 times."
3665,"At each visit, the researchers observed the participants general health and looked to see if their hives or itch reappeared."
3666,Each visit was scheduled 4 weeks apart.
3667,All participants (including those who received omalizumab or placebo) were given the option to enter another trial on QGE031 three months after completing the treatment.
3668,"In this other trial, all participants received treatment with QGE031."
3669,The researchers asked the participants to record their CSU symptoms twice a day in an electronic diary.
3670,They also tracked participants health throughout the trial.
3671,What were the key results of this trial?
3672,This is a summary of the average results for all participants for different treatment groups.
3673,It does not show the results of each individual participant.
3674,Results of individual participants could be different from the results of the total group of participants.
3675,A detailed presentation of the results can be found on the websites listed at the end of this summary.
3676,How many participants had complete relief from hives at week 12?
3677,The researchers asked participants to record the number of hives they had twice a day.
3678,The researchers found that QGE031 helped to control hives in participants with CSU.
3679,"Participants who were given QGE031 every 4 weeks were more likely to have no hives compared to: participants who were given omalizumab, participants who were given QGE031 only once in the trial, or participants who were given placebo."
3680,The researchers found that the results for participants who were given 240 mg of QGE031 and 72 mg of QGE031 were similar.
3681,"Similarly, the researchers found that QGE031 helped in controlling itch."
3682,The percentage of participants who had no hives at week 12 (close to 3 months after the first dose) in each treatment group is shown in the diagram below.
3683,Results Summary | 6 What medical problems did the participants have during the trial?
3685,An adverse event is an unwanted sign or symptom that participants have during a trial.
3686,"An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems or the participant needs hospital care."
3689,"During a trial, all adverse events are recorded, whether or not they are thought to be caused by the trial drug."
3690,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all adverse events participants have."

3728,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug LFX453.
3729,You helped researchers learn if LFX453 works in people with actinic keratosis.
3730,This trial started in March 2015 and ended in January 2016.
3734,"If you have questions about the results, please speak with the trial doctor or other trial staff at your trial site."
3735,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: LFX453 Protocol #: CLFX453X2201 Full Trial Title: A randomized, vehicle controlled, active comparator, parallel group study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of topical LFX453 formulations in patients with actinic keratosis Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: March 2015 to January 2016 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
3736,"You were in this trial for about 6 months, but the trial took close to 1 year to complete."
3737,"The trial included 82 patients from 10 trial sites in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, and the United Kingdom."
3741,"Researchers were looking for a better way to treat actinic keratosis, also called AK."
3742,"People with AK have thick, scaly patches of skin that can feel rough or dry."
3743,These patches are also called lesions.
3744,The lesions can appear on areas of the skin that have been exposed to a lot of sun or ultraviolet (UV) rays.
3745,"In this trial, researchers wanted to find out if the trial drug LFX453 can work with the body s immune system to help clear AK lesions."
3746,Researchers compared LFX453 with imiquimod and a placebo.
3747,"Imiquimod, also known as Aldara , is currently available to treat AK."
3749,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: Did lesions completely clear in more patients who got LFX453 compared to patients who got the placebo?"
3750,How much LFX453 got into the blood and how much was found in the skin?
3753,"The patients in this trial were 51 to 76 years old and had AK with lesions on their face, scalp, or both."
3756,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were getting LFX453 or the placebo."
3759,"Additionally, some patients got imiquimod and they were in an open-label part of the trial."
3760,"This means that the patients, some trial doctors, and sponsor staff knew which patients were getting imiquimod."
3761,"However, the medical staff that looked at each patient s skin did not know which treatment the patient got."
3762,This meant the results were looked at fairly.
3763,"3 Clinical Trial Results When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out what all the patients got so they could create a report of the trial results."
3765,"Before the trial started, the trial doctors did tests and asked about patients AK symptoms to make sure they could join the trial."
3766,"During the trial, patients got one of the below study treatments for up to 8 weeks."
3767,"Patients were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to get either: LFX453 Cream 1 LFX453 Cream 2 A placebo that looked like LFX453 Cream 1 A placebo that looked like LFX453 Cream 2 Imiquimod (Aldara ) The chart below shows how many patients got each treatment."
3768,"Treatment: 82 Patients 20 patients got LFX453 Cream 1 twice a day 20 patients got LFX453 Cream 2 twice a day 11 patients got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 1 twice a day 10 patients got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 2 twice a day 21 patients got imiquimod 3 times a week Patients were given 1 of the treatments for 4 weeks, took a break for 4 weeks, and then got the same treatment again for another 4 weeks."
3769,"If patients had their lesions completely clear after the first 4 weeks of treatment, then their treatment stopped."
3770,"At each trial site visit, the trial doctors did tests and checked the number of patients skin lesions to see how well the creams were working."
3771,They did this by taking pictures and looking at the patients skin.
3772,"After treatment ended, patients had a final check-up 8 weeks later."
3773,"4 Clinical Trial Results The figure below shows how the trial was done and how often each treatment was applied to the skin: Follow-upTreatment Patients got 1 treatment for 4 weeks, took a break for 4 weeks, then got the same treatment again for another 4 weeks."
3774,"If patients lesions completely cleared after the rst 4 weeks of treatment, then their treatment stopped."
3775,Patients had a nal check-up 8 weeks after treatment ended (week 20).
3776,Week 4 Treatment Treatment Skin lesions were checked Break from treatment Week 8 Week 12 Week 16 Week 20 What were the results of the trial?
3782,Did lesions completely clear in more patients who got LFX453 compared to patients who got the placebo?
3784,"Overall, the results did not show that lesions cleared more often in patients who got LFX453 compared to patients who got the placebo."
3785,Any differences between the treatment groups could have been due to chance.
3786,"When researchers looked at patients 8 weeks after treatment ended (week 20), they found that 1 of the 20 patients (5.0%) in each of the LFX453 groups and 1 out of the 21 patients (4.8%) in the 2 placebo groups had their lesions completely clear."
3787,"In the imiquimod group, 13 of the 21 patients (61.9%) had their lesions completely clear at 8 weeks after treatment ended."

3795,9 of the 21 patients (42.9%) who got imiquimod had their lesions completely clear.
3796,6 Clinical Trial Results How much LFX453 got into the blood and how much was found in the skin?
3797,Researchers wanted to know how much LFX453 got into the blood and how much stayed in the skin.
3798,They found the following: Patients who got LFX453 Cream 1 or Cream 2 had very little LFX453 in their blood.
3799,The amount of LFX453 found in the blood was similar in patients that got Cream 1 and Cream 2.
3800,"Within a week of getting either Cream 1 or Cream 2, LFX453 reached steady amounts in patients blood."
3801,Patients who got Cream 1 had about 2 times more LFX453 in their skin compared to patients who got Cream 2.
3802,The amount of LFX453 in patients skin was 6 times higher than the average amount of LFX453 in patients blood.
3809,Some patients in each treatment group had adverse events.
3810,Slightly more patients in the imiquimod group had adverse events compared to the other treatment groups.

3820,"In this trial, there were 6 serious adverse events that happened in 5 patients: 1 patient who got LFX453 Cream 1 had depression that got worse."
3821,"1 patient who got LFX453 Cream 2 had an abdominal hernia, or bulging of the stomach through a weakness in the abdominal wall muscle."
3822,1 patient who got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 1 had an irregular or quick heartbeat as well as a stroke.
3823,1 patient who got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 2 had diarrhea that got worse.
3824,1 patient who got imiquimod had a fracture at the top of the thigh bone.
3825,The trial doctors did not think any of the serious adverse events were related to the drugs used in this trial.
3826,What were the most common side effects?
3827,"Researchers also looked at the most common adverse events caused by the trial drugs, also known as side effects ."
3828,The most common side effect was redness of the skin where the treatment was given.

3849,Thank you to the patients who took part in the clinical trial for the treatment HSC835.
3850,The patients helped researchers learn how HSC835 works in people with blood cancer.
3851,Novartis sponsored this trial and thinks it is important for them to know the results of this trial.
3853,We hope it helps the patients understand and feel proud of their important role in medical research.
3854,"If the patients have questions about the results, they should speak with the doctor, research nurse, or other team member at the trial site."
3855,What s happened since the trial ended?
3856,"The patients were in this trial for about 1 year, but the trial took almost 2 years to complete."
3858,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Treatment Studied: HSC835 Protocol #: CHSC835X2202 Full Trial Title: A single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of infusing HSC835 in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing UCB transplantation using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: October 2014 to August 2016 V0.5 2 Clinical Trial Results V0.5 The trial included 9 patients from 1 trial site in the United States."
3862,The researchers were looking for a better way to treat blood cancer.
3863,One common treatment for blood cancer is to give patients blood stem cell transplants.
3864,The blood stem cells can be taken from bone marrow or from umbilical cord blood.
3865,A blood stem cell can turn into all the common types of cells normally found in the blood.
3866,Sometimes doctors cannot always find stem cells from bone marrow that are a safe match for the patient.
3867,"In this case, umbilical cord blood may be used."
3868,But the amount of stem cells from 1 unit of umbilical cord blood may not be enough to help treat a patient with blood cancer.
3869,Often patients need more stem cells in order to recover from the transplant quickly enough.
3870,So researchers are looking for new ways to help speed up the patient s recovery.
3871,The researchers in this trial wanted to learn whether a treatment called HSC835 could help patients with blood cancer recover from the transplant faster.
3872,"In this treatment, some of the cells from the umbilical cord blood are grown in the laboratory to increase the number of blood stem cells."
3873,"Because the HSC835 treatment has more blood stem cells, only 1 unit of umbilical cord blood is needed for the transplant."
3874,In this trial the researchers wanted to know: How many patients had successful transplants?
3875,How many patients grew new blood cells?
3876,How many patients died for reasons other than their cancer?
3877,How many patients lived for at least 1 year after getting HSC835?
3879,"To answer these questions, the researchers asked for the help of people with blood cancer."
3880,The patients in this trial were men and women who were 29 to 70 years old and had blood cancer.
3881,3 Clinical Trial Results V0.5 What kind of trial was this?
3882,This trial was open-label .
3883,"This means that the patients, doctors, staff, and the sponsor knew what each patient got."
3884,"In this trial, all patients got HSC835."
3886,Before the trial started the doctors did a full checkup of all patients to make sure they could join the trial.
3887,"The doctors did a physical exam, took blood and urine samples, did other tests, and checked the lung and heart health of the patients."
3888,The doctors also asked the patients questions about any medical problems and other drugs that the patients were taking.
3889,This trial had 2 stages.
3890,All of the patients went through both stages.
3891,During both stages they took medicine to lower their immune system.
3892,These medicines helped make sure the immune system did not reject the transplanted stem cells.
3893,Stage 1 lasted 6 days.
3894,"During this stage each patient got chemotherapy, radiation therapy to help treat their blood cancer."
3895,Stage 2 lasted about 1 year.
3896,"During this stage, each patient got HSC835 on Day 1 through an infusion."
3897,An infusion is the delivery of a liquid drug into the body through a vein at a controlled rate.
3898,The patients were followed for 1 year to see how well they were doing after the transplant and how they were feeling.
3900,Open-Label Trial Stage 1: 6 days All patients got: Chemotherapy and radiation therapy Medicine to lower the immune system Stage 2: About 1 year All patients: Got HSC835 through an infusion on Day 1 Continued to take medicine to lower the immune system Were then followed for 1 year What were the results of the trial?
3901,"This is a summary of the overall results of this trial, not individual patient results."
3904,4 Clinical Trial Results V0.5 Other trials may provide new information or different results.
3905,Patients should not make changes to their treatment based on the results of a single trial without first talking to their doctor.
3907,How many patients had successful transplants?
3908,All 9 of the patients had successful transplants of HSC835.
3909,The transplant was successful if the patient did not have a graft failure .
3910,Graft failure means the body rejected the stem cells that were transplanted.
3911,None of the patients had graft failure 42 days after getting the transplant.
3913,The transplanted blood stem cells can turn into all the common types of cells normally found in the blood.
3914,All 9 of the patients grew new blood cells after the HSC835 transplant.
3915,The researchers wanted to know if the patients grew a certain kind of blood cell called a neutrophil .
3916,All of the patients had neutrophils grow in their blood from the transplanted blood stem cells within 42 days of the transplant.
3918,The researchers wanted to know how many patients died during the trial for reasons other than blood cancer.
3919,The reasons could have been because of the transplant or something else.
3920,None of the patients died in the first 100 days after getting the transplant for reasons other than their cancer.
3921,One patient (11.1%) died within 1 year of getting the transplant for reasons other than their cancer.
3922,This was 1 of the 9 patients.
3924,The researchers wanted to know how many patients lived for at least 1 year before dying for any reason.
3925,They also wanted to know how many patients did not have their cancer come back.
3926,55.6% of the patients were alive 1 year after getting the HSC835 transplant.
3927,This was 5 of the 9 patients.
3928,44.4% did not have their cancer come back 1 year after getting the HSC835 transplant.
3929,This was 4 of the 9 patients.
3930,5 Clinical Trial Results V0.5 What medical problems did patients have?
3938,"Overall, all 9 patients (100.0%) had adverse events during the trial."
3940,Adverse events in this trial Time from transplant until 48 hours after transplant Total (Out of 9 patients) Time from Day 3 to the end of the trial Total (Out of 9 patients) How many patients had adverse events?

3944,"During the 1 year trial period, 44.4% of the patients died."
3945,This was 4 out of the 9 patients.
3946,3 patients died within 1 year of getting HSC835 because their cancer came back.
3947,1 patient died because of acute graft versus host disease.
3948,"In this disease, the transplanted blood stem cells attack the body."
3949,The doctors did not think any of the deaths were related to HSC835 treatment.
3950,6 Clinical Trial Results V0.5 None of the patients had serious adverse events during the first 48 hours after getting HSC835.
3951,"From Day 3 after the transplant to the end of the trial, all 9 patients had serious adverse events."
3952,The serious adverse event that happened the most often was acute graft versus host disease.
3953,The table below shows the most common serious adverse events that happened to at least 2 patients from Day 3 to the end of the trial.
3954,Other serious adverse events happened in fewer total patients.
3955,"Most common serious adverse events from Day 3 to end of the trial Serious adverse event Total (Out of 9 patients) Acute graft versus host disease (when the transplanted stem cells attack the body soon after the transplant) 66.7% (6) Intestinal infection due to C. difficile bacteria 22.2% (2) Pneumonia 22.2% (2) Aspiration pneumonia (infection caused by breathing in food, drink, vomit, or saliva into the lungs) 22.2% (2) What were the most common non-serious adverse events?"

3982,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug QVA149.
3983,"You and all of the patients helped researchers learn more about how QVA149 works in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD."
3989,You were in the trial for up to 9 weeks.
3990,"But, the whole trial took about 15 months to finish."
3992,The trial started in June 2016 and ended in September 2017.
3993,The trial included 31 patients in the United Kingdom.
3997,"Patients with COPD have swelling in their lungs, including in the small airways."
3998,"The swelling causes the airways to tighten, which decreases airflow in and out of the lungs."
3999,"So, not all parts of the lungs get air."
4001,The lung damage makes it even harder to breathe.
4002,"Researchers think the small airways are the first part of the lungs to be damaged in COPD, and where most of the damage occurs."
4003,"Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: QVA149 Protocol Number: CQVA149A2325 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results At the time of the trial, QVA149 was being used by doctors in several countries to treat COPD."
4004,QVA149 is taken through an inhaler.
4005,It helps relax and expand the airways of the lungs.
4006,This can help patients with COPD breathe easier.
4007,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to learn more about how QVA149 works in the small airways of the lungs."
4008,They also wanted to learn if patients had any medical problems during the trial.
4009,"To find out, the researchers compared QVA149 to a placebo."
4012,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did more of the lungs get air when patients took QVA149?
4013,Which parts of the patients lungs got more air when they took QVA149?
4014,Did QVA149 change how much blood flowed through the patients lungs?
4015,Did QVA149 change how easily the patients could breathe?
4016,Did QVA149 help the patients lungs work more evenly?
4018,"To answer the questions in this trial, researchers asked for the help of patients with COPD who had smoked at least 10 pack-years."
4019,A pack-year is equal to smoking 1 pack a day for 1 year.
4020,The men and women in the trial were 53 to 76 years old when they joined.
4023,"This means none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew what treatment each patient took."
4025,"When the trial ended, the sponsor found out which treatment patients took so they could create a report of the results."
4027,This was also a crossover trial.
4028,"In a crossover trial, all patients take each of the treatments, but they take them in a different order with a break in between."
4029,The patients in this trial took both QVA149 and a placebo.
4030,3 Clinical Trial Results The researchers used a computer program to randomly choose the treatment each patient took and the order that each patient took the treatment.
4031,This helped make sure that comparing the results of the treatments was as fair as possible.
4034,"In each part, each patient got QVA149 or the placebo."
4035,"By the end of the trial, each patient had taken both treatments."
4036,"Before the treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure patients could take part in the trial."
4037,This part lasted up to 3 weeks.
4038,"The trial doctors: checked the patients breathing and COPD symptoms and overall health took blood and urine samples from the patients took pictures of the patients lungs using high-resolution computed tomography, also called a CT scan took pictures of the patients lungs using magnetic resonance imaging, also called an MRI checked the patients heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG Patients had to stop taking certain medicines in order to be in the trial."
4039,This was done to find out if patients could be off these medicines long enough for the doctors to do certain tests.
4040,"If a patient could go without certain medicines for 1 week, then the patient could participate in the rest of the trial."
4041,"The patients could take rescue medicine during that week, if needed."
4042,Rescue medicine is medicine that patients could take if they needed to treat their COPD symptoms right away.
4043,This medicine was taken through an inhaler.
4044,The patients used a diary to keep track of when they took the rescue medicine.
4045,"During treatment, the trial doctors: checked the patients blood pressure and heart rate took pictures of the patients lungs using an MRI checked the patients breathing and COPD symptoms asked the patients about any other medicines they were taking and how they were feeling 4 Clinical Trial Results The patients continued to go without certain medicines during this time."
4046,This helped the researchers make sure that the effects they saw during treatment were due to the trial drug and not due to other reasons.
4047,"The patients could take rescue medicine during treatment, if needed."
4048,They used a diary to keep track of when they took rescue medicine and when they took the trial treatment.
4049,"In both parts of the trial, the patients took the trial treatment through an inhaler once a day for 8 to 10 days."
4050,There were 1 to 2 weeks between Part 1 and Part 2.
4051,"During this time, the patients did not take the trial treatment."
4052,The researchers did this to make sure any effects they saw during each part were due to the treatment taken in that part.
4053,"During Part 1 of the trial: 16 patients took QVA149 15 patients took the placebo During Part 2 of the trial: 15 patients took QVA149 14 patients took the placebo After treatment ended, the patients visited their trial site 1 more time within 7 days of their last dose."
4054,"At this visit, the trial doctors: checked the patients blood pressure and heart rate checked the patients heart health using an ECG asked how the patients were feeling and about any other medicines they were taking The chart below shows how the trial was done."
4055,Before treatment Up to about 4 weeks The trial doctors checked that patients could join the trial The patients may have been asked to stop taking certain medicines for about 1 week During treatment Part 1 31 patients took either QVA149 or the placebo Part 2 29 patients took either QVA149 or the placebo After treatment Up to 1 week The patients visited their trial site 1 final time About 4 weeks 8 to 10 days The patients did not take any trial treatment for 1 to 2 weeks between Part 1 and Part 2 8 to 10 days 5 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
4061,All 31 patients finished their treatment with QVA149.
4062,"But, only 28 patients had results from when they took the placebo that the researchers could use."
4063,"So, 3 patients are not included in some of the results for the placebo below."
4064,"This is because these patients either did not finish their treatment with the placebo, or their results were incomplete."
4065,Did more of the lungs get air when patients took QVA149?
4067,The researchers found that more of the lungs got air when the patients took QVA149 compared with when they took the placebo.
4068,"In patients with COPD, air cannot reach all parts of the lungs."
4069,The researchers wanted to learn if QVA149 increased how much of the patients lungs got air.
4070,"To find out, the trial doctors took pictures of the patients lungs before and after 1 week of treatment."
4071,They did this using an MRI.
4072,An MRI scan is a way to take pictures of the inside of the body.
4073,The trial doctors gave the patients a gas to breathe in during the MRI that would show up in the pictures.
4074,"Where the trial doctors saw the gas in the picture, they knew air had reached that part of the lungs."
4075,The trial doctors could then measure the percentage of the patients lungs that got air.
4076,"The researchers found that after 1 week of treatment, the average overall percentage of the lungs that got air was: 61.7% when the patients took QVA149 56.7% when the patients took the placebo 6 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows the average overall percentage of the patients lungs that got air."
4077,Percentage of the patients lungs that got air QVA149 (out of 31 patients) Placebo (out of 28 patients) Pe rc en ta ge o f t he lu ng s (% ) 0 25 50 75 100 61.7% 56.7% Which parts of the patients lungs got more air when they took QVA149?
4078,The lungs are made up of 5 different parts.
4079,The left lung has an upper and lower part.
4080,"The right lung has an upper, middle, and lower part."
4081,Each of these different parts has their own air and blood supply.
4082,The graphic below shows the 5 parts of the lungs.
4083,Right upper part Left upper part Right middle part Right lower part Left lower part 7 Clinical Trial Results The researchers wanted to learn which parts of the lungs were able to take up more air after 1 week of treatment.
4084,"To find out, they took pictures of the patients lungs with an MRI before and after 1 week of treatment."
4085,They gave the patients a gas to breathe during the MRI that would show up in the pictures.
4087,The trial doctors could then measure which parts of the lungs were able to take up more air.
4088,"The researchers found that compared with taking the placebo, some parts of patients lungs took up more air when the patients took QVA149."
4089,These parts were: the left upper part of the lungs the left lower part of the lungs the right upper part of the lungs Did QVA149 change how much blood flowed through the patients lungs?
4091,"Overall, QVA149 did not change how much blood flowed through the patients lungs."
4092,Patients with COPD can have decreased blood flow in the small airways of the lungs.
4093,The researchers wanted to know if QVA149 changed how much blood flowed through the patients lungs.
4094,"To find out, the researchers measured how much blood flowed through the lungs after 1 week of treatment."
4095,"To do this, the trial doctors took pictures of the patients lungs before and after 1 week of treatment."
4096,They did this with an MRI.
4097,"Before the MRI, the trial doctors gave the patients a substance through a needle into a vein."
4098,The MRI can show this substance to track blood flow in the lungs.
4099,The researchers found that the difference in blood flow between the 2 treatment groups was too small to know if QVA149 changed how much blood flowed through the lungs.
4102,"Overall, patients could breathe more easily when taking QVA149 compared with taking the placebo."
4103,"8 Clinical Trial Results To find this out, the researchers measured 3 things after 1 week of treatment: the amount of air the patients breathed out in 1 second the total amount of air the patients could breathe out how much air the patients breathed out in 1 second as a percentage of the total air they could breathe out An increase in these amounts meant that the patients could breathe more easily."
4104,"On average, the researchers found that QVA149 increased all 3 amounts when the patients took QVA149 more than when the patients took the placebo."
4106,"To try to answer this question, the researchers used a test that measured how evenly air got in and out of the lungs."
4108,This test was done both before the patients took the first dose and after 1 week of treatment.
4109,The trial doctors gave each patient a score based on this test.
4110,Lower scores meant that the patient s lungs worked more evenly.
4111,Researchers often look for new ways to test how a drug is acting in patients bodies.
4112,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to learn if the lung clearance index would be a good way to measure how air got in and out of the lungs."
4113,The researchers found that the test did not give clear results.
4114,The researchers were not able to say if QVA149 helped the patients lungs work more evenly.
4115,The difference in scores when patients took QVA149 compared to when they took the placebo was too small for the researchers to know if QVA149 helped the patients lungs work more evenly.
4121,9 Clinical Trial Results These problems may or may not be caused by the trial drug.
4127,There were 16.1% of the patients who had adverse events while taking QVA149.
4128,This was 5 patients.
4129,There were 12.9% of the patients who had adverse events while taking the placebo.
4130,This was 4 patients.
4131,There were 6.5% of the patients who had serious adverse events while taking the placebo.
4132,This was 2 patients.
4133,None of the patients had serious adverse events while taking QVA149.
4134,There was 1 patient who left the study because of an adverse event right after the patient finished taking QVA149.
4135,There was 1 patient who stopped taking the placebo because they had an adverse event.
4136,The trial doctors did not think these adverse events were caused by the trial treatment.
4137,This was 3.2% of patients in each treatment group.
4138,The table below shows how many patients had adverse events during both parts of this trial.

4143,There were 2 serious adverse events that happened during this trial.
4144,These happened to the patients while they were taking the placebo.
4145,These serious adverse events were irregular heart rate and leg bone fracture at the hip.
4146,The trial doctors thought that the serious adverse event of irregular heart rate could have been caused by the trial treatment.
4147,"At the time that the patient had an irregular heartbeat, the trial doctors did not know that the patient was taking the placebo."
4150,The most common adverse events during this trial were COPD getting worse and a wet cough.
4151,"Each of these events happened in 6.5% of patients, which was 2 out of 31 patients."
4152,The table below shows all the adverse events that happened during this trial.

4155,The information described above helped the researchers better understand how QVA149 affects the small airways of the lungs in patients with COPD who have smoked at least 10 pack-years.
4157,The results of many trials are needed to find out which treatments can be used for patients with COPD.
4158,This summary shows only the main results from this one trial in a small number of patients.

4193,Clinical Trial RESULTS Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: BGS649 National Clinical Trial #: NCT01200862 Protocol #: CBGS649A2204 Study Date: August 2010 to August 2012 2 Clinical Trial RESULTS WHAT S HAPPENED SINCE MY TRIAL ENDED?
4194,You were in the trial for up to 12 weeks.
4195,"However, the entire trial took much longer."
4196,"It took 2 years for the trial to finish, because some patients started the trial later than others."
4197,The trial had 29 participants at 2 sites in the U.S.
4198,"When the trial ended in August 2012, the sponsor reviewed all the data and created a report of the results."
4201,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat obesity-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (OHH).
4202,OHH is a medical condition in which the naturally occurring sex hormones are out of balance.
4203,Men with OHH have too much estradiol (female hormone) and not enough testosterone (male hormone).
4204,"This can lead to medical problems such as diminished sex drive, low sperm count, weak muscles and bones, breast development, and insulin resistance."
4205,"In your clinical trial, researchers were studying a drug called BGS649, which may help increase testosterone levels."
4206,Researchers wanted to find out: Does BGS649 help men with OHH have normal amounts of testosterone?
4207,Does BGS649 cause changes in the amounts of other sex hormones ?
4208,What medical problems did patients in this clinical trial have?
4209,"To answer these questions, researchers asked for the help of men like you."
4210,All of the men in your trial had OHH and were 30 to 65 years old.
4211,3 WHAT KIND OF TRIAL WAS THIS?
4212,This study was planned with two parts.
4213,Part 1 was open-label .
4214,This means that both patients and doctors knew what treatment each patient was receiving.
4215,All patients took BGS649.
4216,"For Part 2, researchers wanted to compare patients who took BGS649 with patients who took a placebo ."
4217,"A placebo looks like the medicine being studied, but has no medicine in it."
4218,"Part 2 of the trial was ended early, because researchers found enough information in Part 1 that showed BGS649 helped men with OHH."
4219,This summary tells you about the results of Part 1.
4220,WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE STUDY?
4221,The first three patients to join the study helped researchers find the best dose of BGS649.
4222,The patients started with a low-dose capsule of BGS649 (0.01 mg).
4223,Then doctors increased the dose until blood samples showed that patients had a normal amount of testosterone.
4224,"When other patients joined the study, they took between 0.03 mg and 5 mg of BGS649 once a week, for 12 weeks."
4225,"Doctors took blood samples four times during the study to test for hormones: before treatment started, after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment stopped."
4226,"Weeks After Treatment Twelve weeks after treatment ends Doctors again took blood samples to test for hormones Weeks During Treatment Weeks 0, 4 and 12 Doctors took blood samples to test for hormones 0 4 12 12 4 Clinical Trial RESULTS WHAT WERE THE STUDY RESULTS?"
4227,Did BGS649 help men with OHH have normal amounts of testosterone?
4229,"Overall, most men had normal amounts of testosterone in their blood while they took BGS649, and for 12 weeks after they stopped."
4230,The table below shows how much testosterone patients had in their blood.
4231,The amount of testosterone in the blood is measured in nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL).
4232,"These are average numbers, which means that some patients had more testosterone and some had less."
4233,One patient left the study after Week 12.
4234,ng/dL means nanograms per deciliter.
4235,It is a unit of measurement.
4236,Amount of Testosterone in Patients Taking BGS649 Before Treatment DURING TREATMENT 12 Weeks After Started Week 4 Week 12 Treatment Ended 0 of 14 14 of 14 13 of 14 13 of 13  (0%) (100%) (93%) (100%) Before Treatment DURING TREATMENT 12 Weeks After Started Week 4 Week 12 Treatment Ended 239 ng/dL  512 ng/dL 514 ng/dL 406 ng/dL How many patients had a normal amount of testosterone for their age?
4237,How much testosterone did patients have in their blood?
4238,"5 Normal amounts of testosterone are from 141 to 827 ng/dL, depending on age."
4239,"Before treatment started, no patients in this study had normal amounts of testosterone based on their age."
4240,"But all patients had normal amounts after 4 weeks of treatment, and most (13 out of 14 patients) had normal amounts after 12 weeks of treatment."
4241,The graph below shows how the amount of testosterone in the blood changed over time.
4242,"When doctors measured testosterone 12 weeks after treatment ended, all of the patients that were still in the trial had normal amounts, but the amounts were dropping."
4243,Change in Amount of Testosterone During the Study Start of Study Week 4 Week 12 / End of Treatment 12 Weeks After Treatment Ends Low Testosterone Normal Testosterone Av er ag e Te sto ste ro ne A m ou nt   One patient left the study after Week 12.

4248,"Blood tests showed that patients taking BGS649 had changes in the amounts of estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)."
4249,LH and FSH are part of the signal from the brain that tells the testes to make more testosterone.
4250,The table below shows how the amounts of these hormones changed over time.
4251,"Changes in Other Hormones in Patients Taking BGS649 During treatment, patients had less estradiol, and more LH and FSH."
4252,Each hormone began returning to pre-treatment amounts after treatment ended.

4257,An adverse event is any sign or symptom occurring during treatment that may or may not be related to the study drug.
4258,Did patients taking BGS649 have adverse events?
4260,"Of the 14 patients who took BGS649 in this study, 11 patients (79%) had adverse events and 3 patients (21%) did not."
4261,What serious adverse events did patients have?
4263,None of the patients in this clinical trial had serious adverse events.
4264,What were the most common adverse events in this study?
4265,The most common adverse events were spontaneous penile erection and headache.
4266,Each of these adverse events happened to 4 patients.
4267,The table to the right shows the 10 most common types of adverse events in this study.
4268,No patients left the study because of an adverse event.
4269,"Here is the full definition of a serious adverse event: An adverse event is considered serious when it is life-threatening, results in death, hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization, causes persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, causes a birth defect, or is an Important Medical Event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed."
4270,"Most Common Number of BGS649 Adverse Events Patients Out of 14 Headache 4 patients (28.6%) Spontaneous penile erection 4 patients (28.6%) Diarrhea 3 patients (21.4%) Nasal congestion 3 patients (21.4%) Mouth and throat pain 3 patients (21.4%) Joint pain 2 patients (14.3%) Cough 2 patients (14.3%) Dizziness 2 patients (14.3%) Frequent bowel movements 2 patients (14.3%) Hair growth abnormal 2 patients (14.3%) The full list of adverse events for your study can be found on the Novartis Clinical Trial Results Database, at www.novctrd.com."
4271,Clinical Trial RESULTS WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS STUDY?
4272,A scientific summary of the results is available online in the Novartis Clinical Trial Results Database (www.novctrd.com).
4273,"After agreeing to enter the website, type CBGS649A2204 into the keyword search box and click Go ."
4274,"If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site."
4285,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for a drug called LIK066.
4286,"You helped researchers learn how LIK066 works in people with high body mass index, or BMI."
4291,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: LIK066 Protocol #: CLIK066X2201 Full Trial Title: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2-part study investigating the effect of LIK066 on body weight in dysglycemic (pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes) and normoglycemic subjects with elevated body mass index Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: June 2015 to April 2016 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
4293,Each participant took part in only 1 part of the trial.
4294,"If you were enrolled in Part 1, you were in this trial for about 18 weeks."
4295,"If you were enrolled in Part 2, you were in this trial for about 8 weeks."
4296,The whole trial took almost 1 year to complete.
4297,The trial included 181 participants from 2 trial sites in the United States.
4298,"When the trial ended in April 2016, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
4301,"Obesity can cause a lot of diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease."
4302,Researchers are looking for a better way to help obese people lose extra weight and also lessen the chances of these diseases from happening.
4303,"The body breaks down food into glucose, also called blood sugar."
4304,"When there is too much blood sugar, the blood sugar can be changed into body fat."
4305,Researchers think that having less sugar in the blood can help obese people lose weight.
4306,"In this trial, researchers wanted to find out if the trial drug LIK066 can help participants lose weight."
4307,LIK066 lessens the body s ability to take up blood sugar from the gut and helps the body remove blood sugar from the kidneys.
4308,Researchers compared LIK066 with a placebo.
4310,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: Did participants who took LIK066 lose more weight than participants who took the placebo?"
4311,Did participants with high blood sugar levels lose more weight than participants with normal blood sugar levels after taking the trial drug 2 or 3 times a day?
4312,How much LIK066 got into the blood?
4315,The participants in this trial were 19 to 65 years old.
4316,"They were all obese and either had normal blood sugar levels or had high blood sugar levels, such as having pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes."
4319,"This means that none of the participants, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if participants were taking LIK066 or the placebo."
4320,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment each participant is taking can affect the results of the trial.
4321,Doing a trial this way helps to make sure that the results are looked at fairly.
4322,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out what all the participants took so they could create a report of the trial results."
4324,"Before the trial started, the trial doctors did tests and determined the BMI of each participant to make sure they could join the trial."
4325,Measuring the BMI of participants helps trial doctors understand how much body fat participants have based on their height and weight.
4326,"During Part 1 of the trial, participants took their trial treatments for up to 12 weeks."
4327,"Participants were randomly assigned to take either: 150 milligrams, or mg, of LIK066 once a day before lunch A placebo once a day before lunch During Part 2 of the trial, participants got their trial treatments for 2 weeks."
4328,"Participants were randomly assigned to get either: 75 mg of LIK066 twice a day before breakfast and dinner and a placebo before lunch 50 mg of LIK066 three times a day before breakfast, lunch, and dinner A placebo three times a day before breakfast, lunch, and dinner The chart below shows how many participants took each treatment: Part 1 Treatment: 88 Participants Part 2 Treatment: 93 Participants 44 participants took 150 mg of LIK066 once a day 44 participants took the placebo once a day 40 participants took 75 mg of LIK066 twice a day 43 participants took 50 mg of LIK066 three times a day 10 participants took the placebo three times a day Each participant was in only 1 part of the trial."
4329,"At each trial site visit, the trial doctors did tests, checked the weight of each participant and measured around their waist to see how well the treatment was working."
4330,"After treatment ended, participants had a final check-up 2 weeks later."
4331,The chart below shows how the trial was done for each part: Part 1 Participants took 1 of the 2 treatments below: 150 mg of LIK066 once a day before lunch Placebo once a day before lunch 12 weeks Part 2 Participants took 1 of the 3 treatments below: 75 mg of LIK066 twice a day before breakfast and dinner 50 mg of LIK066 three times a day before each meal Placebo three times a day before each meal 2 weeks Follow-up Screening visit 4 weeks Participants had a final check-up 2 weeks after treatment ended 2 weeks OR 4 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
4337,Did participants who took LIK066 lose more weight than participants who took the placebo?
4339,Participants who took LIK066 lost more weight compared to participants who took the placebo in both parts of the trial.
4340,After 12 weeks of treatment In Part 1: participants who took LIK066 lost weight.
4341,Participants who took the placebo did not have much of a change in their weight.
4342,Participants who took LIK066 lost an average of 5.51% of their body weight.
4343,Participants who took the placebo gained an average of 0.19% of their body weight.

4353,Participants with high blood sugar levels lost slightly more body weight than participants with normal blood sugar levels.
4354,This happened whether they took the trial drug 2 or 3 times a day.
4355,"But, the differences were too similar for researchers to know if participants with high blood sugar levels lost more weight."
4358,Researchers also wanted to know how much LIK066 got into the blood and if the amount was different between participants with normal blood sugar levels compared with participants with high blood sugar levels.
4359,In Part 1: The highest amount of LIK066 in the blood was similar between participants with normal blood sugar levels and participants with high blood sugar levels.
4360,The amount of time it took LIK066 to reach its highest amount in the blood ranged from 30 minutes to 6 hours.
4361,In Part 2: The highest amount of LIK066 in the blood was similar between participants with normal blood sugar levels and participants with high blood sugar levels.
4362,The amount of time it took LIK066 to reach its highest amount in the blood ranged from 30 minutes to 4.5 hours.
4363,6 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did participants have?
4367,An adverse event is any sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the trial treatment.
4369,Most participants in each treatment group had some adverse events.
4370,"In Part 1, slightly more participants in the LIK066 group had adverse events compared to the placebo group."

4382,There was 1 participant in Part 1 who took 150 mg of LIK066 who had his or her appendix burst or rupture.
4383,This participant stopped participating in the trial.
4384,The trial doctors did not think that this serious adverse event was related to taking the trial treatments.
4385,What were the most non-serious common adverse events?
4386,The most common non-serious adverse event in both parts of the trial was diarrhea.
4387,This adverse event happened in all treatment groups.

4416,Part A lasted about 16 weeks.
4417,Part B lasted about 24 weeks.
4418,The whole trial took about 2 years to complete.
4419,"The trial included 37 patients from 7 trial sites in Denmark, Germany, Italy, and the United States."
4423,Researchers were looking for a better way to help patients with SBMA.
4424,Most patients with SBMA are men.
4425,"Patients with SBMA have muscle cramps and weakness in their arms, legs, face, mouth, or throat."
4426,"Over time, patients with SBMA can lose muscle."
4427,This loss can result in muscle weakness in their legs.
4428,Patients with SBMA have low levels of a protein called IGF-1 in their bodies.
4429,"The trial drug, BVS857, acts like IGF-1."
4430,Researchers compared BVS857 to a placebo in this trial.
4433,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: What medical problems did patients have during the trial?"
4434,Did patients who got BVS857 have more muscle in their thighs than patients who got the placebo?
4435,Did BVS857 help patients more than the placebo in other ways?
4436,How much BVS857 got into the blood?
4438,The patients in this trial were 36 to 80 years old and had SBMA.
4440,The first 2 patients in both Parts A and B got open-label treatment.
4441,"This meant that the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, and sponsor staff knew that the patients were getting BVS857."
4442,The rest of the trial was double-blind .
4443,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were getting BVS857 or the placebo."
4448,"Before the trial started, the trial doctors did tests to check patients overall health."
4449,"Trial doctors also checked patients SBMA symptoms and measured patients thigh muscles using a medical imaging test called magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI."
4450,"3 Clinical Trial Results During Part A of the trial, treatment lasted 9 weeks."
4451,Patients were randomly put into 2 groups.
4452,Patients received trial treatment every other week for 9 weeks.
4453,"The first dose was through a needle put into their vein, called an infusion."
4454,The rest of the doses were given through an injection under the skin.
4455,"In Group 1, patients got different doses of BVS857 every other week."
4456,"In Group 2, patients randomly got either BVS857 or the placebo at different doses every other week."
4457,Patients from Part A could participate in Part B after a washout period that lasted at least 2 months.
4458,"During this time, patients did not take any drugs."
4459,This helped get rid of any effects from previous treatments.
4460,All of the patients had a final check-up 3 weeks after taking their last treatment dose.
4461,"During Part B of the trial, treatment lasted up to 12 weeks."
4463,"All treatments were given through an IV needle: 0.1 mg/kg BVS857 once a week for 3 weeks 0.06 mg/kg BVS857 or the placebo once a week for 12 weeks On Days 36, 85, 106, and 134, the doctors also measured the size of patients thigh muscles using an MRI and checked their SBMA symptoms."
4464,All of the patients had a final check-up 8 weeks after taking their last treatment dose.
4465,"Throughout both parts of the trial, the doctors checked patients overall health and took blood and urine samples."
4466,They also asked patients how they were feeling and if they were taking any new medicines.
4467,The figure below shows how the trial was done: Part A Group 1 patients got different doses of BVS857 once every other week.
4468,Group 2 patients got different doses of either BVS857 or the placebo once every other week.
4469,All patients first got BVS857 through an IV needle and then through an injection under the skin.
4470,Trial doctors checked patients SBMA symptoms every other week.
4471,Part B Patients got either: - 0.1 mg/kg BVS857 once a week for 3 weeks - 0.06 mg/kg BVS857 or the placebo once a week for 12 weeks All patients got BVS857 or the placebo through an IV needle.
4472,Trial doctors checked patients thigh muscles and SBMA symptoms at Week 6 and Week 13.
4473,"Follow-Up For Part A, patients had a final check-up 3 weeks after treatment ended."

4504,The table below shows the most common non-serious adverse events that happened to at least 3 patients out of all patients in Part B.
4505,Most common non-serious adverse events in Part B of this trial Non-serious adverse event BVS857 0.1 mg/kg (Out of 2 patients) BVS857 0.06 mg/kg (Out of 18 patients) Placebo (Out of 9 patients) Total (Out of 29 patients) Common cold symptoms 0 (0.0%) 4 (22.2%) 1 (11.1%) 5 (17.2%) Headache 0 (0.0%) 3 (16.7%) 1 (11.1%) 4 (13.8%) Back pain 0 (0.0%) 1 (5.6%) 2 (22.2%) 3 (10.3%) Did patients who got BVS857 have more muscle in their thighs than patients who got the placebo?
4507,But researchers are not confident that BVS857 caused the difference between the 2 groups.
4508,"After 12 weeks of treatment in Part B, patients who got BVS857 had no change in the amount of muscle in the thigh."
4509,But patients who got the placebo lost more thigh muscle over 12 weeks than what doctors expected for patients with SBMA.
4510,Researchers measured the amount of muscle in patients thighs before and after 12 weeks of treatment: Patients who got BVS857 had no change in the amount of thigh muscle after treatment.
4511,Patients who got the placebo lost 3.4% of their thigh muscle after treatment.
4512,The chart below shows this change in the amount of thigh muscle after 12 weeks of treatment.

4515,"Researchers found that patients who got BVS857 and patients who got the placebo had about the same: Muscle strength and function Lean body mass, or their total body weight without counting their fat The difference between the groups was too small for researchers to know if one treatment was better than the other."
4518,Researchers also wanted to know how much BVS857 got into the blood after treatment.
4519,"Overall, they learned that: When patients got BVS857 through an IV needle put into their vein, patients who got higher doses had higher amounts of BVS857 in their blood."
4520,BVS857 did not stay in the blood for as long as researchers expected.
4521,"When patients got BVS857 through an injection under the skin, the amount of BVS857 in the blood was very different from one patient to another."
4523,"Overall, this trial tested BVS857 in a small group of patients with SBMA."
4524,"These results should be looked at with caution, because the difference in results between treatment with BVS857 and the placebo resulted from the unexpected drop in the amount of thigh muscle in patients who got the placebo and not from a gain in thigh muscle in patients who got BVS857."
4525,No further trials are planned for BVS857.

4540,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug LFG316, also called tesidolumab."
4541,You and all of the patients helped researchers learn more about how LFG316 works in people with kidney failure who are at risk of antibody-mediated rejection after a kidney transplant.
4542,Antibody-mediated rejection is also called ABMR.
4548,You were in the trial for about 3 months.
4549,"But, the entire trial took about 1 year to finish."
4550,This is because the patients started and stopped treatment at different times.
4551,The trial started in August 2016 and ended in July 2017.
4552,The researchers ended the trial earlier than planned because the sponsor decided to stop studying LFG316 in patients with ABMR.
4553,"At first, the researchers planned to include 18 patients in this trial."
4554,"After reviewing results from other LFG316 trials, the sponsor decided to stop studying LFG316 in patients with ABMR."
4555,The sponsor decided to include only 9 patients in this trial.
4556,"But, it was hard to find enough patients to join, so the sponsor ended the trial early."
4557,Only 8 patients in the United States joined and finished the trial.
4562,Researchers are looking for a better way to treat patients with kidney failure who are at risk of developing ABMR after a kidney transplant.
4563,"People who have had blood transfusions, been pregnant, or had a transplant before have a bigger risk of developing ABMR."
4564,There are currently no approved treatments for ABMR.
4565,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: LFG316 Protocol #: CLFG316B2101 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Some patients do not qualify for a transplant because they have donor-specific antibodies .
4566,Antibodies are normally made by the immune system to identify substances like bacteria and viruses that are not made by the body.
4567,"Sometimes, researchers can use antibodies as medicines to treat certain conditions."
4568,"But, donor-specific antibodies often cause the body to reject a kidney transplant because they identify the transplant as something not made by the body."
4569,ABMR develops when the body rejects and attacks the transplanted kidney.
4570,This rejection can cause the transplanted kidney to fail.
4571,"Before the transplant, patients can be treated with medicines like intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, also called IVIG."
4572,IVIG can lower the amount of antibodies in the blood.
4573,This can help make sure the body does not reject the transplanted organ.
4574,"But, it is not always enough to stop ABMR from developing in the patient."
4575,Researchers think a certain type of protein made by the immune system may be involved in ABMR.
4576,The trial drug LFG316 is an antibody that was designed to block this protein.
4577,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out if IVIG changed the amount of LFG316 in the blood in a small number of patients."
4578,"Because LFG316 is an antibody, the researchers wanted to know if IVIG would lower the amount of LFG316."
4579,"To find out, the trial doctors gave some patients both IVIG and LFG316 and gave some patients LFG316 only."
4580,The researchers compared the blood test results from patients who got both IVIG and LFG316 with patients who got LFG316 only.
4581,This information would help doctors decide if LFG316 could be used safely with other drugs like IVIG.
4582,The main questions the researchers wanted to answer in this trial were: Did IVIG change the amount of LFG316 in the patients blood?
4585,"To answer the questions in this trial, the researchers asked for the help of men and women with kidney failure who needed a kidney transplant."
4586,These patients were also at risk of ABMR after receiving a kidney transplant.
4587,The patients in this trial were 39 to 61 years old.
4589,This means each patient knew what treatment they were getting.
4590,The trial staff and sponsor staff also knew what treatment each patient was getting.
4592,A computer program was used to randomly assign the treatment each patient received.
4594,"In some cases, the trial doctor decided which treatment certain patients got."
4595,The trial doctor did this if he or she thought that a patient s overall health would be better in a certain treatment group.
4597,"Before the treatment started, the trial doctors did tests to make sure the patients could take part in the trial."
4598,"The trial doctors: took blood and urine samples from the patients checked the patients blood pressure and heart rate checked the patients heart health using an electrocardiogram, also called an ECG gave patients vaccines and antibiotics, if needed The trial doctors may have given the patients medicine to lower the activity of their immune system."
4599,They did this based on which treatment the patients were assigned.
4600,"During treatment, the patients got their treatment through a needle into a vein."
4601,"The dose of LFG316 was measured in milligrams per kilogram of body weight, also called mg/kg."
4602,All patients got 20 mg/kg of LFG316.
4603,"The dose of IVIG was measured in grams per kilogram of body weight, also called g/kg."
4604,Patients who got IVIG got 2 g/kg of IVIG.
4605,"The patients got 1 of 2 treatments: 6 patients got a single dose of IVIG, then a single dose of LFG316 2 patients got a single dose of LFG316 only The trial doctors may have given the patients medicine to lower the activity of their immune system."
4606,"If a patient got this medicine, the trial doctors waited for the medicine to leave the patient s body before giving the patient LFG316."
4607,This helped the trial doctors make sure that LFG316 did not interact with this medicine.
4608,"After treatment, the patients visited the trial site at least 8 more times."
4609,"At each visit, the trial doctors: checked the patients blood pressure and heart rate asked how the patients were feeling and about any other medicines they were taking took more blood samples Patients waited at least 28 days after getting their last dose of LFG316 before getting their kidney transplant."
4611,"During treatment 6 patients got LFG316 and IVIG 2 patients got LFG316 After treatment The patients visited their trial site at least 8 more times The patients gave more blood samples Up to 31 days Before treatment Trial doctors checked that patients could take part in the trial The patients gave blood and urine samples 1 day 56 days 4 Clinical Trial Results During the trial, the sponsor decided to stop studying LFG316 in patients with ABMR."
4612,"So, the researchers ended the trial early."
4619,Did IVIG change the amount of LFG316 in the patients blood?
4621,IVIG changed the amount of LFG316 in the patients blood.
4622,The researchers wanted to know how the amount of LFG316 in the blood changed when patients got both IVIG and LFG316.
4623,"To answer this question, the researchers compared the amounts of LFG316 in the blood of patients who got IVIG with patients who did not get IVIG."
4624,The researchers measured the amount of LFG316 at different times in the trial.
4625,This helped the researchers find: the total amount of LFG316 in the patients blood during treatment the highest amount of LFG316 in the patients blood after they got LFG316 The graphs below show an example of how the amount of a trial drug in the blood can change over time.
4626,It does not show actual results from this trial.
4627,"Total amount of trial drug in the blood Time of dose Time of last blood sample A m ou nt o f tr ia l d ru g Total amount of trial drug in the blood Time Highest level of trial drug in the blood Time of dose Time of last blood sample A m ou nt o f tr ia l d ru g Highest level of trial drug in the blood Time After 56 days, the researchers found that: The total amount of LFG316 in the blood during the treatment period was higher in patients who got LFG316 only compared with patients who got IVIG and LFG316."
4628,The highest amount of LFG316 in the blood was similar in patients who got either treatment.
4629,The difference between the treatments was too small for researchers to know if IVIG changed the highest amount of LFG316 in the blood.
4630,5 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows the total amount of LFG316 in the blood in patients who got IVIG and in patients who did not get IVIG.

4635,6 Clinical Trial Results What medical problems did the patients have?
4642,"So, when new drugs are being studied, researchers keep track of all medical problems that patients have during each trial."
4645,Both patients who got only LFG316 had adverse events.
4646,Most of the patients who got IVIG and LFG316 had adverse events.
4647,None of the patients in either treatment group had a serious adverse event or left the trial because of an adverse event.
4648,None of the patients died during the trial.

4655,"This happened in 25.0% of patients, which was 2 out of 8 patients."
4656,The table below shows all the adverse events that happened during the trial.
4657,The trial doctors did not think any of the adverse events were related to LFG316.
4658,"Adverse events that happened during this trial Adverse event IVIG and LFG316 (Out of 6 patients) LFG316 (Out of 2 patients) Total (Out of 8 patients) Pain in the arms, legs, hands, or feet 16.7% (1) 50.0% (1) 25.0% (2) Acid reflux 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Back pain 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Cough 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Drowsiness 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Ear pain 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Itching 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Low blood pressure during a medical procedure 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Nausea 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Numbness or tingling in the arms, legs, hands, or feet 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Pain in the bones, muscles, or joints 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Restless legs syndrome 0.0% (0) 50.0% (1) 12.5% (1) Runny nose 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Skin discoloration 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Tiredness 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) Wet cough 16.7% (1) 0.0% (0) 12.5% (1) For more information about the adverse events in this trial, please see the scientific summary that can be found on the website noted at the end of this summary."
4664,The information described above helped the researchers better understand if LFG316 works in people with kidney failure who are at risk of ABMR after a kidney transplant and who are treated with IVIG.
4665,It also helped the researchers learn how other antibodies could be given to people who are getting IVIG.
4666,More trials to study LFG316 in patients with ABMR are currently not planned.
4668,More research is needed to find out which treatments can be used for patients with ABMR.

4697,"This trial was designed to observe each patient for about 1 year, but it took close to 2 years to complete."
4698,The trial included 65 patients from 8 sites.
4699,"Patients were enrolled in sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom."
4700,"Of the 65 patients who entered the trial, 1 patient was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia or having a low number of platelets in the blood."
4701,This patient did not get any treatment.
4702,This trial stopped early in September 2015 because the trial drug did not have the result that was expected.
4703,The last patient completed all of their follow-up appointments for the study in October 2015.
4707,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms or AAAs.
4708,"The abdominal aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the abdomen, pelvis, and legs."
4709,An AAA occurs when the abdominal aorta grows very large and can start to bulge or even burst.
4710,Researchers have found that a protein called IL-1 beta is found in higher amounts in people with an AAA than in other people.
4711,The trial drug ACZ885 is a type of antibody that can block IL-1 beta.
4713,"Researchers are now able to use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of conditions, including an AAA."
4714,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: Did ACZ885 reduce the size and growth of the AAA after 12 months of treatment compared to no trial drug at all?
4718,"This trial was double-blind. This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, or study staff knew what treatment each patient received."
4719,Patients in this trial took either ACZ885 or a placebo.
4720,A placebo looks like the trial drug but contains no medicine at all.
4722,"This way, the results are looked at fairly."
4723,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment patients took, so they could create a report of the trial results."
4726,Double-Blind Treatment: 64 Patients Treated once a month for 12 months 31 patients took 150 mg ACZ885 Months 0 3 6 9 12 Timing of AAA ultrasound 33 patients took a placebo 4 Clinical Trial Results The patients in this trial were men and women between the ages of 53 and 86 years old who had an AAA.
4727,"To participate in the trial, the AAA had to be of a certain size."
4728,Trial doctors checked the size of patients abdominal aorta by taking a picture using a medical test called an ultrasound.
4729,All patients also had full check-ups and a physical examination to make sure they could take part in the trial.
4730,"Trial doctors took blood samples and checked patients height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate and checked participants overall heart health using an electrocardiogram, or ECG."
4731,"Patients with certain conditions, like severe high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, or a history of tuberculosis, were not eligible to join the trial."
4732,The treatment period lasted for 12 months.
4733,"During the treatment period, patients were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to get a monthly injection under the surface of the skin of either a placebo or 150 milligrams (mg) of ACZ885."
4734,"Throughout the trial, trial doctors checked patients weight, temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate and also took blood samples."
4735,Trial doctors also did an ECG at many visits to check the patients heart health.
4736,Patients had ultrasounds of their abdominal aorta done every 3 months.
4737,"About 1 month after the last injection, patients had a final follow-up visit."
4744,5 Clinical Trial Results Did ACZ885 reduce the size and growth of the AAA after 12 months of treatment compared to no trial drug at all?
4746,"Researchers measured the size and growth rate of patients abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA, throughout the trial."
4747,Researchers took a picture of the AAA using an ultrasound.
4748,They used the picture to measure the size and growth rate of the AAA.
4749,"At month 12, patients in the ACZ885 group had a growth of 2.54 millimeters (mm) per year in their AAAs, while patients in the placebo group had a growth of 2.58 mm per year."
4750,"Overall, the results did not show that treatment with ACZ885 was better than the placebo."
4751,The graph below shows the growth in AAA size after 12 months of treatment with ACZ885 or a placebo.

4767,"In this trial, 2 patients in the ACZ885 treatment group experienced a serious adverse event."
4768,The serious adverse events were a broken hip and pain from an aortic aneurysm.
4769,Trial doctors did not think that either of the serious adverse events were related to the trial drug.

4774,Events of Special Interest Researchers also wanted to see if patients in this trial experienced any heart-related adverse events that may happen to people with AAA.
4775,One patient in the ACZ885 group experienced a mini-stroke that may have been caused by a blockage in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain.
4776,Trial doctors did not think that this adverse event was related to the trial drug.
4777,Researchers also wanted to see if patients immune systems made antibodies against ACZ885 in the blood.
4778,"If antibodies against ACZ885 form, the drug may not work as well, or it may cause an allergic reaction to the drug - both may happen, or nothing may happen."
4779,No patients in this trial developed antibodies against ACZ885 in their blood.

4807,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Alcon Research Location of US Headquarters: Fort Worth, TX Drug Studied: Simbrinza (Brinzolamide 1% / Brimonidine 0.2% Ophthalmic Suspension) Protocol #: GLT320a-P001 Short Title: A trial to see if Simbrinza lowers eye pressure for 24 hours in patients with open-angle glaucoma or high eye pressure Trial Date: May 2016 to January 2017 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
4808,"You were in this trial for about 10 weeks, but the trial took about 8 months to complete."
4809,The trial started in May 2016 and ended in January 2017.
4810,The trial included 125 patients from 16 trial sites in the United States.
4814,Researchers were looking for more information about how to treat people with high eye pressure or glaucoma.
4815,"When too much fluid builds up in the front part of the eye, pressure in the eye can increase."
4816,This higher eye pressure can later develop into a disease called glaucoma.
4817,One type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma .
4818,People with this type of glaucoma usually have higher pressure in the eye that can damage the main nerve that controls vision.
4819,This can cause vision loss.
4820,"In this trial, researchers wanted to find out if the trial drug can help lower pressure in the eye over a 24-hour period of time, including both daytime and nighttime."
4821,Researchers compared the trial drug with a placebo.
4823,"In this trial, the placebo was an eye drop like the trial drug, but did not have any real medicine in it."
4824,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: Did eye pressure decrease more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo?"
4825,"During both the daytime and the nighttime, did eye pressure decrease more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo?"
4827,"Out of the 123 patients who completed the trial, 44 were men and 79 were women."
4828,The patients in this trial were 18 to 86 years old and had either high eye pressure or open-angle glaucoma.
4829,Most of the patients in this trial were White (52.8%) or Black/African American (38.2%).
4830,All the patients stopped taking any eye pressure-lowering medicines before joining the trial.
4832,This trial was double-masked .
4833,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were taking the trial drug or the placebo."
4834,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment each patient is taking can affect the results of the trial.
4836,The treatment each patient took was assigned randomly.
4837,The researchers used a computer program to randomly choose if you got the trial drug or the placebo.
4838,"This is done in clinical trials to help make sure the treatments are assigned fairly, and the results are as accurate as possible."
4839,"Of the 125 patients who joined the trial, 124 patients got treatment with the trial drug or the placebo."
4840,3 Clinical Trial Results One patient did not get any treatment because their eye pressure was too high.
4841,"One patient got treatment at first, but then left the trial early due to a medical problem."
4842,"In total, 123 patients completed the trial."
4843,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor collected all the data and created a report of the trial results."
4845,"Before any treatments were given, the doctors did tests to make sure patients could safely participate in the trial."
4846,"Each patient: had a complete eye exam had their eye pressure checked was asked how they were feeling and what medicines they were taking could not take their prescribed eye pressure-lowering medicines for 6 weeks During the trial, each patient: took eye drops containing either the trial drug or the placebo took 1 drop in each eye 3 times a day for 4 weeks had 2 visits to the trial site that lasted 24 hours each At each trial site visit: during daytime hours from 8 AM to 8 PM, doctors measured the eye pressure of patients every 2 hours while they were sitting up during nighttime hours from 10 PM to 6 AM, doctors measured the eye pressure of patients every 2 hours while they were lying down."
4847,The figure below shows how many patients got each treatment and completed this study.
4848,61 patients took a placebo 62 patients took Simbrinza Double-masked treatment: 123 patients 4 weeks of treatment Patients took 1 drop in each eye 3 times a day Trial doctors checked the eye pressure of patients throughout the trial Patients had two 24-hour stays at the trial site 4 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?
4853,Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about the results of a single trial.
4854,Did eye pressure decrease more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo?
4856,Patients who took the trial drug had a larger decrease in their eye pressure after treatment compared with patients who took the placebo.
4857,"Researchers measured eye pressure in millimeters of mercury, also called mmHg."
4858,This is a way to measure the pressure of fluids.
4859,"After 4 weeks of treatment, researcher found that: Patients who took the trial drug had an average decrease in their eye pressure of 3.09 mmHg."
4860,Patients who took the placebo had an average decrease of 0.60 mmHg.
4861,The difference between the two treatment groups was about 2.49 mmHg.
4862,The chart below shows the average change in eye pressure after 4 weeks of treatment.
4863,"Placebo Treatment group Trial drug -0.60 mmHg C h an g e in e ye p re ss u re ( m m H g ) -3.09 mmHg Average change in eye pressure after 4 weeks of treatment -4 -3 -2 -1 0 di erence is 2.49 mmHg 5 Clinical Trial Results During both the daytime and the nighttime, did eye pressure decrease more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo?"
4864,"During the daytime, researchers found that eye pressure decreased more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo."
4865,Trial drug: Eye pressure decreased by 3.93 mmHg.
4866,Placebo: Eye pressure decreased by 0.51 mmHg.
4867,The difference between the two treatment groups was 3.43 mmHg.
4868,"During the nighttime, researchers found that eye pressure decreased more in patients who took the trial drug than in patients who took the placebo."
4869,"But, the difference was too small for researchers to know if one treatment was better than the other at reducing eye pressure during the nighttime."
4870,Trial drug: Eye pressure decreased by 1.88 mmHg.
4871,Placebo: Eye pressure decreased by 0.73 mmHg.
4872,The difference between the 2 treatment groups was 1.15 mmHg.
4879,There were 26 patients out of 124 (21%) who had adverse events.
4880,About the same number of patients in both treatment groups had adverse events.
4881,6 Clinical Trial Results The table below shows how many patients had adverse events during this trial.

4885,0 (0.0%) 1 (1.7%) 1 (0.8%) Did any patients have serious adverse events?
4888,"During the trial, all serious adverse events are reported and written down, whether or not they were caused by the trial drug."
4890,"In this trial, there were 3 serious adverse events that happened in 2 patients who got the placebo: 1 patient had low levels of platelets in the blood, also called thrombocytopenia, and a life-threatening condition from a bacterial infection, also called sepsis."
4891,"1 patient had swollen veins in the lowest part of the large intestine and the anus, also called hemorrhoids."
4892,The trial doctors did not think these serious adverse events were related to the drugs used in this trial.
4893,What were the most common adverse events that were not serious?
4894,Researchers also looked at the most common adverse events that were not serious.
4895,"The most common adverse events that were not serious were inflammation of the white outer layer of the eye, also called conjunctival hyperemia, and redness in the eye overall, also called ocular hyperemia."
4896,7 Clinical Trial Results The table below shows the most common adverse events that were not serious that happened in at least 2 patients in any treatment group.

4913,- National Clinical Trial # NCT02770248
4915,"Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug secukinumab, also called AIN457."
4916,You helped researchers learn about how secukinumab works in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
4917,Novartis sponsored this trial and believes it is important for you to know the results of your trial.
4922,You were in this trial for about 10 months.
4923,The trial started in December 2015 and ended in January 2017.
4924,The trial included 25 patients from 8 trial sites in the United States.
4925,"But, only 24 patients received trial treatment."
4928,Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: Secukinumab Protocol #: CAIN457A2110 Clinical Trial Results 1 2 Clinical Trial Results Why was the research needed?
4929,Secukinumab is an antibody approved to treat patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
4931,"But, researchers can now use antibodies as medications to treat a variety of conditions like plaque psoriasis."
4932,"In this trial, the researchers wanted to find out more about how well the body can break down a second medicine when a patient is already getting secukinumab."
4933,"To test this, the researchers treated patients with secukinumab and gave them another drug called midazolam at the same time."
4934,Midazolam is commonly used to put patients to sleep for certain medical procedures.
4935,One of the ways the body breaks down medicine is through proteins called enzymes.
4936,Midazolam can only be broken down by a specific enzyme called CYP3A4.
4937,The researchers wanted to know if secukinumab changed the ability of CYP3A4 to break down midazolam when both drugs were taken together.
4938,This information would help doctors decide if secukinumab could be used safely with other drugs like midazolam.
4939,"In this trial, the researchers compared the blood test results from when patients took only midazolam with when patients got both secukinumab and midazolam."
4940,The main questions the researchers asked in the trial were: Did secukinumab change the amount of midazolam in the blood?
4942,"To answer these questions, the researchers asked for the help of women and men like you."
4943,The patients in this trial were 18 to 68 years old.
4944,They all had moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis that was not successfully treated in the past.
4947,"That means the sponsor staff, the trial staff, and the patients knew that each patient was taking midazolam and secukinumab."
4949,"Before the trial treatment started, the trial staff did tests to make sure you and the other patients could take part in the trial."
4950,"After joining the trial: You took 5 milligrams, also called mg, of midazolam within a week before getting secukinumab."
4951,The trial staff took blood samples to measure the amount of midazolam in your blood.
4952,During the trial: 24 patients got secukinumab through a needle put under their skin.
4953,They also took midazolam by mouth.
4954,24 patients got 300 mg of secukinumab every week for 5 weeks starting on Day 1 until Day 29.
4955,"Then, they received secukinumab every 4 weeks until Day 169."
4956,Twenty five patients were planned to get secukinumab.
4957,"But, 1 patient did not get secukinumab because he or she left the trial early."
4958,24 patients also took 5 mg of midazolam again on Day 8 and on Day 36.
4959,To check your health and psoriasis symptoms: The trial staff checked your heart health and your psoriasis symptoms before and after getting treatment.
4962,"Treatment with both midazolam and secukinumab lasted up to Day 36, but you continued getting secukinumab up to Day 169."
4963,This was about 24 weeks of treatment.
4964,The follow-up period lasted 12 weeks and included 3 visits.
4965,"During this time, the trial staff checked your psoriasis symptoms."
4966,They also checked how you were feeling and what medications you were taking.
4968,"Treatment (24 patients) Patients got 300 mg of secukinumab once a week for 5 weeks, then once every 4 weeks Patients took 5 mg of midazolam on Day 8 and on Day 36 Follow-up (20 patients) Patients visited the trial site 3 times after their last dose of secukinumab 4 patients stopped the trial before going to a follow-up visit 4 weeks Before treatment (25 patients) Patients took 5 mg of midazolam once before getting secukinumab 1 patient left the trial before receiving secukinumab 24 weeks starting at Day 1 12 weeks 4 Clinical Trial Results What were the results of the trial?"
4970,The results presented here are for this single trial.
4971,Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which doses of the drug work best and are safest for patients.
4975,Did secukinumab change the amount of midazolam in the blood?
4977,The amount of midazolam in the blood was similar when patients took midazolam alone or with secukinumab.
4978,The differences seen when taking midazolam alone or with secukinumab on Day 8 and Day 36 could have been due to chance.
4979,The researchers wanted to know how the body breaks down midazolam when patients took midazolam alone compared to when they took midazolam with secukinumab.
4980,"To answer this question, the researchers compared the amounts of midazolam in the blood before and after treatment with secukinumab."
4981,"Overall, the researchers found the amount of midazolam in the blood was similar with and without secukinumab when they measured: The highest amount of midazolam in the blood How long it took for midazolam to reach its highest amount in the blood The average amount of midazolam in the blood 5 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows the highest amount of midazolam in the blood before and after getting secukinumab."

5044,"The patients were in this trial for about 1 year, but the trial took almost 5 years to complete."
5045,The trial included 27 patients from 1 trial site in the United States.
5049,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat blood cancer.
5052,Sometimes the stem cells come from the bone marrow of a relative.
5053,"In this case, a careful match is needed between the person donating stem cells and the person receiving the stem cells in order for the treatment to work."
5054,Finding this match is often very hard.
5055,Another possible source of stem cells is from umbilical cord blood.
5056,This is the blood left in the placenta after a baby is born.
5057,Using stem cells from umbilical cord blood does not require an exact match.
5058,"Usually, the patient gets a treatment called a single-unit transplant from 1 unit of umbilical cord blood, but the amount of stem cells from a single-unit transplant may not be enough to help treat a patient with blood cancer."
5059,"So, sometimes the patient gets a double-unit transplant from 2 units of umbilical cord blood."
5060,"Even with a double-unit transplant, the patient s body does not recover from the transplant quickly enough."
5062,"Researchers in this trial wanted to learn whether a treatment called HSC835 could increase the number of blood stem cells that came from the umbilical cord unit, to make the transplant process faster and safer."
5063,"In this treatment, the cells in the umbilical cord blood are separated into 2 parts."
5064,One part is grown in the laboratory.
5065,HSC835 increases the number of blood stem cells.
5066,"The rest of the cells are saved for later and are given as part of the treatment, too."
5067,"In this trial, researchers wanted to know: How many patients had medical problems in the first 48 hours after getting HSC835 that were caused by the treatment?"
5069,How many patients stem cells successfully transplanted?
5070,How many patients died during the trial?
5071,How many patients had their blood cancer come back within 1 year of getting HSC835?
5072,How many patients survived their cancer for at least 1 year after getting HSC835?
5074,"To answer these questions, researchers asked for the help of people with blood cancer."
5075,"The patients in this trial were men, women, and children who were 11 to 53 years old and had blood cancer."
5078,"This means that the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, and the sponsor knew what each patient got."
5081,"Before the trial started, trial doctors did a full checkup of all patients to make sure they could join the trial."
5082,"Trial doctors did a physical exam, took blood and urine samples, did other tests, and checked patients lung and heart health."
5083,3 Clinical Trial Results Trial doctors also asked questions about any medical problems and other drugs that the patients were taking.
5085,All patients went through both stages: Pre-transplant treatment and Transplant treatment.
5087,Open-Label Trial Stage 1: Pre-transplant treatment 8 days All patients got: Chemotherapy for 3 days Rest 1 day Radiation therapy twice a day for 4 days Immune system-lowering medicine Stage 2: Transplant treatment About 1 year All patients got HSC835 on Day 1.
5088,HSC835 = cells grown in laboratory plus the cells that were saved for later.
5089,There were 2 groups of patients.
5090,They received one of the following: Group 1: Double-unit transplant: Patients got both HSC835 and 1 unit of umbilical cord stem cells that was not grown in the laboratory Group 2: Single-unit transplant: Patients got HSC835 Stage 1 lasted 8 days.
5091,"During this stage, each patient got high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy."
5092,These treatments helped their bodies get rid of cancer cells.
5093,"In addition, each patient received medicines that would lower their immune system."
5094,These were started 3 days before the transplant and continued after the transplant.
5095,All of the treatments given in this stage were needed to make sure the immune system did not reject the transplanted stem cells.
5096,"Patients got chemotherapy for the first 3 days, then had a day of rest."
5097,"Patients then got radiation therapy twice a day for 4 days, with the last day being the day before getting HSC835."
5098,Patients got 2 immune system lowering medicines 3 days before the transplant and continued taking these after the transplant occurred.
5100,"During this stage of the trial, patients got HSC835 on Day 1 through an infusion."
5101,A total of 27 patients received HSC835.
5102,The patients were split into 2 groups.
5103,Group 1 received HSC835 as part of a double-unit transplant and Group 2 received HSC835 as part of a single-unit transplant.
5104,Group 1: A total of 18 patients got the double-unit transplant: Patients who got the double-unit transplant received the following infusions: - 1 unit of umbilical cord stem cells that was not grown in the laboratory - HSC835 (cells grown in the laboratory and the cells that were saved) A total of 15 adults and 3 children got the double-unit transplant.
5105,"Group 2: Next, researchers in the trial tried a single-unit transplant after they successfully tried the double- unit transplant."
5106,A total of 9 patients received a single-unit transplant: Patients who got the single-unit transplant received the following infusion: - HSC835 (cells grown in the laboratory and the cells that were saved) A total of 8 adults and 1 child got the single-unit transplant.
5107,"4 Clinical Trial Results After the transplant, patients were checked on for 1 year to see how well they were handling the transplant and how they were feeling."
5109,"This is a summary of the overall results of this trial, not the patients individual results."
5114,How many patients had medical problems in the first 48 hours after getting HSC835 that were caused by the treatment?
5115,One of the main questions researchers asked in this trial was how well the patients handled the blood stem cell infusion.
5116,"To answer this question, they looked at the number of patients who had medical problems or adverse events in the first 48 hours after getting HSC835."
5118,"Out of the 27 patients in the trial, 1 patient (3.7%) in the double-unit transplant group had 2 adverse events in the first 48 hours after getting HSC835 that trial doctors thought were caused by the treatment: Fever and a low number of white blood cells Low blood pressure How many patients had successful transplants?"
5119,Researchers wanted to know how many patients had successful transplants.
5120,"In this trial, a transplant was successful if blood cells called neutrophils grew back in the patients bodies after treatment."
5121,All patients in the trial had successful transplants of HSC835.
5122,Both the single-unit and double-unit transplants with HSC835 were successful.
5124,Researchers were also interested in how many patients had successful transplants in a 42-day period of time.
5125,"In this trial, a transplant was successful if neutrophils grew in patients blood after treatment."
5126,"Researchers found that: All patients, whether they got the single-unit transplant or the double-unit transplant, had neutrophils grow from the transplanted blood stem cells and appear in their blood within 42 days of the transplant."
5127,Researchers also looked at whether platelets grew in patients blood after treatment.
5128,Platelets are tiny cells in the blood that help your blood clot.
5129,"If you get a cut, some of your platelets stick together to plug the hole in the blood vessel wall caused by the cut."
5130,Researchers found that 74.1% of patients had platelets grow from the transplanted blood stem cells and appear in their blood within 6 months of getting HSC835.
5131,That was 20 out of 27 patients.
5132,How many patients died during the trial because of the transplant?
5133,Out of the 27 patients in the trial: 5 patients (18.5%) died within 100 days of getting the transplant.
5134,8 patients (29.6%) died within 1 year of getting the transplant.
5135,5 Clinical Trial Results How many patients had their blood cancer come back within 1 year of getting HSC835?
5136,"Out of the 27 patients in the trial, 3 (11.1%) had their cancer come back within 1 year of getting HSC835: 2 of the 8 adults (25%) who got the single-unit transplant had their cancer come back within 1 year."

5187,National Clinical Trial # NCT01474681
5191,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug secukinumab.
5192,You helped researchers learn more about how secukinumab works in people with chronic plaque psoriasis that affects their scalp.
5193,"Novartis, the sponsor of this trial, thanks you for your help and wants you to know the results of your trial."
5197,Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Drug Studied: Secukinumab National Clinical Trial #: NCT02267135 Protocol #: CAIN457AUS01 Trial Date: September 2014 to December 2015 Short Trial Title: A trial to test if secukinumab helps improve scalp psoriasis and is safe to use 2 Clinical Trial Results What s happened since the trial ended?
5198,This trial started in September 2014 and ended in December 2015.
5199,You were in this trial for about 6 months.
5200,"However, the entire trial took a little over 1 year to complete."
5201,The trial included 102 participants from 17 sites in the United States.
5202,When the trial ended the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results.
5205,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat plaque psoriasis on the scalp.
5206,Researchers wanted to see if a drug called secukinumab was safe to use and if it helped minimize psoriasis on your scalp.
5207,Researchers compared secukinumab with a placebo.
5209,The main questions researchers asked were: Did secukinumab help treat psoriasis on the scalp better than a placebo?
5210,Did secukinumab help in other ways?
5211,Did participants have medical problems during the trial?
5213,All participants in this trial were between 18 and 69 years old.
5214,All had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis on their scalps for at least 6 months before entering this trial.
5217,"That means none of the participants, doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant received."
5218,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants had got so they could report the trial s results."
5220,Trial doctors did a full checkup of all participants.
5221,"Some participants were already taking medications to treat their psoriasis, and those individuals were asked to slowly stop taking any medicine that would make it more difficult to test secukinumab."
5223,Part 1 lasted 12 weeks.
5224,"Participants were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to take either 300 milligrams (mg) of secukinumab or a placebo."
5225,Participants went to a doctor s office and were injected with the medicine or the placebo into their skin.
5226,"At Week 12, participants returned to the doctor s office to record if their scalp psoriasis had improved or not improved."
5227,Part 2 also lasted 12 weeks.
5228,"In Part 2, all participants from Week 12 received the same number of shots (5 weekly injections and then once every 4 weeks)."
5229,"Participants who received placebo in Part 1, and whose scalp psoriasis did not improve enough after Part 1, were injected with secukinumab until the end of the trial."
5230,"Participants who received placebo in Part 1, and whose scalp psoriasis did improve enough after Part 1, were injected with placebo until the end of the trial."
5231,Participants who received secukinumab in Part 1 received secukinumab every 4 weeks until the end of the trial.
5232,"In addition, from Week 13 to Week 15, those participants also received weekly placebo shots."
5233,This was done so that both participants and study doctors did not know which treatment they were receiving (because everyone got the same number of shots).
5234,This did not impact the way secukinumab worked.
5235,4 Clinical Trial Results The chart below shows how long the trial lasted and what treatments participants got.
5236,What Happened During the Trial?
5237,"0 4 16 28 In Part 1, participants were randomly assigned to recieve either secukinumab or placebo."
5238,"In Part 2, participants from the Part 1 placebo group could be switched to secukinumab or could continue to stay on the placebo depending on whether their psoriasis improved or not during Part 1."
5239,"Screening Period Part 1 Part 2 4 weeks 12 weeks 12 weeks Secukinumab 300 mg = 5 weekly shots, then every 4 weeks Secukinumab 300 mg = Monthly except 3 placebo shots Placebo = 5 weekly shots, then every 4 weeks Placebo = 5 weekly shots, then every 4 weeks Secukinumab 300 mg = 5 weekly shots, then every 4 weeks Part 1 of the trial enrolled 102 participants."
5240,97 participants completed treatment.
5241,97 participants continued into Part 2 of the trial.
5242,92 participants completed treatment.
5244,This is a summary of the overall results and may not be the same for all participants.
5245,Researchers look at results of many studies to decide which drugs work best and are safer for participants.
5248,You should not change your treatment based on the results of a single trial without first talking to your doctor.
5249,5 Clinical Trial Results Did secukinumab help treat psoriasis on the scalp better than a placebo?
5252,One test was called the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI).
5253,"The PSSI measures the severity of your psoriasis, and your score was compared before you started the trial and again after 12 weeks of treatment."
5254,Researchers wanted to learn how many participants had at least 90% improvement of their scalp psoriasis after 12 weeks of treatment.
5255,"Another test was called the Investigator s Global Assessment, or IGA."
5256,"It measured the severity of your scalp s psoriasis on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 meant no sign of psoriasis, 1 meant almost no psoriasis, and 4 meant the psoriasis was severe."
5257,Researchers wanted to learn how many participants had no sign or almost no sign of psoriasis after 12 weeks of treatment.
5258,The table below shows the PSSI and IGA results for participants in each group.
5259,Relief of Psoriasis Symptoms after 12 Weeks of Treatment in Part 1 Treatment Groups Secukinumab 300 mg (out of 51 participants) Placebo (out of 51 participants) Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) Test Participants with 90% improvement in scalp psoriasis 27 (53%) 1 (2%) Investigator s Global Assessment (IGA) Test Participants with no or almost no signs of psoriasis 29 (57%) 3 (6%) Did secukinumab help in other ways?
5261,Participants answered questions about their quality of life and psoriasis symptoms during the trial.
5262,"Researchers found that participants who got secukinumab reported less itching, pain, and scaling at the end of Part 1 than participants receiving the placebo."
5263,6 Clinical Trial Results Did participants have medical problems during the trial?
5264,Some participants did.
5265,"A lot of research is needed to know whether a drug causes a medical problem, or adverse event. An adverse event is any sign or symptom that may or may not have been caused by the trial drug."
5268,"52 participants (51%) had adverse events in Part 1 39 participants (40%) had adverse events in Part 2 2 participants (2%) left the trial because of adverse events during Part 2 The table below shows how many participants had adverse events, how many had serious adverse events, and how many left the trial early due to an adverse event."

5273,"An adverse event is called serious when it is life threatening, causes lasting problems, or needs hospital care."
5274,No participants died during this trial.
5275,1 participant (1%) from Part 1 of the trial experienced a serious adverse event.
5276,"That participant was in the placebo group and developed cellulitis, an infection in the skin."
5277,Trial doctors did not think that the serious adverse event was related to the placebo.
5278,No participants had serious adverse events during Part 2 of the trial.
5280,Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which drugs work best and are safer for patients.
5284,"Then, click I accept. After agreeing to enter the Novartis website, type CAIN457AUS01 into the keyword search box and click Search. If you have questions about the results, please speak with the doctor or staff at your trial site."
5285,"Official trial title: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to demonstrate the efficacy of subcutaneous secukinumab (300 mg) as assessed by the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) at 12 weeks of treatment, compared to placebo, and to assess safety and tolerability up to 24 weeks in adult subjects with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis Thank you It is said that the greatest gift is one which is given anonymously, giving when you do not know whether you will get direct personal benefit."
5297,You helped researchers learn more about how QBW251 works in both healthy people and people with cystic fibrosis.
5298,This trial started in July 2012 and ended in November 2015.
5303,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Drug Studied: QBW251 Protocol #: CQBW251X2101 Full Trial Title: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Pharmacodynamics of Single and Multiple Ascending Doses of QBW251 in Healthy Subjects, and Multiple Doses in Cystic Fibrosis Patients Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: July 2012 to November 2015 2 Clinical Trial Results What s happened since the trial ended?"
5304,"You were in this trial for up to 6 weeks, but the trial took close to 3.5 years to complete."
5305,The trial included 153 participants from 28 sites in Europe and the United States.
5306,"When the trial ended in November 2015, the sponsor reviewed the data and created a report of the results."
5309,"Researchers were looking for a better way to treat cystic fibrosis, or CF."
5310,"This is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body."
5311,This can result in life-threatening lung infections and other serious problems.
5312,"People with CF have a protein in the body called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, that does not work well."
5313,"When CFTR does not work well, the amount of salt and water in the lungs and other parts of the body are not balanced, which can lead to serious health problems."
5314,"In this trial, researchers wanted to study a drug called QBW251, which is thought to help CFTR work better."
5315,Researchers compared QBW251 with a placebo.
5317,"In your trial, researchers wanted to know: What medical problems did participants have during the trial?"
5318,Did QBW251 increase participants lung function more than the placebo?
5319,"How much QBW251 got into the blood, and did food affect this amount?"
5320,Did QBW251 help in any other ways?
5322,The participants in this trial were 18 to 56 years old.
5323,"This trial included both healthy volunteers as well as volunteers with CF, also known as patients, who had tested positive for a CFTR mutation."
5324,Many trials include both healthy volunteers and patients so that researchers can compare the results between the 2 groups.
5326,"In this trial, participants took either QBW251 or a placebo."
5328,"This means that none of the participants, trial doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant received."
5329,Some trials are done this way because knowing what treatment each participant is getting can affect the results of the trial.
5331,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants received so they could create a report of the trial results."
5333,Trial doctors first did a full checkup of all participants to make sure they could join the trial.
5334,"Participants were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to take either QBW251 or the placebo."
5335,This trial took place in 3 parts.
5336,Each trial participant was enrolled in only 1 part of the trial.
5337,The figure below shows the 3 parts of the trial.
5338,"Double-Blind Trial Part 1: 64 Healthy Volunteers Single Dose About 2 weeks Healthy volunteers took a single dose of either 10 milligrams (mg), 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg or 1000 mg of QBW251 or the placebo without food."
5339,"Some healthy volunteers also took either 500 mg of QBW251 or the placebo with food, so researchers could learn if eating food affected how much of QBW251 got into the blood."
5340,"Healthy volunteers stayed at the trial site until Day 3, and returned there for follow-up visits on Days 4, 5, 8, and 15."
5341,"Part 2: 40 Healthy Volunteers Multiple Doses About 5 weeks Healthy volunteers took a single dose of either 150 mg, 450 mg, or 750 mg of QBW251 or the placebo without food once a day for 14 days."
5342,Some healthy volunteers also took either 450 mg or 750 mg of QBW251 or the placebo with food 2 times a day for 14 days.
5343,"Healthy volunteers stayed at the trial site until Day 16, and returned there for follow up visits on Days 18, 22, 29, and 36."
5344,Part 3: 49 Patients Multiple Doses About 6 weeks Patients with CF were divided into 3 groups.
5345,Patients in Groups 1 and 2 had a different kind of CFTR mutation than the patients in Group 3.
5346,Patients took either 150 mg or 450 mg of QBW251 or the placebo 2 times a day for 14 days just after eating food.
5347,Patients went to the trial site on Day 1 and stayed there for at least 8 hours after receiving the first dose in the morning.
5348,"Patients returned to the trial site on Days 4, 7, and 14 and for follow-up visits on Days 15, 28, and 42."
5349,"Throughout the trial, the doctors checked the blood pressure, pulse rate, and breathing rate of each participant."
5350,They also collected blood and urine samples from each participant.
5351,"During Part 3, trial doctors also collected mucus and sweat samples from each patient."
5352,"They also checked each patient s lung function, and asked about their CF symptoms."
5353,Part 3 patients were divided into 3 groups.
5354,All Part 3 patients had CF-causing mutations.
5355,Group 1 and 2 patients had 2 different CF-causing mutations.
5356,Group 3 patients had 2 specific CF-causing mutations that were the same.

5379,"5 Clinical Trial Results Three patients in Part 3 experienced a serious adverse event - 1 patient each in Groups 1, 2, and 3."
5380,The serious adverse events were sinus infection in 1 patient and increased difficulty in breathing in 2 patients.
5381,But the trial doctors did not think that any of the serious adverse events were related to the trial drug.
5383,"In Part 1, headache and dizziness were the only non-serious adverse events that happened in at least 7% of all healthy volunteers in the trial."
5384,"This happened in: In the QBW251 1000 mg group, 2 out of 6 (33.3%) healthy volunteers each had headache and dizziness."
5385,"In the QBW251 300 mg group, 1 out of 6 (16.7%) healthy volunteers had headache."

5390,"During Part 3, researchers learned if QBW251 increased lung function more than the placebo in patients with CF."
5391,They measured 2 things to learn this: How evenly air got in and out of the lungs How much air patients exhaled in 1 second How evenly air got in and out of the lungs Researchers used a test called the lung clearance index that measured how well the lungs could clear air.
5392,"Each patient was given a score based on this test, which was done both before treatment started, and again on Day 15 after treatment started."

5397,How much air patients exhaled in 1 second Researchers also tested how much air patients could breathe out in 1 second.
5398,"They tested this both before treatment started, and again on Day 15 after treatment started."
5399,"If the average change in this amount had increased by Day 15, this meant that patients could breathe out more air in 1 second."

5404,Researchers wanted to know if patients who took higher doses of QBW251 had more QBW251 stay in the blood.
5405,The amount of QBW251 in the blood was higher for patients who took more QBW251.
5406,This was true for all parts of the trial.
5407,"When healthy volunteers in Part 1 took QBW251 with a high-fat meal, the total amount of QBW251 in the blood was reduced by about 20%."
5408,Did QBW251 help in other ways?
5409,"Quality of Life Scores In Part 3 of the trial, researchers also used a survey to ask patients how they were feeling and how the trial drugs affected their CF symptoms."
5410,An increase in the survey score after taking treatment meant that a patient had a better quality of life than he or she had before treatment started.
5411,"After 2 weeks of treatment, researchers found that: Patients in Groups 1 and 2 had bigger increases in their survey scores than patients in the placebo group."
5412,Patients in Group 3 had similar decreases in their survey scores as patients in the placebo group.

5430,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the treatment LFX453.
5431,You helped researchers learn how LFX453 works in people with external genital warts.
5436,"Clinical Trial Results Research Sponsor: Novartis Location of Headquarters: Basel, Switzerland Treatment Studied: LFX453 Protocol #: CLFX453X2202 Full Trial Title: A randomized, vehicle-controlled, active comparator, parallel group study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical LFX453 formulations in patients with external genital warts (EGWs) Full Scientific Summary: www.novctrd.com Trial Date: May 2015 to May 2016 2 Clinical Trial Results What has happened since the trial ended?"
5437,The whole trial took 1 year to complete.
5438,The trial included 88 patients from 12 trial sites in the United States.
5442,"Researchers were looking for a better way to treat external genital warts, also called EGWs."
5443,Most cases of EGWs are caused by a virus that is spread through sexual contact.
5444,One common way to treat EGWs is to remove the wart.
5445,But removing the wart does not stop the spread of the virus for some people and the EGWs can also come back.
5446,"In this trial, researchers wanted to learn if the trial treatment LFX453 can work with the body s immune system to help clear EGWs from the skin."
5448,"Imiquimod, also known as Aldara , is a treatment that is currently available to treat EGWs."
5452,Did LFX453 completely clear EGWs in more patients than imiquimod or the placebo?
5453,Did LFX453 clear 75% of EGWs in more patients than imiquimod or the placebo?
5455,The patients in this trial were 19 to 58 years old and had EGWs.
5457,Researchers tested about LFX453 in a double-blind manner.
5458,"This means that none of the patients, trial doctors, trial staff, or sponsor staff knew if patients were taking LFX453 or the placebo."
5461,There was also an open-label part of the trial.
5462,The patients in this part of the trial got imiquimod.
5463,"Open-label means that the patients, some trial doctors, and sponsor staff knew which patients were getting imiquimod."
5464,But the trial staff that looked at the skin of each patient did not know which treatment the patient got.
5465,This helped make sure the results were looked at fairly.
5467,"Before the trial started, the trial doctors did tests to check the overall health of the patients, including their heart health using an electrocardiogram or ECG."
5468,"Trial doctors took blood and urine samples and checked the height, weight, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate of each patient."
5469,Trial doctors also counted the EGWs of each patient and examined the area of the skin affected by EGWs.
5470,"During the trial, treatment lasted up to 12 or 16 weeks."
5471,Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatments by a computer: LFX453 Cream 1 LFX453 Cream 2 A placebo that looked like LFX453 Cream 1 A placebo that looked like LFX453 Cream 2 Imiquimod Patients who got LFX453 or the placebo used the cream twice a day for up to 12 weeks.
5472,Patients who got imiquimod used the cream 3 times a week for up to 16 weeks.
5473,The trial doctors continued to check the skin condition of the patients.
5474,"This included touching the skin, taking pictures of the EGWs, and potentially taking skin samples."
5475,Trial doctors also took blood and urine samples and checked the heart health of the patients.
5476,The figure below shows how many patients got each treatment during the trial.
5477,Treatment: 88 patients 24 patients got LFX453 Cream 1 - twice a day 22 patients got LFX453 Cream 2 - twice a day 10 patients got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 1 - twice a day 10 patients got the placebo for LFX453 Cream 2 - twice a day 22 patients got imiquimod - 3 times a week Not all of the patients finished their assigned treatment.
5478,Some patients left the trial early.
5479,"After treatment ended, all patients had a follow-up visit 2 weeks later."
5480,"At this visit, the trial doctors asked patients how they were feeling and if they had any reactions to the skin creams."
5481,"If patients did not have their EGWs completely cleared, this was their final trial visit."
5482,"If patients had complete clearance of EGWs in the 2-week follow-up period, they entered another follow-up period of 12 weeks."
5483,Complete clearance meant that patients had zero EGWs in the area of their skin where they applied trial treatment.
5485,Treatment 12 weeks Follow-up LFX453 or placebo 16 weeks Imiquimod All patients had a nal check-up 2 weeks after the trial treatment ended.
5486,Trial doctors checked patients symptoms.
5487,This was the patient s nal visit if they had incomplete clearance.
5488,Patients were followed for 12 more weeks if they had complete clearance.
5489,C re am 2 weeks 12 weeks Trial doctors checked patients EGWs every 2 weeks Tr ea tm en t s to pp ed What were the results of the trial?
5500,"A total of 26.1% of patients, or 23 of the 88 patients, had adverse events during the trial."
5501,More patients in the imiquimod group had adverse events compared to the other treatment groups.
5502,None of the patients stopped taking treatment because of adverse events in the trial.
5504,Adverse events in this trial LFX453 Cream 1 (Out of 24 patients) LFX453 Cream 2 (Out of 22 patients) Placebo for LFX453 Cream 1 (Out of 10 patients) Placebo for LFX453 Cream 2 (Out of 10 patients) Imiquimod (Out of 22 patients) How many patients had adverse events?

5508,None of the patients in this trial had serious adverse events.
5511,"The most common adverse event that was not serious was infection of the nose, throat, or airways."
5512,The table below shows the most common non-serious adverse events that happened to at least 2% of all patients in the trial.
5513,"Most common non-serious adverse events in this trial Most common adverse event LFX453 Cream 1 (Out of 24 patients) LFX453 Cream 2 (Out of 22 patients) Placebo for LFX453 Cream 1 (Out of 10 patients) Placebo for LFX453 Cream 2 (Out of 10 patients) Imiquimod (Out of 22 patients) Total (Out of 88 patients) Infection of the nose, throat, or airways 8.3% (2) 4.5% (1) 10.0% (1) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 4.5% (4) Common cold 0.0% (0) 4.5% (1) 10.0% (1) 0.0% (0) 4.5% (1) 3.4% (3) Redness at the site of applying cream 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 9.1% (2) 2.3% (2) Genital rash 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 9.1% (2) 2.3% (2) Redness of the scrotum 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 9.1% (2) 2.3% (2) The adverse events that trial doctors thought could be related to trial treatment were experienced by patients in the imiquimod group."
5514,Six of these adverse events were related to having reactions where the cream was applied.
5515,"The other adverse events included sleep disorder, night sweats, low white blood cell count, and high white blood cell count."
5516,6 Clinical Trial Results Did LFX453 completely clear EGWs in more patients than imiquimod or the placebo?
5517,Only 1 patient had their EGWs completely clear during the trial.
5519,"So, there were not enough patients taking LFX453 who had their EGWs completely clear for the researchers to know if LFX453 completely cleared EGWs more than imiquimod or a placebo."
5520,"Researchers found that within 14 weeks of the first treatment: None of the patients had their EGWs completely clear during the treatment period, no matter what treatment they got."
5521,1 patient out of 15 taking LFX453 Cream 1 had their EGWs completely clear during the 2-week follow-up period.
5522,No other patients had their EGWs completely clear during the 2-week follow-up period.
5523,The difference between the groups was too small for researchers to know if 1 treatment was able to clear EGWs more than the other.
5524,Any differences seen between the treatment groups could have been due to chance.
5525,The chart below shows the number of patients who had complete clearance of EGWs from their skin within 14 weeks of the first treatment.
5526,Percentage of patients who had complete EGW clearance within 14 weeks of the first treatment Pe rc en ta ge (% ) o f p at ie nt s LFX453 Cream 1 LFX453 Cream 2 All Placebo Treatment group 0 25 50 75 100 6.7% 0.0% 0.0% Imiquimod 0.0% Did LFX453 clear 75% of EGWS in more patients than imiquimod or the placebo?
5528,"So, there were not enough patients taking LFX453 who had 75% of their EGWs clear."
5529,This means the researchers could not know if LFX453 cleared 75% of EGWs more than imiquimod or a placebo.
5530,The patient taking LFX453 who had his EGWs completely clear could have had this result by chance.
5531,7 Clinical Trial Results Researchers were interested in how many patients had at least 75% of their EGWs clear from their skin.
5532,Researchers found that at the end of the treatment period: 12.5% of patients in the LFX453 Cream 1 group had at least 75% of their EGWs clear from their skin after 12 weeks of treatment.
5533,This was 2 out of 16 patients.
5534,10.0% of patients in the LFX Cream 2 group had at least 75% of their EGWs clear from their skin after 12 weeks of treatment.
5535,This was 1 out of 10 patients.
5536,No patients in the placebo groups had at least 75% of their EGWs clear from their skin after 12 weeks of treatment.
5537,21.4% of patients in the imiquimod group had 75% of their EGWs clear from their skin after 14 weeks of treatment.
5538,This was 3 out of 14 patients.
5539,Researchers had also planned to look at the time it took for the LFX453 treatment to get rid of EGWs and how quickly EGWs came back in patients who had complete clearance.
5540,But researchers could not answer these questions because only 1 patient had complete clearance of EGWs.
5542,The results presented here are for a single trial in men with EGWs.
5543,Researchers look at the results of many trials to decide which treatments work best and are safest for participants.

5560,Thank you for taking part in the clinical trial for the drug LCZ696.
5561,"You helped researchers learn more about how LCZ696 works in people with high blood pressure and stiffness in the aorta, the largest artery in the body."
5562,This trial started in October 2013 and ended in June 2015.
5564,An independent non-profit organization called CISCRP prepared this summary of the trial results for you with the help of a medical writing organization.

5568,"You were in this trial for about 1 year, but the trial took a little over 1 years to complete."
5569,"The trial included 115 participants from 4 sites: Germany (2), Switzerland (1), and the United Kingdom (1)."
5573,Researchers were looking for a better way to treat people with high blood pressure.
5574,Some people with high blood pressure experience stiffness in the walls of the main artery of the body called the aorta.
5576,Researchers in this trial wanted to see if a drug called LCZ696 could help lower blood pressure and reduce stiffening in the aorta.
5577,Researchers compared LCZ696 with a drug called olmesartan.
5578,Olmesartan is approved to treat high blood pressure.
5579,The main questions researchers asked in the trial were: Did LCZ696 reduce stiffening of blood vessels more than olmesartan after 52 weeks of treatment?
5580,Did LCZ696 help in other ways?
5581,How safe was LCZ696 and what were the medical problems?
5583,The participants in this trial were 23 to 80 years old and had high blood pressure.
5584,Their blood pressure results also indicated stiffness in the walls of their aorta.
5587,"This means none of the participants, trial doctors, or staff knew what treatment each participant received."
5589,"That way, no one was biased when trying to understand the results."
5590,"When the trial ended, the research sponsor found out which treatment participants took so they could create a report of the trial results."
5591,3 Clinical Trial Results The figure below shows how the trial was done.
5592,"Double-Blind Treatment: 114 Participants Before Treatment Week 12 Week 52 44.1% Part A: Single-Drug Period Part B: Add-On Period Lower Dose: 2 weeks Higher Dose: 10 weeks 40 weeks 57 participants took 200 mg LCZ696, then 400 mg LCZ696 Participants continued taking either 400 mg LCZ696 or 40 mg olmesartan If they needed further help in controlling their blood pressure, they could also take 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg amlodipine 57 participants took 20 mg olmesartan, then 40 mg olmesartan Pictures of the heart taken using MRI What happened during the trial?"
5593,Trial doctors did a full check-up of all participants to make sure they were good candidates for the trial.
5594,They also took blood samples and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to take detailed pictures of the heart and aorta.
5595,"Because some participants were already taking medications to treat high blood pressure, everyone initially took a placebo for 4 weeks during a washout period ."
5596,A placebo looks like the study drug but has no medicine in it.
5597,Washout periods help get rid of the effect that previous medications may have had.
5598,Part A lasted 12 weeks.
5599,"For the first 2 weeks, participants were randomly assigned, like flipping a coin, to take either 200 milligrams (mg) LCZ696 or 20 mg olmesartan."
5600,Researchers were interested in seeing if participants could handle these doses without having medical problems.
5601,"Then, for the next 10 weeks, participants took higher doses of the study drugs, either 400 mg LCZ696 or 40 mg olmesartan."
5602,4 Clinical Trial Results Part B lasted 40 weeks.
5603,"During this longer part of the trial, participants continued taking either 400 mg LCZ696 or 40 mg olmesartan."
5604,"However, if these drugs were not controlling their blood pressure well enough, participants could also begin taking 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of amlodipine."
5605,This is a drug also approved to lower high blood pressure.
5606,"Throughout the trial, trial doctors took blood samples and checked participants weight, temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate."
5607,Trial doctors also checked participants arteries using MRI scans.
5609,This is a summary of the overall findings and may not be the same for all participants.
5610,Researchers look at results of many studies to decide which drugs work best and are safer for patients.
5614,Did LCZ696 reduce stiffening of blood vessels more than olmesartan after 52 weeks of treatment?
5616,"LCZ696 did reduce stiffening, but the difference between LCZ696 and olmesartan was too small for researchers to know if LCZ696 reduced stiffening of blood vessels more than olmesartan after 52 weeks of treatment."
5617,"Using MRI scans, trial doctors looked at the stiffness of different parts of the aorta with each heartbeat."
5618,"Trial doctors examined the ascending aorta, or the part of the aorta that receives blood from the heart."
5619,"They also examined two parts of the descending aorta, or the part of the aorta that sends blood downward towards the lower part of the body."
5620,Researchers measured the change in the average stiffness in the aorta.
5621,They found that all 3 areas of the aorta showed less stiffness after 52 weeks of treatment with either LCZ696 or olmesartan.
5622,5 Clinical Trial Results The graph below shows the change in average stiffness of the aorta after 52 weeks of treatment with LCZ696 or olmesartan.
5623,Researchers measured the change in the average stiffness in mmHg.
5624,"The higher the number is, the less stiff the arteries are, which makes it easier for the heart to pump blood to the body."

5626,Researchers found that LCZ696 did not help more than olmesartan after 52 weeks of treatment in the following ways: Aortic strain (stretching/straining of the aortic wall).
5627,Aortic pulse wave velocity (speed of the pressure as it moves down the aorta).
5628,Central blood pressure (overall pressure in the aorta).
5629,"However, the gap between the high and low blood pressure in the central aorta (beside the heart) was lower with olmesartan than with LCZ696."
5630,Augmentation pressure and index (how a pulse flowing through the aorta affects its pressure).
5635,An adverse event is any sign or symptom that may or may not be caused by the study drug.
5637,A total of 89 participants (78.1%) had adverse events in the trial.
5638,Two participants (1.8%) left the study because of adverse events.
