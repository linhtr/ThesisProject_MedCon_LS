       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nAutism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child\\'s life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. \\n\\nAutism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), combines autism and less severe forms of the condition, including Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). \\n\\nEarly behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been cases of children who recovered. Not many autistic adults are able to live independently, though some are successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured. \\n\\nGlobally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide. In the developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD . from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It occurs four-to-five times more often in males than females. The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice. The question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved. \\n\\nAutism is a highly variable, neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits. \\n\\nSocial deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling \" like an anthropologist on Mars \" . \\n\\nUnusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person\\'s own emotions. \\n\\nChildren with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply. \\n\\nThere are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns. \\n\\nAbout a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others\\' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD. For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language. \\n\\nIn a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends. \\n\\nAutistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows. \\n\\nStereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking. \\n\\nCompulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing. \\n\\nSameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. \\n\\nRitualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors. \\n\\nRestricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game. \\n\\nSelf-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging. \\n\\nNo single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors. \\n\\nAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family. This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US. \\n\\nAn estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur. \\n\\nThere is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria. \\n\\nGastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism. These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes. \\n\\nParents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults. \\n\\nIt has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism\\'s characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur. \\n\\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory. \\n\\nMaternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system. \\n\\nExposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. \\n\\nParents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \" overload \", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been \" an elaborate fraud \" . Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. Vaccines and autism: \\n\\nAutism\\'s symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies. \\n\\nThere is evidence that gut–brain axis abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain. \\n\\nSeveral lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development. \\n\\nDiagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the DSM-5, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay. ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition. \\n\\nSeveral diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used. \\n\\nA pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression. \\n\\nClinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing. A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome\\'s copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism\\'s genetics. Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine. \\n\\nASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys. \\n\\nUnderdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms. \\n\\nAutism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance. \\n\\nOf the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or sometimes the autistic disorders, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or infantile autism. In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact. \\n\\nAutism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear. Validity of ASD subtypes: \\n\\nSome studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression. \\n\\nResearch into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics. Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. \\n\\nAutism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds. Some people have called for an end to the terms \" high-functioning \" and \" low-functioning \" due to lack of nuance and the potential for a person\\'s needs or abilities to be overlooked. \\n\\nAbout half of parents of children with ASD notice their child\\'s unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \" is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome \" . \\n\\nNo response to name (or eye-to-eye gaze) by 6 months. \\n\\nNo babbling by 12 months. \\n\\nNo gesturing (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months. \\n\\nNo single words by 16 months. \\n\\nNo two-word (spontaneous, not just echolalic) phrases by 24 months. \\n\\nLoss of any language or social skills, at any age. \\n\\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor, the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good specificity (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture\\'s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features. \\n\\nWhile infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases. \\n\\nThe main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child\\'s needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by behavior analysts, special education teachers, speech pathologists, and licensed psychologists. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns. \\n\\nEducational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of ABA that is carried out with very young children—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment. \\n\\nEarly, intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children; it is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers. \\n\\nMedications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD or anxiety. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Lack of research on drug treatments: \\n\\nNo known medication relieves autism\\'s core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism. \\n\\nAlthough many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Lack of support for interventions: \\n\\nTreatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. The preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders. In 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism. Chelation is not recommended for people with ASD since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is CEASE therapy, a mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and \\'vaccine detoxing\\'. \\n\\nAlthough popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten- and casein-free diet as a standard treatment. A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double blind crossover trial, 1 single blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect. \\n\\nIn the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten-free diet may improve some autistic behaviors. \\n\\nThere is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects. \\n\\nThere is no known cure. The degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Many children with autism lack social support, future employment opportunities or self-determination. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age. \\n\\nFew high-quality studies address long-term prognosis. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism. \\n\\nMany individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. Compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. About half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed. \\n\\nMost recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD as of 2007. A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of PDD-NOS\\'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010. \\n\\nThe number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism\\'s true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. \\n\\nBoys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed. \\n\\nAlthough the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism. \\n\\nSeveral other conditions are common in children with autism. They include: \\n\\nGenetic disorders. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders. \\n\\nIntellectual disability. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum. In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker, and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger\\'s excludes intellectual disability. \\n\\nAnxiety disorders are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD\\'s symptoms. \\n\\nEpilepsy, with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of language disorder. \\n\\nSeveral metabolic defects, such as phenylketonuria, are associated with autistic symptoms. \\n\\nMinor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population. \\n\\nPreempted diagnoses. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted. \\n\\nSleep problems affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis. \\n\\nA few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The Table Talk of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair\\'s marriage to gain Blair\\'s inheritance. The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation. \\n\\nThe New Latin word autismus (English translation autism) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word autós (αὐτός, meaning \" self \" ), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to \" autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance \" . A Soviet child psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926. \\n\\nThe word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler\\'s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Reprinted in Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner\\'s first paper on the subject, notably \" autistic aloneness \" and \" insistence on sameness \" , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger. \\n\\nDonald Triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as \" case 1 \" . Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords. \\n\\nKanner\\'s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia, and child psychiatry\\'s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant\\'s response to \" refrigerator mothers \" . Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome. \\n\\nAs late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child\\'s autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research. \\n\\nIt took until 1980 for the DSM-III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the DSM-III-R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors. \\n\\nThe Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being. \\n\\nAn autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements. Events include World Autism Awareness Day, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others. Organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include Autism Speaks, Autism National Committee, and Autism Society of America. Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \" autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements. \" While most autistic individuals do not have savant skills, many have been successful in their fields. \\n\\nThe autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism; and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \" high-functioning \" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \" low-functioning \" autistic people. \\n\\nAbout half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market. Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children. \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body. \\n\\nAccording to ICD-11, the following disorders are counted among motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), pseudobulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA), as well as some rarer variants resembling ALS. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases affect both children and adults. While each motor neuron disease affects patients differently, they all cause movement-related symptoms, mainly muscle weakness. Most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes, but some forms are inherited. Studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes (e.g. SOD1) that are thought be important in understanding how the disease occurs. \\n\\nSymptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life. Most of these diseases worsen over time; while some of them shorten one\\'s life expectancy (e.g. ALS), others do not. \\n\\nCurrently, there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders, and care is mostly symptomatic. \\n\\nSigns and symptoms depend on the specific disease, but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement-related symptoms. They come on slowly, and worsen over the course of more than three months. Various patterns of muscle weakness are seen, and muscle cramps and spasms may occur. One can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs (exertion), difficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea), or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved. Bulbar symptoms, including difficulty speaking (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and excessive saliva production (sialorrhea), can also occur. Sensation, or the ability to feel, is typically not affected. Emotional disturbance (e.g. pseudobulbar affect) and cognitive and behavioral changes (e.g. problems in word fluency, decision-making, and memory) are also seen. There can be lower motor neuron findings (e.g. muscle wasting, muscle twitching), upper motor neuron findings (e.g. brisk reflexes, Babinski reflex, Hoffman\\'s reflex, increased muscle tone), or both. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases are seen both in children and in adults. Those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial, and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk. Those that affect adults tend to appear after age 40. The clinical course depends on the specific disease, but most progress or worsen over the course of months. Some are fatal (e.g. ALS), while others are not (e.g. PLS). \\n\\nVarious patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases. Weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric, and it can occur in body parts that are distal, proximal, or both... According to Statland et al., there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases, which are: \\n\\n, Asymmetric distal weakness without sensory loss (e.g. ALS, PLS, PMA, MMA) \\n\\n, Symmetric weakness without sensory loss (e.g. PMA, PLS) \\n\\n, Symmetric focal midline proximal weakness (neck, trunk, bulbar involvement; e.g. ALS, PBP, PLS) \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases are on a spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings, while others have a mix of both. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, spasticity, muscle spasm, and abnormal reflexes. \\n\\nPure upper motor neuron diseases, or those with just UMN findings, include PLS. \\n\\nPure lower motor neuron diseases, or those with just LMN findings, include PMA. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases with both UMN and LMN findings include both familial and sporadic ALS. \\n\\nMost cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known. It is thought that environmental, toxic, viral, or genetic factors may be involved. \\n\\nTARDBP (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), also referred to as TDP-43, is a critical component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enzymatic pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons. Mitra J, Guerrero EN, Hegde PM, Liachko NF, Wang H, Vasquez V, Gao J, Pandey A, Taylor JP, Kraemer BC, Wu P, Boldogh I, Garruto RM, Mitra S, Rao KS, Hegde ML. Motor neuron disease-associated loss of nuclear TDP-43 is linked to DNA double-strand break repair defects. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Feb 15. pii: 201818415. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1818415116. PMID:30770445 TDP-43 is rapidly recruited to double-strand breaks where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the XRCC4-DNA ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double-strand breaks. About 95% of ALS patients have abnormalities in the nucleus-cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of TDP43. In TDP-43 depleted human neural stem cell-derived motor neurons, as well as in sporadic ALS patients’ spinal cord specimens there is significant double-strand break accumulation and reduced levels of NHEJ. \\n\\nIn adults, men are more commonly affected than women. \\n\\nDifferential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms, shared between several motor neuron diseases. Frequently, the diagnosis is based on clinical findings (i.e. LMN vs. UMN signs and symptoms, patterns of weakness), family history of MND, and a variation of tests, many of which are used to rule out disease mimics, which can manifest with identical symptoms. \\n\\nPlease refer to individual articles for the diagnostic methods used in each individual motor neuron disease. \\n\\nMotor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on electrophysiological testing. As discussed above, the term \" motor neuron disease \" has varying meanings in different countries. Similarly, the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term \" motor neuron disease \" . The four main types of MND are marked () in the table below. \\n\\nAll types of MND can be differentiated by two defining characteristics: \\n\\n, Is the disease sporadic or inherited? \\n\\n, Is there involvement of the upper motor neurons (UMN), the lower motor neurons (LMN), or both? \\n\\nSporadic or acquired MNDs occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease. Inherited or genetic MNDs adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Some disorders, like ALS, can occur sporadically (85%) or can have a genetic cause (15%) with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease. \\n\\nUMNs are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord. LMNs originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles. Both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle, but damage to an UMN can be distinguished from damage to a LMN by physical exam. \\n\\nType UMN degeneration LMN degeneration \\n\\nSporadic MNDs \\n\\nSporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Yes Yes \\n\\nPrimary lateral sclerosis (PLS) Yes No \\n\\nProgressive muscular atrophy (PMA) No Yes \\n\\nProgressive bulbar palsy (PBP) Yes Yes, bulbar region \\n\\nPseudobulbar palsy Yes, bulbar region No \\n\\nMonomelic amyotrophy (MMA) \\n\\nNo \\n\\nYes \\n\\nInherited MNDs \\n\\nFamilial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\\n\\nYes \\n\\nYes \\n\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests: Analysis of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord could reveal signs of an infection or inflammation. \\n\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI of the brain and spinal cord is recommended in patients with UMN signs and symptoms to explore other causes, such as a tumor, inflammation, or lack of blood supply (stroke). \\n\\nElectromyogram (EMG) & nerve conduction study (NCS): The EMG, which evaluates muscle function, and NCS, which evaluates nerve function, are performed together in patients with LMN signs. \\n\\nFor patients with MND affecting the LMNs, the EMG will show evidence of: (1) acute denervation, which is ongoing as motor neurons degenerate, and (2) chronic denervation and reinnervation of the muscle, as the remaining motor neurons attempt to fill in for lost motor neurons. \\n\\nBy contrast, the NCS in these patients is usually normal. It can show a low compound muscle action potential (CMAP), which results from the loss of motor neurons, but the sensory neurons should remain unaffected. \\n\\nTissue biopsy: Taking a small sample of a muscle or nerve may be necessary if the EMG/NCS is not specific enough to rule out other causes of progressive muscle weakness, but it is rarely used. \\n\\nThere are no known curative treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders. Please refer to the articles on individual disorders for more details. \\n\\nThe table below lists life expectancy for patients who are diagnosed with MND. Please refer to individual articles for more detail. \\n\\nType \\n\\nMedian survival time from start of symptoms \\n\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) \\n\\n2–5 years \\n\\nPrimary lateral sclerosis (PLS) \\n\\n8–10 years \\n\\nProgressive muscular atrophy (PMA) \\n\\n2–4 years \\n\\nProgressive bulbar palsy (PBP) \\n\\n6 months – 3 years \\n\\nPseudobulbar palsy \\n\\nNo change in survival \\n\\nIn the United States, the term motor neuron disease is often used to denote amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig\\'s disease), the most common disorder in the group. In the United Kingdom, the term is spelled motor neurone disease and is frequently used for the entire group, but can also refer specifically to ALS. \\n\\nWhile MND refers to a specific subset of similar diseases, there are numerous other diseases of motor neurons that are referred to collectively as \" motor neuron disorders \" , for instance the diseases belonging to the spinal muscular atrophies group. However, they are not classified as \" motor neuron diseases \" by the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), which is the definition followed in this article. \\n\\nSpinal muscular atrophies \\n\\nHereditary motor and sensory neuropathies \\n\\n',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. It is often triggered by a viral infection or, perhaps exceedingly rarely specific non-routine vaccinations. \\n\\nADEM\\'s symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS. Unlike MS, ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever, although adolescents and adults can get the disease too. ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), over a long period of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these \\'multiphasic\\' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases. \\n\\nIt affects about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and adolescents, with the average age around 5 to 8 years old. The disease affects males and females almost equally. ADEM shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5%; however, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases with increase in survival rates up to 70 to 90% with figures including minor residual disability as well. The average time to recover from ADEM flare-ups is one to six months. \\n\\nADEM produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord, but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex, thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved. \\n\\nWhen a person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM). Also, a fulminant course in adults has been described. \\n\\nADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies. \\n\\nSince the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical courses of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis Martin S. Weber, Tobias Derfuss, Wolfgang Brück, Anti–Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody–Associated Central Nervous System Demyelination—A Novel Disease Entity?, August 2018, JAMA Neurol. 2018;75(8):909-910. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1055 \\n\\nAbout how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patients serum there are several theories: \\n\\nA preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two-thirds of people. Some viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, dengue, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. \\n\\nExposure to vaccines: The only vaccine proven related to ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. \\n\\nIn rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600. \\n\\nADEM term has been inconsistently used at different times Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the International Pediatric MS Study Group, revision 2007. \\n\\nGiven that the definition is clinical, it is currently unknown if all the cases with ADEM are positive for anti-MOG autoantibody, but in any case it seems strongly related to ADEM diagnosis. \\n\\nWhile ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects. Some authors consider MS and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course, while others consider them discretely different diseases. \\n\\nTypically, ADEM appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, and can also be clinically multiphasic. \\n\\nProblems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis. If MS were defined just by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as McDonald did, it would not be enough to make a difference, as some cases of ADEM satisfy these conditions. Therefore, some authors propose to establish the separation line in the shape of the lesions around the veins, being therefore \" perivenous vs. confluent demyelination \" . \\n\\nThe pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenular inflammation with limited \" sleeves of demyelination \" . Nevertheless, MS-like plaques (confluent demyelination) can appear \\n\\nPlaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the glial scar in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply. \\n\\nNevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy or even postmortem ADEM in adults can progress to MS \\n\\nWhen the person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM). \\n\\nIt has been found that anti-MOG auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM \\n\\nAnother variant of ADEM in adults has been described, also related to anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis, and it has been reported to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy. It has been classified inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases. \\n\\nAcute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst\\'s disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature ), it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases, and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema. Death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about 70%, but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits, but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the magnitude of the white matter affected. \\n\\nThis disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\\'s disease, malaria, sepsis associated with immune complex deposition, methanol poisoning, and other underlying conditions. Also anecdotal association with MS has been reported \\n\\nLaboratory studies that support diagnosis of AHL are: peripheral leukocytosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lesions of AHL typically show extensive T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages, significant edema, and mass effect. \\n\\nNo controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect. \\n\\nThere is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately \\n\\nIn a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered. A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset. \\n\\nFull recovery is seen in 50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as mRS or EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5%-10%. Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes. The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present. \\n\\nADEM can progress to MS. It will be considered MS if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas \\n\\nResidual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis. \\n\\nPatients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability. Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery. All six children performed in the normal range on most tests, including verbal IQ and performance IQ, but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain, such as complex attention (one child), short-term memory (one child) and internalizing behaviour/affect (two children). Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS. \\n\\nAnother study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age. \\n\\nThe relationship between ADEM and anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research. A new entity called MOGDEM has been proposed. \\n\\nAbout animal models, the main animal model for MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is also an animal model for ADEM. Being an acute monophasic illness, EAE is far more similar to ADEM than MS. \\n\\nOptic neuritis \\n\\nTransverse myelitis \\n\\nVictoria Arlen \\n\\nInformation for parents about Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality, speech changes, and abnormalities in eye movements. Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. Friedreich\\'s ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. The word is from Greek α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = \" lack of order \" . \\n\\nThe term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia that is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions, many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia. People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions. This results in a characteristic type of irregular, uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways, such as asthenia, asynergy, delayed reaction time, and dyschronometria. Individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait, difficulty with eye movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypotonia, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. These deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged, and whether the lesion is bilateral or unilateral. \\n\\nPeople with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side. Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk. Dysarthria, an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by \" scanning \" speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm and variable volume. There may also be slurring of speech, tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. There is overshooting (or hypermetria) with finger to nose testing, and heel to shin testing; thus, dysmetria is evident. Impairments with alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), as well as dysrhythmia, may also be displayed. There may also be tremor of the head and trunk (titubation) in individuals with cerebellar ataxia. \\n\\nIt is thought that dysmetria is caused by a deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion. Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, flexion at the shoulder would create a torque at the elbow, while extension of the elbow would create a torque at the wrist. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations. \\n\\nDysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum (flocculonodular lobe) impairs the balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with postural instability, in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid titubation (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative Romberg\\'s test, or more accurately, it denotes the individual\\'s inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. \\n\\nDysfunction of the spinocerebellum (vermis and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based \" drunken sailor \" gait (called truncal ataxia), characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, falling is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74–93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling. \\n\\nDysfunction of the cerebrocerebellum (lateral hemispheres) presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia). These include: \\n\\nintention tremor (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso); \\n\\npeculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining); \\n\\na peculiar pattern of dysarthria (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm). \\n\\ninability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as dysdiadochokinesia. This could involve rapidly switching from pronation to supination of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed. \\n\\ninability to judge distances or ranges of movement. This is known as dysmetria and is often seen as undershooting, hypometria, or overshooting, hypermetria, the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone\\'s finger or touch his or her own nose. \\n\\nthe rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia. For example, when a patient is flexing his or her elbow isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patient\\'s arm may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patient will check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement. \\n\\npatients may exhibit a constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are gathered under the terminology of Schmahmann\\'s syndrome. \\n\\nThe term sensory ataxia is employed to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception, the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain which receive positional information, including the cerebellum, thalamus, and parietal lobes. \\n\\nSensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady \" stomping \" gait with heavy heel strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input, such as in poorly lit environments. \\n\\nPhysicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during physical examination by having the patient stand with his/her feet together and eyes shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall. This is called a positive Romberg\\'s test. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when the patient is standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patient\\'s finger will tend to \" fall down \" and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the \" ataxic hand \" ). \\n\\nThe term vestibular ataxia is employed to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the vestibular system, which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent vertigo, nausea and vomiting. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and dysequilibrium may be the sole presentation. \\n\\nThe three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, and therefore can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging. \\n\\nAny type of focal lesion of the central nervous system (such as stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory [such as sarcoidosis], and “chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome” [CLIPPERS ]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the thalamus or parietal lobe); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the cerebral cortex). \\n\\nExogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is ethanol (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most antiepileptic drugs have cerebellar ataxia as a possible adverse effect), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 ingestion and various other recreational drugs (e.g. ketamine, PCP or dextromethorphan, all of which are NMDA receptor antagonists that produce a dissociative state at high doses). A further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia, especially in high doses, are benzodiazepines. Exposure to high levels of methylmercury, through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations, is also a known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders. \\n\\nAtaxia can be induced as a result of severe acute radiation poisoning with an absorbed dose of more than 30 grays. \\n\\nVitamin B 12 deficiency may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia. \\n\\nSymptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with hypothyroidism. These include reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis and coma. Most of the neurological complications improve completely after thyroid hormone replacement therapy. \\n\\nPeripheral neuropathies may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia (e.g. a limb only) depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement. Spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below, when they involve the dorsal columns. \\n\\nNon-hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic ethanol abuse, head injury, paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia, high altitude cerebral oedema, coeliac disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus and infectious or post-infectious cerebellitis. \\n\\nAtaxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia, episodic ataxia, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as Friedreich\\'s ataxia (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and Niemann Pick disease, ataxia-telangiectasia (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and abetalipoproteinaemia. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome or FXTAS. \\n\\nArnold–Chiari malformation is a malformation of the brain. It consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla through the foramen magnum, sometimes causing hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow. \\n\\nSuccinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal-recessive gene disorder where mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene results in the accumulation of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in the body. GHB accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological dysfunction. \\n\\nWilson\\'s disease is an autosomal-recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the ATP7B gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body. Copper accumulates in the nervous system and liver and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments. \\n\\nGluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible. It accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias. Less than 10% of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom, yet about 40% have intestinal damage. \\n\\nMalfunction of the sodium-potassium pump may be a factor in some ataxias. The - pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, \" housekeeping \" molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, an ouabain block of - pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations. \\n\\nAntibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD: enzyme changing glutamate into GABA) cause cerebellar deficits. The antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits. \\n\\nThe treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as stroke or a benign tumour), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition. A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009. A small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical. Diseases include vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann–Pick type C disease, Refsum\\'s disease, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, episodic ataxia type 2, gluten ataxia, glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia. \\n\\nThe movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability. Some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), idebenone, amantadine, physostigmine, L-carnitine or derivatives, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vigabatrin, phosphatidylcholine, acetazolamide, 4-aminopyridine, buspirone, and a combination of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E. \\n\\nPhysical therapy requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating motor learning for retraining specific functional motor patterns. A recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective, but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion. The most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation, Frenkel exercises, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), and balance training; however, therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy. \\n\\nCurrent research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a mobility aid, physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and contracture prevention. Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes. These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living. While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip and/or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain. \\n\\nDecomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia. Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining. Their therapy consisted of constraint-induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function. Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination. Severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a wheelchair. To obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns. \\n\\nThere are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia. The International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity. Other tools that assess motor function, balance and coordination are also highly valuable to help the therapist track the progress of their patient, as well as to quantify the patient\\'s functionality. These tests include, but are not limited to: \\n\\nThe Berg Balance Scale \\n\\nTandem Walking (to test for Tandem gaitability) \\n\\nScale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) \\n\\ntapping tests – The person must quickly and repeatedly tap their arm or leg while the therapist monitors the amount of dysdiadochokinesia. \\n\\nfinger-nose testing – This test has several variations including finger-to-therapist\\'s finger, finger-to-finger, and alternate nose-to-finger. \\n\\nThe term \" ataxia \" is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include optic ataxia (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and ataxic respiration (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata). Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of Balint\\'s syndrome, but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex. \\n\\nAtaxic cerebral palsy \\n\\nSpinocerebellar ataxia \\n\\nBruns apraxia \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nAn abscess is a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body. Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling. The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed. The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling. Carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles, with carbuncles being larger. \\n\\nThey are usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection. \\n\\nStandard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage. There appears to be some benefit from also using antibiotics. A small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage. Closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning. Sucking out the pus with a needle is often not sufficient. \\n\\nSkin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use, with rates reported as high as 65% among users. In 2005 in the United States, 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia, around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 with the condition. \\n\\nAbscesses may occur in any kind of tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules (boils) or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys, and tonsils. Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues, and extensive regional tissue death (gangrene). \\n\\nThe main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills. If superficial, abscesses may be fluctuant when palpated; this wave-like motion is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess. \\n\\nAn internal abscess is more difficult to identify, but signs include pain in the affected area, a high temperature, and generally feeling unwell. \\n\\nInternal abscesses rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected. An abscess can potentially be fatal depending on where it is located. \\n\\nRisk factors for abscess formation include intravenous drug use. Another possible risk factor is a prior history of disc herniation or other spinal abnormality, though this has not been proven. \\n\\nAbscesses are caused by bacterial infection, parasites, or foreign substances. \\n\\nBacterial infection is the most common cause. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism involved. \\n\\nRarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Specific parasites known to do this include dracunculiasis and myiasis. \\n\\nSurgery of the anal fistula to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery. There is no evidence that fecal incontinence is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage. \\n\\nPerianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn\\'s disease) or diabetes. Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication. This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess. This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the anus which grows larger and more painful with time. Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and debridement or lancing. \\n\\nAn incisional abscess is one that develops as a complication secondary to a surgical incision. It presents as redness and warmth at the margins of the incision with purulent drainage from it. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for Gram stain and bacterial culture. \\n\\nAn abscess is a defensive reaction of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. \\n\\nThe organisms or foreign materials kill the local cells, resulting in the release of cytokines. The cytokines trigger an inflammatory response, which draws large numbers of white blood cells to the area and increases the regional blood flow. \\n\\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object. \\n\\nFile:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess \\n\\nfile:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|Pyemic abscesses of kidney \\n\\nAn abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by pyogenic membrane. Ultrasound imaging in the emergency department can help in diagnosis. \\n\\nAbscesses may be classified as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses. Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose, and more serious. United Kingdom National Health Service \\'Abscess\\' Skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses. Medline Plus \\'Abscess\\' \\n\\nFor those with a history of intravenous drug use, an X-ray is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present. In this population if there is also a fever present infectious endocarditis should be considered. \\n\\nAbscesses should be differentiated from empyemas, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity. \\n\\nOther conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: cellulitis, a sebaceous cyst and necrotising fasciitis. Cellulitis typically also has an erythematous reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage. \\n\\nThe standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining. There does not appear to be any benefit from also using antibiotics in most cases. A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze. \\n\\nThe abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment. \\n\\nIn critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort. The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the respiratory tract. Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess. \\n\\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated. \\n\\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin is used. The Infectious Diseases Society of America advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The American College of Emergency Physicians advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. If the condition is thought to be cellulitis rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. Antibiotic therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low pH levels. \\n\\nCulturing the wound is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage. Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment. \\n\\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits. \\n\\nMore recently, several North American hospitals have opted for less-invasive loop drainage over standard drainage and wound packing. In one study of 143 pediatric outcomes, a failure rate of 1.4% was reported in the loop group versus 10.5% in the packing group (P <.030), while a separate study reported a 5.5% failure rate among loop patients. \\n\\nClosing an abscess immediately after draining it appears to speed healing without increasing the risk of recurrence. This may not apply to anorectal abscesses. While they heal faster, there may be a higher rate of recurrence than those left open. \\n\\nEven without treatment, skin abscesses rarely result in death, as they will naturally break through the skin. Other types of abscess are more dangerous. Brain abscesses are fatal if untreated. When treated, the mortality rate reduces to 5-10%, but is higher when the abscess ruptures. \\n\\nSkin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. Risk factors include intravenous drug use, with rates reported as high as 65% among users. In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 for the disease. \\n\\nThe Latin medical aphorism \" ubi pus, ibi evacua \" expresses \" where there is pus, there evacuate it \" and is classical advice in the culture of Western medicine. \\n\\nNeedle exchange programmes often administer or provide referrals for abscess treatment to injection drug users as part of a harm reduction public health strategy. \\n\\nAn abscess is so called because there is an abscessus (a going away or departure) of portions of the animal tissue from each other to make room for the suppurated matter lodged between them. \\n\\nThe word carbuncle is believed to have originated from the Latin: carbunculus, originally a small coal; diminutive of carbon-, carbo: charcoal or ember, but also a carbuncle stone, \" precious stones of a red or fiery colour \" , usually garnets. \\n\\nThe following types of abscess are listed in the medical dictionary: \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Arachnophobia is the unreasonable fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions. \\n\\nTreatment is typically by exposure therapy, where the person is presented with pictures of spiders or the spiders themselves. \\n\\nPeople with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as webs. If arachnophobes see a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia. Some people run away, scream, cry, have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, sweat, have increased heart rates, or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme cases, even a picture or a realistic drawing of a spider can trigger intense fear. \\n\\nArachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies. \\n\\nAn evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved. One view, especially held in evolutionary psychology, is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders, or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Being relatively small, spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a factor, but they can have medically significant venom. However, a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear. \\n\\nBy ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders, arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments, giving them a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However, having a disproportionate fear of spiders in comparison to other, potentially dangerous creatures present during Homo sapiens environment of evolutionary adaptiveness may have had drawbacks. \\n\\nA 2001 study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders. The researchers suggested that this was because fast response to spiders was more relevant to human evolution. \\n\\nThe alternative view is that the dangers, such as from spiders, are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution. Instead, inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival, rather than being an aid. For some communities such as in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia spiders are included in traditional foods. This suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural, rather than genetic trait. \\n\\nThe fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias. The first line of treatment is systematic desensitization – also known as exposure therapy. Before engaging in systematic desensitization, it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques, which will help keep the patient calm. Systematic desensitization can be done in vivo (with live spiders) or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders, then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders. This technique can be effective in just one session, although it generally takes more time. \\n\\nRecent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy. These techniques have proven to be effective. It has been suggested that exposure to short clips from the Spider-Man movies may help to reduce an individual\\'s arachnophobia. \\n\\nArachnophobia affects 3.5 to 6.1 percent of the global population. \\n\\nArachnophobia\\'\\' (film) \\n\\nApiphobia (fear of bees) \\n\\nEntomophobia (fear of insects) \\n\\nMyrmecophobia (fear of ants) \\n\\nZoophobia (fear of animals) \\n\\nNational Geographic: \" Fear of Snakes, Spiders Rooted in Evolution, Study Finds \"',\n",

Some research has found that the condition is more common among women. \\n\\nWhen this occurs there is a characteristic pattern of symptoms: \\n\\nFlashes of light (photopsia) \\n\\nA sudden dramatic increase in the number of floaters \\n\\nA ring of floaters or hairs just to the temporal side of the central vision \\n\\nAs a posterior vitreous detachment proceeds, adherent vitreous membrane may pull on the retina. While there are no pain fibers in the retina, vitreous traction may stimulate the retina, with resultant flashes that can look like a perfect circle. \\n\\nIf a retinal vessel is torn, the leakage of blood into the vitreous cavity is often perceived as a \" shower \" of floaters. Retinal vessels may tear in association with a retinal tear, or occasionally without the retina being torn. \\n\\nA Weiss ring can sometimes be seen with ophthalmoscopy as very strong indicator that vitreous detachment has occurred. This ring can remain free-floating for years after detachment. \\n\\nThe risk of retinal detachment is greatest in the first 6 weeks following a vitreous detachment, but can occur over 3 months after the event. \\n\\nThe risk of retinal tears and detachment associated with vitreous detachment is higher in patients with myopic retinal degeneration, lattice degeneration, and a familial or personal history of previous retinal tears/detachment. \\n\\nThe vitreous (Latin for \" glassy \" ) humor is a gel which fills the eye behind the lens. Between it and the retina is the vitreous membrane. With age the vitreous humor changes, shrinking and developing pockets of liquefaction, similar to the way a gelatin dessert shrinks and detaches from the edge of a pan. At some stage the vitreous membrane may peel away from the retina. This is usually a sudden event, but it may also occur slowly over months. \\n\\nAge and refractive error play a role in determining the onset of PVD in a healthy person. PVD is rare in emmetropic people under the age of 40 years, and increases with age to 86% in the 90s. Several studies have found a broad range of incidence of PVD, from 20% of autopsy cases to 57% in a more elderly population of patients (average age was 83.4 years). \\n\\nPeople with myopia (nearsightedness) greater than 6 diopters are at higher risk of PVD at all ages. \\n\\nPosterior vitreous detachment does not directly threaten vision. Even so, it is of increasing interest because the interaction between the vitreous body and the retina might play a decisive role in the development of major pathologic vitreoretinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane. \\n\\nPVD may also occur in cases of cataract surgery, within weeks or months of the surgery. \\n\\nThe vitreous membrane is more firmly attached to the retina anteriorly, at a structure called the vitreous base. The membrane does not normally detach from the vitreous base, although it can be detached with extreme trauma. However, the vitreous base may have an irregular posterior edge. When the edge is irregular, the forces of the vitreous membrane peeling off the retina can become concentrated at small posterior extensions of the vitreous base. Similarly, in some people with retinal lesions such as lattice retinal degeneration or chorio-retinal scars, the vitreous membrane may be abnormally adherent to the retina. If enough traction occurs the retina may tear at these points. If there are only small point tears, these can allow glial cells to enter the vitreous humor and proliferate to create a thin epiretinal membrane that distorts vision. In more severe cases, vitreous fluid may seep under the tear, separating the retina from the back of the eye, creating a retinal detachment. Trauma can be any form from a blunt force trauma to the face such as a boxer\\'s punch or even in some cases has been known to be from extremely vigorous coughing or blowing of the nose. \\n\\nPosterior Vitreous Detachment is diagnosed via dilated eye examination. For some patients the vitreous gel is extremely clear and so it can be hard to see the PVD. In these cases, additional imaging such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or ocular ultrasound are used. \\n\\nTherapy is not required or indicated in posterior vitreous detachment, unless there are associated retinal tears, which need to be repaired. In absence of retinal tears, the usual progress is that the vitreous humor will continue to age and liquefy and floaters will usually become less and less noticeable, and eventually most symptoms will completely disappear. Prompt examination of patients experiencing vitreous humor floaters combined with expeditious treatment of any retinal tears has been suggested as the most effective means of preventing certain types of retinal detachments. \\n\\nVitreous membrane \\n\\nCentral serous retinopathy \\n\\nList of eye diseases and disorders \\n\\nEpiretinal membrane \\n\\nVitrectomy \\n\\nFloater \\n\\n',\n",

It may be congenital, surgically created for hemodialysis treatments, or acquired due to pathologic process, such as trauma or erosion of an arterial aneurysm. \\n\\nHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia \\n\\nJust like berry aneurysm, an intracerebral arteriovenous fistula can rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. \\n\\nCongenital (developmental defect) \\n\\nRupture of arterial aneurysm into an adjacent vein \\n\\nPenetrating injuries \\n\\nInflammatory necrosis of adjacent vessels \\n\\nIntentionally created (for example, Cimino fistula as vascular access for hemodialysis). Blood must be aspirated from the body of the patient, and since arteries are not easy to reach compared to the veins, blood may be aspirated from veins. The problem is that the walls of the veins are thin compared to those of the arteries. The AV fistula is the solution for this problem because, after 4-6 weeks, the walls of the veins become thicker due to the high arterial pressure. Thus, this vein can now tolerate needles during hemodialysis sessions. \\n\\nWhen an arteriovenous fistula is formed involving a major artery like the abdominal aorta, it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance. This lowered peripheral resistance causes the heart to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues. The physical manifestations of this typically consist of a relatively normal systolic blood pressure accompanied by decreased diastolic blood pressure, resulting in a wider pulse pressure. \\n\\nNormal blood flow in the brachial artery is 85 to 110 milliliters per minute (mL/min). After the creation of a fistula, the blood flow increases to 400–500 mL/min immediately, and 700–1,000 mL/min within 1 month. A brachiocephalic fistula above the elbow has a greater flow rate than a radiocephalic fistula at the wrist. Both the artery and the vein dilate and elongate in response to the greater blood flow and shear stress, but the vein dilates more and becomes \" arterialized \" . In one study, the cephalic vein increased from 2.3 mm to 6.3 mm diameter after 2 months. When the vein is large enough to allow cannulation, the fistula is defined as \" mature \" . \\n\\nAn arteriovenous fistula can increase preload. AV shunts also decrease the afterload of the heart.

       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nCrimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease. Symptoms of CCHF may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding into the skin. Onset of symptoms is less than two weeks following exposure. Complications may include liver failure. In those who survive, recovery generally occurs around two weeks after onset. \\n\\nThe CCHF virus is typically spread by tick bites or contact with livestock carrying the disease. Those affected are often farmers or work in slaughterhouses. The virus can also spread between people via body fluids. Diagnosis is by detecting antibodies, the virus\\'s RNA, or the virus itself. It is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever. \\n\\nPrevention involves avoiding tick bites. A vaccine is not commercially available. Treatment is typically with supportive care. The medication ribavirin may also help. \\n\\nIt occurs in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. Often it occurs in outbreaks. In 2013 Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan documented more than fifty cases. The risk of death among those affected is between 10 and 40%. It was first detected in the 1940s. \\n\\nThe illness in humans is a severe form of hemorrhagic fever. Typically, after a 1–3 day incubation period following a tick bite or 5–6 days after exposure to infected blood or tissues, flu-like symptoms appear, which may resolve after one week. In up to 75% of cases, signs of bleeding can appear within 3–5 days of the onset of illness in case of bad containment of the first symptoms: mood instability, agitation, mental confusion and throat petechiae; and soon after nosebleeds, vomiting, and black stools. The liver becomes swollen and painful. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur, as well as acute kidney failure, shock, and sometimes acute respiratory distress syndrome. People usually begin to recover 9–10 days after first symptoms appear. Up to 30% of infected people die by the end of the second week of illness. \\n\\nThe Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus, family Nairoviridae of RNA viruses. Virus Taxonomy: 2018 Release, EC 50, Washington, DC, July 2018, Email ratification October 2018 (MSL #33) https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/ \\n\\nThe virions are 80–120 nanometers (nm) in diameter and are pleomorphic. There are no host ribosomes within the virion. Each virion contains three copies of the genome. The envelope is single layered and is formed from a lipid bilayer 5 nm thick. It has no protrusions. The envelope proteins form small projections ~5–10 nm long. The nucleocapsids are filamentous and circular with a length of 200–3000 nm. \\n\\nThe virus might enter a cell using the cell surface protein nucleolin. \\n\\nThe genome is circular, negative sense RNA in three parts – Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L). The L segment is 11–14.4 kilobases in length while the M and S segments are 4.4–6.3 and 1.7–2.1 kilobases long respectively. The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes the envelope glycoproteins (Gc and Gn), and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein. The mutation rates for the three parts of the genome were estimated to be: 1.09, 1.52 and 0.58 substitutions/site/year for the S, M, and L segments respectively. \\n\\nCCHFV is the most genetically diverse of the arboviruses: Its nucleotide sequences frequently differ between different strains, ranging from a 20% variability for the viral S segment to 31% for the M segment. Viruses with diverse sequences can be found within the same geographic area; closely related viruses have been isolated from widely separated regions, suggesting that viral dispersion has occurred possibly by ticks carried on migratory birds or through international livestock trade. Reassortment among genome segments during coinfection of ticks or vertebrates seems likely to have played a role in generating diversity in this virus. \\n\\nBased on the sequence data, seven genotypes of CCHFV have been recognised: Africa 1 (Senegal), Africa 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa), Africa 3 (southern and western Africa), Europe 1 (Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Russia and Turkey), Europe 2 (Greece), Asia 1 (the Middle East, Iran and Pakistan) and Asia 2 (China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). \\n\\nTicks are both \" environmental reservoir \" and vector for the virus, carrying it from wild animals to domestic animals and humans. Tick species identified as infected with the virus include Argas reflexus, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma marginatum marginatum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. \\n\\nAt least 31 different species of ticks from the genera Haemaphysalis and Hyalomma in southeastern Iran have been found to carry the virus. \\n\\nWild animals and small mammals, particularly European hare, Middle-African hedgehogs and multimammate rats are the \" amplifying hosts \" of the virus. Birds are generally resistant to CCHF, with the exception of ostriches. Domestic animals like sheep, goats and cattle can develop high titers of virus in their blood, but tend not to fall ill. \\n\\nThe \" sporadic infection \" of humans is usually caused by a Hyalomma tick bite. Animals can transmit the virus to humans, but this would usually be as part of a disease cluster. When clusters of illness occur, it is typically after people treat, butcher or eat infected livestock, particularly ruminants and ostriches. Outbreaks have occurred in abattoirs and other places where workers have been exposed to infected human or animal blood and fomites Humans can infect humans and outbreaks also occur in clinical facilities through infected blood and unclean medical instruments. \\n\\nWhere mammalian tick infection is common, agricultural regulations require de-ticking farm animals before transportation or delivery for slaughter. Personal tick avoidance measures are recommended, such as use of insect repellents, adequate clothing, and body inspection for adherent ticks. \\n\\nWhen feverish patients with evidence of bleeding require resuscitation or intensive care, body substance isolation precautions should be taken. \\n\\nSince the 1970s, several vaccine trials around the world against CCHF have been terminated due to high toxicity. \\n\\n, the only available and probably somewhat efficacious CCHF vaccine has been an inactivated antigen preparation then used in Bulgaria. No publication in the scientific literature related to this vaccine exists, which a Turkish virologist called suspicious both because antiquated technology and mouse brain were used to manufacture it. \\n\\nMore vaccines are under development, but the sporadic nature of the disease, even in endemic countries, suggests that large trials of vaccine efficacy will be difficult to perform. Finding volunteers may prove challenging, given growing anti-vaccination sentiment and resistance of populations to vaccination against contagious diseases. The number of people to be vaccinated, and the length of time they would have to be followed to confirm protection would have to be carefully defined. Alternatively, many scientists appear to believe that treatment of CCHF with ribavirin is more practical than prevention, but some recently conducted clinical trials appear to counter assumptions of drug efficacy. \\n\\nIn 2011, a Turkish research team led by Erciyes University successfully developed the first non-toxic preventive vaccine, which passed clinical trials. As of 2012, the vaccine was pending approval by the US FDA. \\n\\nSince the Ebola epidemic, the WHO jumpstarted a \" Blueprint for Research and Development preparedness \" on emerging pathogens with epidemic potential, against which there are no medical treatments. CCHF was the top priority on the initial list from December 2015, and is second as of January 2017. \\n\\nTreatment is mostly supportive. Ribavirin is effective in vitro and has been used by mouth during outbreaks, but there is no trial evidence to support its use. \\n\\nthe use of Immunoglobulin preparations has remained unproven and antibody engineering, which raised hopes for monoclonal antibody therapy, has remained in its infancy. \\n\\nThe United States armed forces maintain special stocks of ribavirin to protect personnel deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq from CCHF. \\n\\nCCHD occurs most frequently among agricultural workers, following the bite of an infected tick, and to a lesser extent among slaughterhouse workers exposed to the blood and tissues of infected livestock, and medical personnel through contact with the body fluids of infected persons. \\n\\nthe northern limit of CCHF has been 50 degrees northern latitude, north of which the Hyalomma ticks have not been found. \\n\\nPer a WHO map from 2008, Hyalomma ticks occurred south of this latitude across all of the Eurasian continent and Africa, sparing only the islands of Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Japan. \\n\\nSerological or virological evidence of CCHF was widespread in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East (except Israel, Lebanon and Jordan), central Africa, Western Africa, South Africa and Madagascar. \\n\\nIn 2008, more than 50 cases/year were reported from only 4 countries: Turkey, Iran, Russia and Uzbekistan. 5-49 cases/year were present in South Africa, Central Asia including Pakistan and Afghanistan (but sparing Turkmenistan), in the Middle East only the UAE and the Balkan countries limited to Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo-Albania. \\n\\nA 2014 map by the CDC shows endemic areas (in red) largely unchanged in Africa and the Middle East, but different for the Balkan, including all countries of the former Yugoslavia, and also Greece, but no longer Romania. India´s Northwestern regions of Rajastan and Gujarat saw their first cases. \\n\\nFrom 1995 to 2013, 228 cases of CCHF were reported in the Republic of Kosovo, with a case-fatality rate of 25.5%. \\n\\nBetween 2002–2008 the Ministry of Health of Turkey reported 3,128 CCHF cases, with a 5% death rate. In July 2005, authorities reported 41 cases of CCHF in central Turkey\\'s Yozgat Province, with one death. As of August 2008, a total of 50 deaths were reported for the year thus far in various cities in Turkey due to CCHF. \\n\\nIn September 2010, an outbreak was reported in Pakistan\\'s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Poor diagnosis and record keeping caused the extent of the outbreak to be uncertain, though some reports indicated over 100 cases, with a case-fatality rate above 10%. \\n\\nIn January 2011, the first human cases of CCHF in India was reported in Sanand, Gujarat, India, with 4 reported deaths, which included the index patient, treating physician and nurse. \\n\\n, 71 people were reported to have contracted the disease in Iran, resulting in 8 fatalities. \\n\\nIn October 2012, a British man died from the disease at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He had earlier been admitted to Gartnavel General Hospital in Glasgow, after returning on a flight from Kabul in Afghanistan. \\n\\nIn July 2013, seven persons died due to CCHF in Kariyana village in Babra taluka, Amreli district, Gujarat, India. \\n\\nIn August 2013, a farmer from Agago, Uganda was treated at Kalongo Hospital for a confirmed CCHF infection. The deaths of three other individuals in the northern region were suspected to have been caused by the virus. Another unrelated CCHF patient was admitted to Mulago Hospital on the same day. The Ministry of Health announced on the 19th that the outbreak was under control, but the second patient, a 27-year-old woman from Nansana, died on the 21st. She is believed to have contracted the virus from her husband, who returned to Kampala after being treated for CCHF in Juba, South Sudan. \\n\\nIn June 2014, cases were diagnosed in Kazakhstan. Ten people, including an ambulance crew, were admitted on to hospital in southern Kazakhstan with suspected CCHF. \\n\\nIn July 2014 an 8th person was found to be infected with CCHF at Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Pakistan. The eight patients, including a nurse and 6 Afghan nationals, died between April and July 2014. \\n\\n, sporadic confirmed cases have been reported from Bhuj, Amreli, Sanand, Idar and Vadnagar in Gujarat, India. In November 2014, a doctor and a labourer in north Gujarat tested positive for the disease. In the following weeks, three more people died from CCHF. In March 2015, one more person died of CCHF in Gujarat. \\n\\nAs of 2015, among livestock, CCHF was recognized as \" widespread \" in India, only 4 years after the first human case had been diagnosed. \\n\\nIn August 2016, the first local case of CCHF in Western Europe occurred in Western Spain. A 62-year-old man, who had been bitten by a tick in Spain died on August 25, having infected a nurse. The tick bite occurred in the province of Ávila, 300 km away from the province of Cáceres, where CCHF viral RNA from ticks was amplified in 2010. \\n\\nit was unclear what specific ecology led to the Spanish cases. \\n\\nIn August 2016, a number of Pakistani news sources raised concerns regarding the disease. Between January and October 2016, CCHF outbreaks in Pakistan were reported with highest numbers of cases and deaths during August 2016, just before the festival of Eid-al-Adha (held on September 13–15 in 2016). It was hypothesized that the festival could play an important part as people could come into contact with domestic or imported animals potentially infected with CCHF virus. The Pakistani NIH showed there was no correlation, and that CCHF cases \\n\\nhave coincided with the peak tick proliferation during the preceding 8–10 years. \\n\\nThe virus may have evolved around 1500–1100 BC. It is thought that changing climate and agricultural practices near this time could be behind its evolution. \\n\\nIn the 12th century a case of a hemorrhagic disease reported from what is now Tajikistan may have been the first known case of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever. \\n\\nDuring the Crimean War, the disease was known as \" Crimean fever \" and contracted by many, including Florence Nightingale. \\n\\nIn 1944, Soviet scientists first identified the disease they called Crimean hemorrhagic fever in Crimea They established its viral etiology, but were unable to isolate the agent at that time. \\n\\nIn February 1967, virologists Jack Woodall, David Simpson, Ghislaine Courtois and others published initial reports on a virus they called the Congo virus. In 1956, the Congo virus had first been isolated by physician Ghislaine Courtois, head of the Provincial Medical Laboratory, Stanleyville, in the Belgian Congo. Strain V3010, isolated by Courtois, was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory (RFVL) in New York City and found to be identical to another strain from Uganda, but to no other named virus at that time. \\n\\nIn June 1967, Soviet virologist Mikhail Chumakov registered an isolate from a fatal case that occurred in Samarkand in the Catalogue of Arthropod-borne Viruses. \\n\\nIn 1969, the Russian strain, which Chumakov had sent to the RFVL, was published to be identical to the Congo virus. \\n\\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses proposed the name Congo–Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus, but the Soviets insisted on Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. In 1973, against all principles of scientific nomenclature based on priority of publication, it was adopted as the official name, in possibly the first instance of a virus losing its name to politics and the Cold War. Since then, Congo–Crimean or just Congo virus has been used in many reports, which would be missed in searches of medical databases using the official name. \\n\\nThese reports include records of the occurrence of the virus or antibodies to the virus from Greece, Portugal, South Africa, Madagascar (the first isolation from there), the Maghreb, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. \\n\\nWorld Health Organization Fact Sheet',\n",

(8 March 2011). Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. In R. A. Pagon, T. D. Bird, C. R. Dolan, & K. Stephens (Eds.), GeneReviews. Seattle, WA: University of Washington. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1196/ which results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower extremities. The symptoms are caused by a genetic mutation that results in an expansion of abnormal \" CAG \" trinucleotide repeats in the ATXN3 gene that results in an abnormal form of the protein ataxin which causes degeneration of cells in the hindbrain. Some symptoms, such as clumsiness and rigidity, make MJD commonly mistaken for drunkenness or Parkinson\\'s disease. \\n\\nMachado–Joseph disease is a type of spinocerebellar ataxia and is the most common cause of autosomal-dominant ataxia. MJD causes ophthalmoplegia and mixed sensory and cerebellar ataxia. \\n\\nSymptoms of MJD are memory deficits, spasticity, difficulty with speech and swallowing, weakness in arms and legs, clumsiness, frequent urination and involuntary eye movements. Symptoms can begin in early adolescence and they get worse over time. Eventually, MJD leads to paralysis; however, intellectual functions usually remain the same. \\n\\nFlores and São Miguel are centers of the Machado–Joseph disease in the Azores. \\n\\nMachado Joseph\\'s disease has multiple origins as SCA3 comes from haplotype of four different origins and was not from one origin in the Azores. Japan, Brazil and France all have been founder effects in areas with SCA3. \\n\\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) on the Azores are believed to have come from Portugal\\'s northeast where Sephardic Jews lived. \\n\\nBelgium, French-Guiana and Algeria have their own MJD mutation origins. Portuguese have two mutations, while Brazil and France have one mutation, and Germans make up the majority of MJD patients in the United States. Azorean MJD sufferers have their locus on the 14q24.3-32 chromosome, the same as some Japanese with MJD. It was an Azorean, William Machado, whose offspring in New England were the first to be diagnosed with MJD. The Azorean Joseph family, living in California, were also diagnosed with MJD. The same origin for MJD is found in the Azores and in America\\'s north-west coast. Not only Portuguese have it since African Americans, Indians, Italians and Japanese also developed MJD. \\n\\nIn China, the mutation causing SCA type 3 has been estimated to have occurred 8,000 to 17,000 years ago. \\n\\nIn Japan, the oldest causative mutation appears to have occurred about 5774 +/- 1116 years ago. \\n\\nAmong aboriginal Australians, the founder mutation appears to have occurred about 7000 years ago. As this mutation is shared with other families based in Asia it seems likely that it was imported into Australia. \\n\\nMJD affected Azoreans and Japanese had haplotypes in common while Azoreans also had haplotypes of two different origins. \\n\\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in the ATXN3 gene, which is located on chromosome 14q (14q32.1). In exon 10 the gene contains lengthy irregular repetitions of the code \" CAG \" , producing a mutated protein called ataxin-3. (Normally, the number of copies is between 13 and 41.) MJD is an autosomal dominant disease, meaning that if either parent gives the defective gene to a child, the child will show symptoms of the disease. Therefore, if one parent suffers from this disease and the other parent does not, there will be a 50% chance of their child inheriting the disease. \\n\\nThe pons (a structure located on the brain stem) is one of the areas affected by MJD. The striatum (a brain area connected to balance and movement) is also affected by this disease, which could explain both of the main motor problems cause by MJD: the tightening and twisting of the limb and the abrupt, irregular movements. \\n\\nIn affected cells, this protein builds up and assembles intranuclear inclusion bodies. These insoluble aggregates are hypothesized to interfere with the normal activity of the nucleus and induce the cell to degenerate and die. \\n\\nMJD can be diagnosed by recognizing the symptoms of the disease and by taking a family history. Physicians ask patients questions about the kind of symptoms relatives with the disease had, the progression and harshness of symptoms, and the ages of onset in family members. \\n\\nPresymptomatic diagnosis of MJD can be made with a genetic test. The direct detection of the genetic mutation responsible for MJD has been available since 1995. Genetic testing looks at the number of CAG repeats within the coding region of the MJD/ATXN3 gene on chromosome 14. The test will show positive for MJD if this region contains 61-87 repeats, as opposed to the 12-44 repeats found in healthy individuals. A limitation to this test is that if the number of CAG repeats in an individual being tested falls between the healthy and pathogenic ranges (45-60 repeats), then the test cannot predict whether an individual will have MJD symptoms. \\n\\nThere are five sub-types of MJD that are characterized by the age of onset and range of symptoms. \\n\\nThe sub-types illustrate a wide variety of symptoms that patients can experience. However, assigning individuals to a specific sub-type of the disease is of limited clinical significance. \\n\\nType I affects approximately 13% of individuals with MJD and has onset of symptoms between the ages of 10 and 30 years old. It usually progresses quickly, with patients experiencing severe rigidity and dystonia. \\n\\nType II is the most common sub-type, affecting approximately 57% of individuals with MJD and symptoms typically begin between 20 and 50 years of age. It has an intermediate rate of progression and causes symptoms that include ataxia and spasticity, along with other upper motor neuron signs such as exaggerated deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). \\n\\nType III occurs in approximately 30% of MJD patients and has a relatively slow progression, with symptoms typically arising between the ages of 40 and 70. Symptoms include muscle twitching and cramps, unpleasant sensations such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and hands, and limb muscle atrophy. Nearly all patients experience a decline in their vision experienced as blurred vision, double vision, inability to control eye movements, and/or loss of capability to distinguish color. Some patients also experience Parkinsonian symptoms. \\n\\nType IV is distinguished by Parkinsonian symptoms that respond particularly well to levodopa treatment. \\n\\nType V appears to resemble Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia; however, more research is needed to conclude the relationship between Type V MJD and hereditary spastic paraplegia. \\n\\nThere is no cure for Machado-Joseph Disease. However, treatments are available for some symptoms. For example, spasticity can be reduced with antispasmodic drugs, such as baclofen. The Parkinsonian symptoms can be treated with levodopa therapy. Prism glasses can reduce diplopic symptoms. Physiotherapy/Physical Therapy and/or occupational therapy can help patients by prescribing mobility aids to increase the patients\\' independence, providing gait training, and prescribing exercises to maintain the mobility of various joints and general health to decrease the likelihood of falls or injuries as a result of falls. Walkers and wheelchairs can greatly help the patient with everyday tasks. Some patients will experience difficulties with speech and swallowing, therefore a Speech-Language Pathologist can assist the patients to improve their communicating abilities and their issues with swallowing. \\n\\nPatients with severe forms of MJD have a life expectancy of approximately 35 years. Those with mild forms have a normal life expectancy. The cause of death of those who die early is often aspiration pneumonia. \\n\\nThe disease was first identified in 1972. \\n\\nUnlike many other medical conditions, Machado–Joseph disease is not named after researchers. It is named after two men ( \" William Machado \" and \" Antone Joseph \" ) who were the patriarchs of the families in which the condition was initially described. The highest prevalence of the condition is on Australia\\'s Groote Eylandt where 5% of the population are currently symptomatic or at risk, followed by the Azorean island of Flores where around 1 in 140 individuals in the population are diagnosed with MJD. \\n\\nBrazilian comedian, actor and TV personality Guilherme Karam was diagnosed with Machado–Joseph disease, having inherited it from his mother, like his brother and sister. He died on 7 July 2016. \\n\\nIn a video on Facebook just days after Karam\\'s death, Brazilian personality, journalist and television presenter, Arnaldo Duran publicly acknowledged his affliction with Machado-Joseph. Brazilian press gave huge attention to both cases. \\n\\nEthicists have used Machado–Joseph disease as a paradigmatic illness to discuss the rights of a community of patients to control \" ownership \" of their disease, particularly when it comes to research on genetic testing. Also, as there currently is no clinical intervention to prevent the onset of the disease symptoms, there is discourse over whether individuals should get tested or not. The benefits of having MJD testing include a reduction in anxiety and uncertainty, and the ability to plan for the future. Some disadvantages include the anticipation of negative results and the individual\\'s difficulties in adapting to this outcome. \\n\\nFor an ethnographic case study exploring some of the social and ethical consequences of living with Machado–Joseph disease, see João Biehl\\'s Vita: Life in a Zone of Social Abandonment (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006). \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': \"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation breathing machines in hospitals. As such, VAP typically affects critically ill persons that are in an intensive care unit (ICU). VAP is a major source of increased illness and death. Persons with VAP have increased lengths of ICU hospitalization and have up to a 20–30% death rate. The diagnosis of VAP varies among hospitals and providers but usually requires a new infiltrate on chest x-ray plus two or more other factors. These factors include temperatures of > 38 °C or 12 × 10 9 /ml, purulent secretions from the airways in the lung, and/or reduction in gas exchange. \\n\\nA different less studied infection found in mechanically ventilated people is ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). As with VAP, tracheobronchial infection can colonise the trachea and travel to the bronchi. VAT may be a risk factor for VAP. \\n\\nPeople who are on mechanical ventilation are often sedated and are rarely able to communicate. As such, many of the typical symptoms of pneumonia will either be absent or unable to be obtained. The most important signs are fever or low body temperature, new purulent sputum, and hypoxemia (decreasing amounts of oxygen in the blood). However, these symptoms may be similar for tracheobronchitis. \\n\\nRisk factors for VAP include underlying heart or lung disease, neurologic disease, and trauma, as well as modifiable risk factors such as whether the head of the bed is flat (increased risk) or raised, whether the patient had an aspiration event before intubation, and prior antibiotic exposure. Patients who are in the ICU for head trauma or other severe neurologic illness, as well as patients who are in the ICU for blunt or penetrating trauma, are at especially high risk of developing VAP. Further, patients hospitalized for blunt trauma are at a higher risk of developing VAP compared to patients with penetrating trauma. \\n\\nVentilator-associated tracheobronchitis may be a risk factor for VAP, though not all cases of VAT progress to VAP. \\n\\nThe microbiologic flora responsible for VAP is different from that of the more common community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In particular, viruses and fungi are uncommon causes in people who do not have underlying immune deficiencies. Though any microorganism that causes CAP can cause VAP, there are several bacteria which are particularly important causes of VAP because of their resistance to commonly used antibiotics. These bacteria are referred to as multidrug resistant (MDR). \\n\\n:Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common MDR Gram-negative bacterium causing VAP. Pseudomonas has natural resistance to many antibiotics and has been known to acquire resistance to every antibiotic except for polymyxin B. Resistance is typically acquired through upregulation or mutation of a variety of efflux pumps which pump antibiotics out of the cell. Resistance may also occur through loss of an outer membrane porin channel (OprD) \\n\\n:Klebsiella pneumoniae has natural resistance to some beta-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin. Resistance to cephalosporins and aztreonam may arise through induction of a plasmid-based extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or plasmid-based ampC-type enzyme \\n\\n:Serratia marcescens has an ampC gene which can be induced by exposure to antibiotics such as cephalosporins. Thus, culture sensitivities may initially indicate appropriate treatment which fails due to bacterial response. \\n\\n:Enterobacter as a group also have an inducible ampC gene. Enterobacter may also develop resistance by acquiring plasmids. \\n\\n:Citrobacter also has an inducible ampC gene. \\n\\n:Stenotrophomonas maltophilia often colonizes people who have tracheal tubes but can also cause pneumonia. It is often resistant to a wide array of antibiotics but is usually sensitive to co-trimoxazole \\n\\n:Acinetobacter are becoming more common and may be resistant to carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem \\n\\n:Burkholderia cepacia is an important organism in people with cystic fibrosis and is often resistant to multiple antibiotics \\n\\n:Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an increasing cause of VAP. As many as fifty percent of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the intensive care setting are resistant to methicillin. Resistance is conferred by the mecA gene. \\n\\n:The development of molecular diagnostic techniques is changing the understanding of the microbiology of VAP, with an increasing appreciation of the role of hard to culture bacteria and the change in the lung microbiome. A recent finding has highlighted the presence of Mycoplasma in the lavage of patients with VAP, a finding which was largely absent from ventilated patients without VAP and healthy controls. The Mycoplasma species most commonly identified, Mycoplasma salivarium, was able to impair the antibacterial functions of monocytes and macrophages. \\n\\nIt is thought by many, that VAP primarily occurs because the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube allows free passage of bacteria into the lower segments of the lung in a person who often has underlying lung or immune problems. Bacteria travel in small droplets both through the endotracheal tube and around the cuff. Often, bacteria colonize the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube and are embolized into the lungs with each breath. Bacteria may also be brought down into the lungs with procedures such as deep suctioning or bronchoscopy. Another possibility is that the bacteria already exist in the mucus lining the bronchial tree, and are just kept in check by the body's first line of defenses. Ciliary action of the cells lining the trachea drive the mucus superiorly, leading to a build-up of fluids around the inflated cuff where there is little to no airway clearance. The bacteria can then colonize easily without disturbance and then rise in numbers enough to become infective. The droplets that are driven into the airstream and into the lung fields are lofted by way of Bernoulli's principle. There is also a condition called oxidative damage that occurs when concentrations of pure oxygen come into prolonged contact with cells and this damages the cilia of the cells, thus inhibiting their action as part of the body's first line of defense. \\n\\nWhether bacteria also travel from the sinuses or the stomach into the lungs is, as of 2005, controversial. However, spread to the lungs from the blood stream or the gut is uncommon. \\n\\nOnce inside the lungs, bacteria then take advantage of any deficiencies in the immune system (such as due to malnutrition or chemotherapy) and multiply. Patients with VAP demonstrate impaired function of key immune cells, including the neutrophil, both in the blood and in the alveolar space, with this impairment being driven by pro-inflammatory molecules such as C5a. These defects in immune function appear to be casually linked to the development of VAP, as they are seen before clinical infection develops. A combination of bacterial damage and consequences of the immune response lead to disruption of gas exchange with resulting symptoms. \\n\\nDiagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is difficult and is not standardized. The criteria used for diagnosis of VAP varies by institution, but tends to be a combination of several of the following radiographic, clinical sign, and laboratory evidence: \\n\\n, Temperature greater than 38 °C or less than 36 °C \\n\\n, White blood cell count greater than 12,000/mm 3 or less than 4,000/mm 3 \\n\\n, Purulent secretions, increased secretions, or change in secretions \\n\\n, Positive tracheal cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage cultures \\n\\n, Some sign of respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, abnormal breathing sounds when listening with stethoscope \\n\\n, Increased need for oxygen on the ventilator \\n\\n, Chest X-rays: at least two serial x-rays showing sustained or worsening shadowing (infiltrates or consolidations) \\n\\n, Positive cultures that were obtained directly from the lung environment, such as from the trachea or bronchioles \\n\\nAs an example, some institutions may require one clinical symptoms such as shortness of breath, one clinical sign such as fever, plus evidence on chest xray and in tracheal cultures. \\n\\nThere is no gold standard for getting cultures to identify the bacteria, virus, or fungus that is causing the pneumonia, and there are invasive and non-invasive strategies for obtaining the culture sample. One non-invasive strategy collects cultures from the trachea of people with symptoms of VAP. Another is more invasive and advocates a bronchoscopy plus bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for people with symptoms of VAP. Both strategies also require a new or enlarging infiltrate on chest x-ray as well as clinical signs/symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath. There is no strong evidence to suggest that an invasive method to collect cultures is more effective than a non-invasive method. In addition, a quantitative approach to assessing the culture (performing a bacterial count of the pathogen that is causing the pneumonia) does not appear to be superior to a qualitative approach (determining the presence of the pathogen). In recent years there has been a focus on rapid diagnostics, allowing for detection of significant levels of pathogens before this becomes apparent on microbial cultures. Several approaches have been used, including using host biomarkers such as IL-1β and IL-8. Alternatively, molecular detection of bacteria has been undertaken, with reports that amplifying the pan-bacterial 16S gene can provide a measure of bacterial load. A trial of biomarker-based exclusion of VAP (VAP-RAPID2) has recently finished recruitment, and results are awaited (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01972425). \\n\\nBlood cultures may reveal the microorganisms causing VAP, but are often not helpful as they are positive in only 25% of clinical VAP cases. Even in cases with positive blood cultures, the bacteremia may be from a source other than the lung infection. \\n\\nPrevention of VAP involves limiting exposure to resistant bacteria, discontinuing mechanical ventilation as soon as possible, and a variety of strategies to limit infection while intubated. Resistant bacteria are spread in much the same ways as any communicable disease. Proper hand washing, sterile technique for invasive procedures, and isolation of individuals with known resistant organisms are all mandatory for effective infection control. A variety of aggressive weaning protocols to limit the amount of time a person spends intubated have been proposed. One important aspect is limiting the amount of sedation that a ventilated person receives. \\n\\nWeak evidence suggests that raising the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees may help prevent VAP, however further research is required to understand the risks associated with this. Antiseptic mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine may also reduce the risk of VAP, although the evidence is mainly restricted to those who have undergone cardiac surgery. \\n\\nAmerican and Canadian guidelines strongly recommend the use of supraglottic secretion drainage (SSD). Special tracheal tubes with an incorporated suction lumen as the EVAC tracheal tube form Covidien / Mallinckrodt can be used for that reason. New cuff technology based on polyurethane material in combination with subglottic drainage (SealGuard Evac tracheal tube from Covidien/Mallinckrodt)showed significant delay in early and late onset of VAP. \\n\\nThere is little evidence that the use of silver-coated endotracheal tubes reduces the incidence of VAP in the first ten days of ventilation. There is tentative evidence that the use of probiotics may reduced the likelihood of getting VAP, however it is unclear if probiotics affect ICU or in-hospital death. \\n\\nTreatment of VAP should be matched to known causative bacteria. However, when VAP is first suspected, the bacteria causing infection is typically not known and broad-spectrum antibiotics are given (empiric therapy) until the particular bacterium and its sensitivities are determined. Empiric antibiotics should take into account both the risk factors a particular individual has for resistant bacteria as well as the local prevalence of resistant microorganisms. If a person has previously had episodes of pneumonia, information may be available about prior causative bacteria. The choice of initial therapy is therefore entirely dependent on knowledge of local flora and will vary from hospital to hospital. Treatment of VAP with a single antibiotic has been reported to result in similar outcomes as with a combination of more than one antibiotics, in terms of cure rates, duration of ICU stay, mortality and adverse effects. \\n\\nRisk factors for infection with an MDR strain include ventilation for more than five days, recent hospitalization (last 90 days), residence in a nursing home, treatment in a hemodialysis clinic, and prior antibiotic use (last 90 days). \\n\\nPossible empirical therapy combinations include (but are not limited to): \\n\\nvancomycin/linezolid and ciprofloxacin, \\n\\ncefepime and gentamicin/amikacin/tobramycin \\n\\nvancomycin/linezolid and ceftazidime \\n\\nUreidopenicillin plus β-lactamase inhibitor such as piperacillin/tazobactam or ticarcillin/clavulanate \\n\\na carbapenem (e.g., imipenem or meropenem) \\n\\nTherapy is typically changed once the causative bacteria are known and continued until symptoms resolve (often 7 to 14 days). For patients with VAP not caused by nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (like Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) the available evidence seems to support the use of short-course antimicrobial treatments ( < or =10 days). \\n\\nPeople who do not have risk factors for MDR organisms may be treated differently depending on local knowledge of prevalent bacteria. Appropriate antibiotics may include ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ampicillin/sulbactam. \\n\\nAs of 2005, there is ongoing research into inhaled antibiotics as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Tobramycin and polymyxin B are commonly used in certain centres but there is no clinical evidence to support their use. \\n\\nVAP occurring early after intubation typically involves fewer resistant organisms and is thus associated with a more favorable outcome. Because respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is itself associated with a high mortality, determination of the exact contribution of VAP to mortality has been difficult. As of 2006, estimates range from 33% to 50% death in patients who develop VAP. Mortality is more likely when VAP is associated with certain microorganisms (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter), blood stream infections, and ineffective initial antibiotics. VAP is especially common in people who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). \\n\\nBetween 8 and 28% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation are affected by VAP. VAP can develop at any time during ventilation, but occurs most often in the first week of mechanical ventilation. There is some evidence for gender differences in the course of VAP: men have been found to get VAP more often, but women are more likely to die after contracting VAP. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'parsed_text': \"Ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the neuromuscular junction resulting in hallmark variability in muscle weakness and fatigability. MG is an autoimmune disease where anomalous antibodies are produced against the naturally occurring acetylcholine receptors in voluntary muscles. MG may be limited to the muscles of the eye (ocular MG), leading to abrupt onset of weakness/fatigability of the eyelids or eye movement. MG may also involve other muscle groups (generalized MG). \\n\\nAlthough these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing, about 90% of MG patients eventually have eye involvement. The most common symptoms are double vision (diplopia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis), whereas the pupil is always spared. Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye, limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle. Ptosis occurs when the levator palpebrae superioris (the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation) is affected on one or both sides, leading to eyelid drooping. Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well-rested patients, weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles (e.g. by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds). \\n\\nIn 75% of MG cases, the initial manifestation is in the eye. Within 2 years, 80% of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups, thereby developing generalized MG. If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years, there is a 94% likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize. \\n\\nAside from asymmetric ptosis (which becomes worse with fatigue, sustained upgaze, and at the end of the day) and variable limitation of extraocular muscles/diplopia, other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze-evoked nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, oscillatory motion of the eyeball) and Cogan’s lid twitch (upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10–15 seconds). \\n\\nNormally, muscle contraction is a result of electrical signals sent from the central nervous system to muscle fibers via nerve impulses. At the neuromuscular junction, this electrical message is converted into a chemical message as acetylcholine is released from nerve fibers and attaches to corresponding receptors on the muscle fiber. \\n\\nIn MG, antibodies are produced that block acetylcholine receptors, preventing the molecule from binding to the receptor and leading to a breakdown in communication between the nervous system and the muscle, resulting in muscle fatigue, and sometimes paralysis. Autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors are detectable in 70–90% of patients with generalized MG, but only 50% in ocular MG. \\n\\nThe precise reasons for the preferential involvement of eye muscles in MG is not well understood, but there are several lines of thought. \\n\\nFunctional hypotheses propose that although multiple muscles may be affected, a deficit may be more readily apparent in the eyes for several reasons. Slight weakness in a limb may be tolerated, but slight weakness in the extraocular muscles would lead to misalignment of the two eyes, even a small degree of which could lead to diplopia. Eyes may also be less able to adapt to variable weakness, because extraocular muscles use visual rather than proprioceptive (body position-sensing) cues for fine-tuning. \\n\\nImmunologic hypotheses proposes that there may be differences in the antibodies in ocular MG versus generalized MG that may favor the muscles responsible for eye movement and eyelid elevation. \\n\\nPhysiologic hypotheses propose that it is the unique structure and function of extraocular muscles that predispose them to weakness in MG. Compared to extremity muscles, extraocular muscles are smaller, served by more nerve fibers, and are among the fastest contracting muscles in the body. This higher level of activity may predispose them to fatigue in MG. Additionally, some reports indicate that there may be fewer acetylcholine receptors in extraocular muscles versus limb muscles. \\n\\nThe variable course of MG may make the diagnosis difficult. In brief, the diagnosis of MG relies mostly on the patient's history and physical findings, with particular attention to neurologic, eye motility, and eyelid exams. Frequently, patients will describe experiencing alternating ptosis (lid droop in one eye that gets better, then is followed by ptosis in the other eye), as well as diplopia that worsens during the day (with increasing extraocular muscle fatigue). \\n\\nA tensilon (edrophonium chloride) test can be used, which temporarily blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine, and briefly relieves weakness; however, false-negative results are common. Single-fiber electromyography can be used to electrically stimulate single muscle fibers to determine if there is muscle weakness present. The diagnosis of MG can also be confirmed with blood work that measures the amount of blocking antibody present, but only 70% of ocular MG patients have detectable antibody levels. Additional lab and image tests for commonly associated thyroid, thymus and autoimmune diseases are also advisable. \\n\\nThe prognosis tends to be good for patients with MG. It is often best not to treat mild cases of MG. Management necessitates avoidance of medications that can worsen neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, beta-blockers, chloroquine, anti-arrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, some anticonvulsants and intravenous iodinated contrast should be avoided. \\n\\nMG is characteristically variable in course, with the frequency of diplopia and ptosis affected by environmental, emotional and physical factors such as bright sunlight, stress, viral illness, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. Spontaneous remission can occur in any patient and remain for years. In a study of the natural history of generalized MG among 168 patients (with an average follow-up of 12 years), 14% experienced complete remission. \\n\\nPatients with mild-to-moderate ocular myasthenia are usually treated initially with oral anticholinesterase agents, Mestinon (pyridostigmine) being the most commonly employed. There have not been any randomized clinical trials conducted with these agents, and this treatment is often unsuccessful, particularly in resolving diplopia. Immunosuppressive therapy is then started and the agent of choice is usually prednisone. In a small controlled study this drug demonstrated greater efficacy than pyridostigmine. Steroid therapy is controversial, but in another study the results suggested that prednisone does decrease progression to generalized MG. There is no single recommended dosing regimen in light of the side effects commonly associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy, and the difficulty in weaning patients from steroids without exacerbation of symptoms. Response to prednisone therapy is variable. \\n\\nAdditionally, MG patients should be examined for thymomas, and if found, should undergo surgery to address this condition. A prophylactic thymectomy is controversial, but has been shown to be helpful in young MG patients with acute disease within 3 years of disease onset, in patients with enlarged thymus glands and for whom surgery is low-risk, and patients with generalized MG who are unresponsive to medical treatment. \\n\\nThe symptoms of ocular MG can also be addressed by non-medicinal means. Ptosis can be corrected with placement of crutches on eyeglasses and with ptosis tape to elevate eyelid droop. Diplopia can be addressed by occlusion with eye patching, frosted lens, occluding contact lens, or by simply placing opaque tape over a portion of eyeglasses. Also, plastic prisms (Fresnel prisms) can be attached to eyeglasses of a diplopic patient, allowing for alignment of vision from both eyes in the affected direction, but are often problematic if the degree of muscle weakness, and therefore ocular misalignment, fluctuates frequently. \\n\\nIn contrast to generalized MG, purely ocular MG occurs equally among females and males, has a higher incidence in persons of Korean descent, and is likely associated with thyroid disease, thymomas (20% incidence), and other autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, and thyroid ophthalmopathy. \\n\\nSpector RH.

       "   'parsed_text': \"Respiratory disease, or lung disease, is a medical term that encompasses pathological conditions affecting the organs and tissues that make gas exchange difficult in air-breathing animals. They include conditions of the respiratory tract including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, pleurae, pleural cavity, and the nerves and muscles of respiration. Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, to life-threatening diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute asthma and lung cancer. \\n\\nThe study of respiratory disease is known as pulmonology. A doctor who specializes in respiratory disease is known as a pulmonologist, a chest medicine specialist, a respiratory medicine specialist, a respirologist or a thoracic medicine specialist. \\n\\nRespiratory diseases can be classified in many different ways, including by the organ or tissue involved, by the type and pattern of associated signs and symptoms, or by the cause of the disease. \\n\\nAsthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD including emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, is tobacco smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known. \\n\\nRestrictive lung diseases are a category of respiratory disease characterized by a loss of lung compliance, causing incomplete lung expansion and increased lung stiffness, such as in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. \\n\\nChronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are long-term diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. They are characterized by a high inflammatory cell recruitment (neutrophil) and/or destructive cycle of infection, (e.g. mediated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Some of the most common are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment that help dilate major air passages and improve shortness of breath can help control symptoms and increase the quality of life. \\n\\nInfections can affect any part of the respiratory system. They are traditionally divided into upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections. \\n\\nThe most common upper respiratory tract infection is the common cold. However, infections of specific organs of the upper respiratory tract such as sinusitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, pharyngitis and laryngitis are also considered upper respiratory tract infections. \\n\\nThe most common lower respiratory tract infection is pneumonia, an infection of the lungs which is usually caused by bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae in Western countries. Worldwide, tuberculosis is an important cause of pneumonia. Other pathogens such as viruses and fungi can cause pneumonia for example severe acute respiratory syndrome and pneumocystis pneumonia. A pneumonia may develop complications such as a lung abscess, a round cavity in the lung caused by the infection, or may spread to the pleural cavity. \\n\\nPoor oral care may be a contributing factor to lower respiratory disease. New research suggests bacteria from gum disease travel through airways and into the lungs. \\n\\nMalignant tumors of the respiratory system, particularly primary carcinomas of the lung, are a major health problem responsible for 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 30% of all cancer deaths. The majority of respiratory system cancers are attributable to smoking tobacco. \\n\\nThe major histological types of respiratory system cancer are: \\n\\nSmall cell lung cancer \\n\\nNon-small cell lung cancer \\n\\nAdenocarcinoma of the lung \\n\\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the lung \\n\\nLarge cell lung carcinoma \\n\\nOther lung cancers (carcinoid, Kaposi’s sarcoma, melanoma) \\n\\nLymphoma \\n\\nHead and neck cancer \\n\\nPleural mesothelioma, almost always caused by exposure to asbestos dust. \\n\\nIn addition, since many cancers spread via the bloodstream and the entire cardiac output passes through the lungs, it is common for cancer metastases to occur within the lung. Breast cancer may invade directly through local spread, and through lymph node metastases. After metastasis to the liver, colon cancer frequently metastasizes to the lung. Prostate cancer, germ cell cancer and renal cell carcinoma may also metastasize to the lung. \\n\\nTreatment of respiratory system cancer depends on the type of cancer. Surgical removal of part of a lung (lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection) or of an entire lung pneumonectomy), along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are all used. The chance of surviving lung cancer depends on the cancer stage at the time the cancer is diagnosed, and to some extent on the histology, and is only about 14-17% overall. In the case of metastases to the lung, treatment can occasionally be curative but only in certain, rare circumstances. \\n\\nBenign tumors are relatively rare causes of respiratory disease. Examples of benign tumors are: \\n\\nPulmonary hamartoma \\n\\nCongenital malformations such as pulmonary sequestration and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). \\n\\nPleural cavity diseases include pleural mesothelioma which are mentioned above. \\n\\nA collection of fluid in the pleural cavity is known as a pleural effusion. This may be due to fluid shifting from the bloodstream into the pleural cavity due to conditions such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis. It may also be due to inflammation of the pleura itself as can occur with infection, pulmonary embolus, tuberculosis, mesothelioma and other conditions. \\n\\nA pneumothorax is a hole in the pleura covering the lung allowing air in the lung to escape into the pleural cavity. The affected lung “collapses” like a deflated balloon. A tension pneumothorax is a particularly severe form of this condition where the air in the pleural cavity cannot escape, so the pneumothorax keeps getting bigger until it compresses the heart and blood vessels, leading to a life-threatening situation. \\n\\nPulmonary vascular diseases are conditions that affect the pulmonary circulation. Examples are: \\n\\nPulmonary embolism, a blood clot that forms in a vein, breaks free, travels through the heart and lodges in the lungs (thromboembolism). Large pulmonary emboli are fatal, causing sudden death. A number of other substances can also embolise (travel through the blood stream) to the lungs but they are much more rare: fat embolism (particularly after bony injury), amniotic fluid embolism (with complications of labour and delivery), air embolism (iatrogenic - caused by invasive medical procedures). \\n\\nPulmonary arterial hypertension, elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Most commonly it is idiopathic (i.e. of unknown cause) but it can be due to the effects of another disease, particularly COPD. This can lead to strain on the right side of the heart, a condition known as cor pulmonale. \\n\\nPulmonary edema, leakage of fluid from capillaries of the lung into the alveoli (or air spaces). It is usually due to congestive heart failure. \\n\\nPulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation and damage to capillaries in the lung resulting in blood leaking into the alveoli. This may cause blood to be coughed up. Pulmonary hemorrhage can be due to auto-immune disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Goodpasture's syndrome. \\n\\nPulmonary diseases may also impact newborns, such as pulmonary hyperplasia, pulmonary interstitial emphysema (usually preterm births), and infant respiratory distress syndrome, \\n\\nRespiratory diseases may be investigated by performing one or more of the following tests \\n\\nBiopsy of the lung or pleura \\n\\nBlood test \\n\\nBronchoscopy \\n\\nChest X-ray \\n\\nCT scan, including high-resolution computed tomography \\n\\nCulture of microorganisms from secretions such as sputum \\n\\nUltrasound scanning can be useful to detect fluid such as pleural effusion \\n\\nPulmonary function test \\n\\nVentilation—perfusion scan \\n\\nRespiratory disease is a common and significant cause of illness and death around the world. In the US, approximately one billion common colds occur each year. A study found that in 2010, there were approximately 6.8 million emergency department visits for respiratory disorders in the U.S. for patients under the age of 18. In 2012, respiratory conditions were the most frequent reasons for hospital stays among children. \\n\\nIn the UK, approximately 1 in 7 individuals are affected by some form of chronic lung disease, most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. \\n\\nRespiratory diseases (including lung cancer) are responsible for over 10% of hospitalizations and over 16% of deaths in Canada. \\n\\nIn 2011, respiratory disease with ventilator support accounted for 93.3% of ICU utilization in the United States. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Parinaud\\'s syndrome is an inability to move the eyes up and down. It is caused by compression of the vertical gaze center at the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF). The eyes lose the ability to move upward and down. \\n\\nIt is a group of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction. It is caused by lesions of the upper brain stem and is named for Henri Parinaud (1844–1905), considered to be the father of French ophthalmology. \\n\\nParinaud\\'s syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction, characterized by: \\n\\nParalysis of upwards gaze: Downward gaze is usually preserved. This vertical palsy is supranuclear, so doll\\'s head maneuver should elevate the eyes, but eventually all upward gaze mechanisms fail. \\n\\nPseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils: Accommodative paresis ensues, and pupils become mid-dilated and show light-near dissociation. \\n\\nConvergence-retraction nystagmus: Attempts at upward gaze often produce this phenomenon. On fast up-gaze, the eyes pull in and the globes retract. The easiest way to bring out this reaction is to ask the patient to follow down-going stripes on an optokinetic drum. \\n\\nEyelid retraction (Collier\\'s sign) \\n\\nConjugate down gaze in the primary position: \" setting-sun sign \" . Neurosurgeons see this sign most commonly in patients with failed hydrocephalus shunts. \\n\\nIt is also commonly associated with bilateral papilledema. It has less commonly been associated with spasm of accommodation on attempted upward gaze, pseudoabducens palsy (also known as thalamic esotropia) or slower movements of the abducting eye than the adducting eye during horizontal saccades, see-saw nystagmus and associated ocular motility deficits including skew deviation, oculomotor nerve palsy, trochlear nerve palsy and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. \\n\\nParinaud\\'s syndrome results from injury, either direct or compressive, to the dorsal midbrain. Specifically, compression or ischemic damage of the mesencephalic tectum, including the superior colliculus adjacent oculomotor (origin of cranial nerve III) and Edinger-Westphal nuclei, causing dysfunction to the motor function of the eye. \\n\\nClassically, it has been associated with three major groups: \\n\\nYoung patients with brain tumors in the pineal gland or midbrain: pinealoma (intracranial germinomas) are the most common lesion producing this syndrome. \\n\\nWomen in their 20s-30s with multiple sclerosis \\n\\nOlder patients following stroke of the upper brainstem \\n\\nHowever, any other compression, ischemia or damage to this region can produce these phenomena: obstructive hydrocephalus, midbrain hemorrhage, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, trauma and brainstem toxoplasmosis infection. Neoplasms and giant aneurysms of the posterior fossa have also been associated with the midbrain syndrome. \\n\\nVertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia has also been associated with metabolic disorders, such as Niemann-Pick disease, Wilson\\'s disease, kernicterus, and barbiturate overdose. \\n\\nTreatment is primarily directed towards etiology of the dorsal midbrain syndrome. A thorough workup, including neuroimaging is essential to rule out anatomic lesions or other causes of this syndrome. Visually significant upgaze palsy can be relieved with bilateral inferior rectus recessions. Retraction nystagmus and convergence movement are usually improved with this procedure as well. \\n\\nThe eye findings of Parinaud\\'s syndrome generally improve slowly over months, especially with resolution of the causative factor; continued resolution after the first 3–6 months of onset is uncommon. However, rapid resolution after normalization of intracranial pressure following placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt has been reported. \\n\\n',\n",

Chest pain, fatigue and sexual dysfunction are less common symptoms that may also occur.

However, a loss of cells in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord has been documented, as has a loss of catecholamine uptake and catecholamine fluorescence in sympathetic postganglionic neurons. In general, levels of catecholamines in these patients are very low while lying down, and do not increase much upon standing. \\n\\nPharmacological methods of treatment include fludrocortisone, midodrine, somatostatin, erythropoietin, and other vasopressor agents. However, often a patient with pure autonomic failure can mitigate his or her symptoms with far less costly means. Compressing the legs and lower body, through crossing the legs, squatting, or the use of compression stockings can help. Use of an abdominal binder is even more effective.

       "   'parsed_text': 'Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION or arteritic AION) is the cause of vision loss that occurs in temporal arteritis (aka giant-cell arteritis). Temporal arteritis is an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels that happens especially with advancing age. AAION occurs in about 15-20 percent of patients with temporal arteritis. Damage to the blood vessels supplying the optic nerves leads to insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the nerve and subsequent optic nerve fiber death. Most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss first to one eye. If the temporal arteritis is left untreated, the fellow eye will likely suffer vision loss as well within 1–2 weeks. Arteritic AION falls under the general category of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which also includes non-arteritic AION. AION is considered an eye emergency, immediate treatment is essential to rescue remaining vision. \\n\\nAn exhaustive review article published in March 2009 described the latest information on arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, both anterior (A-AION and NA-AION) and posterior (A-PION, NA-PION, and surgical). \\n\\nThere are several constitutional symptoms of temporal arteritis that may aid in diagnosis of AAION such as jaw claudication (spasms of the jaw muscle), scalp tenderness, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, myalgias and loss of appetite. However, many cases are asymptomatic. There are also elevations in three blood tests that help identify AAION: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP) and platelet count (thrombocytosis).

Treatment may prevent further damage (see below). Any patient diagnosed with non-arteritic AION over the age of 50 must be asked about the constitutional symptoms mentioned above. Furthermore, AION patients over the age of 75 should often be blood tested regardless. \\n\\nAAION requires urgent and critical intervention with a very long course of corticosteroids to prevent further damage.

       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis (OB), also known as constrictive bronchiolitis and popcorn lung, is a disease that results in obstruction of the smallest airways of the lungs (bronchioles) due to inflammation. Symptoms include a dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing and feeling tired. These symptoms generally get worse over weeks to months. It is not related to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, previously known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. \\n\\nCauses include breathing in toxic fumes, respiratory infections, connective tissue disorder or complications following a bone marrow or heart-lung transplant. Symptoms may not occur until two to eight weeks following toxic exposure or infection. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation that results in scar tissue formation. Diagnosis is by CT scan, pulmonary function tests or lung biopsy. A chest X-ray is often normal. \\n\\nWhile the disease is not reversible, treatments can slow further worsening. This may include the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication. A lung transplant may be offered. Outcomes are often poor, with most people dying in months to years. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis is rare in the general population. It, however, affects about 75% of people by ten years following a lung transplant and up to 10% of people who have received a bone marrow transplant from someone else. The condition was first clearly described in 1981. Prior descriptions occurred as early as 1956, with the term \" bronchiolitis obliterans \" used first by Reynaud in 1835. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis results in worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and a dry cough. The symptoms can start gradually, or severe symptoms can occur suddenly. These symptoms represent an obstructive pattern that is non-reversible with bronchodilator therapy, and need to be related to various lung insults. These insults include inhalation damage, post transplant auto-immune injury, post-infectious disease, drug reactions, and several auto-immune diseases. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis has many possible causes, including collagen vascular disease, transplant rejection in organ transplant patients, viral infection (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, HIV, cytomegalovirus), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Pneumocystis pneumonia, drug reaction, aspiration and complications of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and exposure to toxic fumes, including diacetyl, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, chlorine, thionyl chloride, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, phosgene, polyamide-amine dyes, mustard gas and ozone. It can also be present in patients with IBD, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, GERD, IgA nephropathy, and ataxia telangiectasia. Activated charcoal, have been known to cause it when aspirated. The ingestion of large doses of papaverine in the vegetable Sauropus androgynus has caused it. Additionally, the disorder may be idiopathic (without known cause). \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis is a common complication in lung transplant, because transplanted lungs are at greater risk of alloimmunization as compared to healthy lungs. The disease is often termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in the setting of post lung transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients who develop BOS post lung transplant vary in time frame and disease severity. Patients often initially have normal lung function on pulmonary function testing and have normal chest radiographs. As the disease progresses they begin to have symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing as their lung function declines. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation published updated guidelines in 2001 for grading the severity of BOS. The original guidelines and classification system were published in 1993 by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Their scoring system is based on the changes in FEV 1 in patients from their baseline. When patients are first diagnosed with BOS they have their baseline lung function established by doing pulmonary function testing at the time of diagnosis. The BOS scoring system is as follows: \\n\\nBOS 0: FEV 1 > 90% of baseline and FEF 25-75 > 75% of baseline \\n\\nBOS 0-p: FEV 1 81-89% of baseline and/or FEF 25-75 <= 75% of baseline \\n\\nBOS 1: FEV 1 66-80% of baseline \\n\\nBOS 2: FEV 1 51-65% of baseline \\n\\nBOS 3: FEV 1 50% or less of baseline \\n\\nThe scoring system shows an increased severity of the disease as the BOS number increases. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis affects up to 5.5% of people who have received HSCT. One of the biggest risk factors after HSCT is the development of GVHD with a 14% risk. Other risk factors post transplant including tobacco use, age of donor, age of recipient, lower baseline FEV1/FVC ratio, non-caucasian race, peripheral and lower circulating IgG levels. Studies have, however, shown mixed results regarding these other risk factors. There has been an association shown between the increased use of peripheral stem cells and the risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis. Also, research has shown an increased risk for developing the disease within the first year of transplant if the person is infected with respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus within the first 100 days post transplant. \\n\\nThere are many industrial inhalants that are known to cause various types of bronchiolitis, including obliterative bronchiolitis. \\n\\nIndustrial workers who have presented with bronchiolitis: \\n\\nnylon-flock workers \\n\\nworkers who spray prints onto textiles with polyamide-amine dyes \\n\\nbattery workers who are exposed to thionyl chloride fumes \\n\\nworkers at plants that use or manufacture flavorings such as diacetyl \\n\\nDiacetyl is a chemical used to produce the artificial butter flavoring in many foods such as candy and microwave popcorn and occurring naturally in wines. This first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri developed obliterative bronchiolitis. Due to this event, obliterative bronchiolitis began to be referred to in the popular media as \" popcorn lung \" or \" popcorn workers lung \" . It is also referred to as \" flavorings-related lung disease \" . \\n\\nTypically found in young children and is the most common cause at this age. Generally occurs after a viral infection of adenovirus (types 3, 7, and 21), measles (rubeola), mycoplasma, CMV, influenza, and parainfluenza. Swyer-James syndrome is a rare complication of obliterative bronchiolitis caused by measles or adenovirus. Post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis is most common in the southern hemisphere particularly in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Chile and New Zealand. There was a large prevalence of the disease in these areas during the 1990s and early 2000s. In one hospital in Buenos Aires, the Ricardo Gutiérrez Children\\'s hospital, the disease accounted for 14% of their inpatient respiratory population from 1993 to 2002. As such, much of the information about post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis has come from research out of South America. The most significant risk factors for the disease are infection with adenovirus and the need for ventilator support. In contrast with another cause of obliterative bronchiolitis in children, Steven\\'s Johnson\\'s syndrome, post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis tends to be a chronic but non-progressive disease. The disease can have varying impact on children and their quality of life, which has been studied by lung function tests, as well as their exercise tolerance. Children with lower lung function based on their pulmonary function testing, have lower exercise tolerance, which compounds the impact of the disease on cardiovascular function as they are not able to maintain age appropriate aerobic fitness. This ultimately affects their activities of daily living (ADLs) and their quality of life going forward. \\n\\nA form of constrictive bronchiolitis is starting to present in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It has been attributed to veterans being exposed to trash burn pits. Veterans present with shortness of breath and other asthma-like symptoms. The only way to diagnose this condition is by doing a lung biopsy as chest X-rays and CT scans come back as normal. The government still denies that there is any correlation between burn pits and health problems but the government has started an \" Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry \" to begin tracking the health of veterans who were exposed to burn pits to see if there is a connection. \\n\\nThe underlying mechanism involves injury and inflammation of epithelial and sub-epithelial cells. These cells then lose the ability to repair the tissue, in particular they lose the ability to regenerate the epithelial or outermost layer, leading to the excess growth of cells that cause scarring. There are multiple pathways of the disease including fibrotic, lymphocytic, and antibody-mediated that have been described. However, while each pathway has a more unique starting point and cause, the end result is still injury and inflammation leading to scarring of the lung tissue. The scarred tissue then makes the expiration phase of respiration more difficult, leading to air not being expelled from the lungs. This is termed \" air-trapping \" , which can be seen on medical imaging. Since the scarring is non-reversible, the disease generally does not improve over time, and depending on the inciting can progress to death. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis is often diagnosed based on the symptoms of obstructive lung disease following lung injury. The definitive diagnosis is through biopsy, but due to the variable distribution of lesions, leading to falsely negative tests, and invasive nature of this procedure it is often not performed. Several tests are often needed to diagnose obliterative bronchiolitis, including spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung tests (DLCO), lung volume tests, chest X-rays, high-resolution CT (HRCT), and lung biopsy. \\n\\nSpirometry tests usually show a obstructive pattern and is the most common presentation. A slightly reduced to normal forced vital capacity (FVC), and a reduced FEV 1 to FVC ratio and forced expiratory volume (FVC) with little to no correction with the use of bronchodialators are common findings. Lung volume tests may show hyperinflation (excessive air in lungs caused by air trapping). Diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) tests are usually normal; people with early-stage OB are more likely to have normal DLCO. \\n\\nFEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) should be above 80% of predicted values to be considered normal. Obliterative bronchiolitis reduces this to between 16% and 21%. \\n\\nEarly in the disease chest radiography is typically normal but may show hyperinflation. As the disease progresses a reticular pattern with thickening of airway walls may be present. HRCT can also show air trapping when the person being scanned breathes out completely; it can also show thickening in the airway and haziness in the lungs. A common finding on HRCT is patchy areas of decreased lung density, signifying reduced vascular caliber and air trapping. This pattern is often described as a \" mosaic pattern \" , and may indicate obliterative bronchiolitis. \\n\\nTransthoracic lung biopsies are preferable for diagnosis of constrictive BO compared to transbronchial biopsies; regardless of the type of biopsy, a diagnosis may only be achieved by examination of multiple samples. Transthoracic biopsies are preferred over transbronchial due to the heterogeneity and distribution of the lesions. OB can be further classified into two categories: constrictive or proliferative. The constrictive pattern is demonstrated by peribronchiolar cellular infiltrates which eventually causes small airway damage and leads to subepithelial fibrosis. The bronchial muscle can eventually become fibrosed which can be identified with trichrome staining. In regards to proliferative disease, intraluminal buds called \" Masson bodies \" fill the lumen, which results in bronchiolar plugging. Often people with proliferative disease will show butterfly wing-like appearance under microscopy. One key determinate that can be seen on biopsy to differentiate constrictive from proliferative disease is the extent of lesions. Both lesions are localized from the small bronchi to the membranous bronchi, but in constrictive disease the lesions are intermittent while proliferative disease has a continuous distribution. \\n\\nOther conditions that can present similarly include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pneumonia. \\n\\nDisease caused by exposure to industrial inhalants and burn pits can be prevented with the use of engineering controls (e.g., exhaust hoods or closed systems), personal protective equipment, monitoring of potentially affected personnel, worker education and training. \\n\\nThe primary prevention of obliterative bronchiolitis in people who have received either lung transplant or HSCT therapy is immunosuppression. In regards to post lung transplantion, the combination of calcineurin inhibitor combined with a purine synethesis inhibitor and a glucocorticoid is the general regimen used. People also have a baseline post-transplant lung function testing done in order to determine over time if their lung function is declining. People who are post HSCT their immunosuppressive regimen typically includes methotrexate in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor to prevent GVHD, a risk factor for developing obliterative bronchiolitis. \\n\\nWhile the disease is not reversible, treatments can slow further worsening. This may include the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication which may have an effect on the ability to receive a lung transplant if offered. If patients have difficulty breathing (hypoxemia) oxygen can be supplemented. Routine vaccinations are recommended for patients with chronic lung disease to prevent complications from secondary infections due to pneumonia and influenza. \\n\\nTransplant recipients are at risk for re-developing the disease, as obliterative bronchiolitis is a common complication of chronic rejection. Evaluation of interventions to prevent obliterative bronchiolitis relies on early detection of abnormal spirometry results or unusual decreases in repeated measurements. \\n\\n\" Bronchiolitis obliterans \" was originally a term used by pathologist to describe two patterns of airway disease. One was bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), also known as cryptogenic pneumonia, and the other is now known as obliterative bronchiolitis. The name cryptogenic obliterative (constrictive) bronchiolitis is used when a cause is unknown. \\n\\nObliterative bronchiolitis is also not to be confused with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). BOS is defined as a person who has had either a HSCT or lung transplant and develops symptoms or radiographic findings consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans, but has not been confirmed by biopsy. \\n\\n',\n",

The treatment of choice is surgical excision of the affected lymph nodes, with antibiotic treatment (usually clarithromycin and rifabutin for 18 to 24 months) reserved for those patients who cannot have surgery. \\n\\nMAC bacteria are common in the environment and cause infection when inhaled or swallowed. Recently, M. avium has been found to deposit and grow in bathroom shower heads from which it may be easily aerosolized and inhaled. \\n\\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC), also called Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, is a microbial complex of three Mycobacterium species (i.e. M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. chimaera. It causes Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Some sources also include Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). \\n\\nMAI is common in immunocompromised individuals, including senior citizens and those with HIV/AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis, the bronchial condition which causes pathological enlargement of the bronchial tubes, is commonly found with MAI infection. Whether the bronchiectasis leads to the MAC infection or is the result of it is not always known. \\n\\nThe Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) includes common atypical bacteria, i.e. nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), found in the environment which can infect people with HIV and low CD4 cell count (below 100/microliter); mode of infection is usually inhalation or ingestion. \\n\\nMAC causes disseminated disease in up to 40% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, producing fever, sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Disseminated MAC (DMAC) characteristically affects people with advanced HIV disease and peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 50 cells/uL. Effective prevention and therapy of MAC has the potential to contribute substantially to improved quality of life and duration of survival for HIV-infected persons. \\n\\nMycobacterium avium complex is the most commonly found form of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. \\n\\nImmunodeficiency is not a requirement for MAI. \\n\\nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) usually affects patients with abnormal lungs or bronchi. However, Jerome Reich and Richard Johnson describe a series of six patients with MAC infection of the right middle lobe or lingula who did not have any predisposing lung disorders. \\n\\nThe right middle lobe and lingula of the lungs are served by bronchi that are oriented downward when a person is in the upright position. As a result, these areas of the lung may be more dependent upon vigorous voluntary expectoration (cough) for clearance of bacteria and secretions. \\n\\nSince the six patients in their retrospective case series were older females, Reich and Johnson proposed that patients without a vigorous cough may develop right middle lobe or left lingular infection with MAC. They proposed this syndrome be named Lady Windermere syndrome, after the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde\\'s play Lady Windermere\\'s Fan. However, little research has confirmed this speculative cause. \\n\\nDiagnosis can be achieved through blood cultures or cultures of other bodily fluids such as sputum. Bone marrow culture can often yield an earlier diagnosis but is usually avoided as an initial diagnostic step because of its invasiveness. \\n\\nMany people will have anemia and neutropenia if the bone marrow is involved. MAC bacteria should always be considered in a person with HIV infection presenting with diarrhea. \\n\\nThe diagnosis requires consistent symptoms with two additional signs: \\n\\nChest X-ray or CT scan showing evidence of right middle lobe (or left lingular lobe) lung infection \\n\\nSputum culture or bronchoalveolar lavage culture demonstrating the infection is caused by MAC \\n\\nDisseminated MAC is most readily diagnosed by one positive blood culture. Blood cultures should be performed in patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities compatible with mycobacterium infection. Blood cultures are not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons, even for those who have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL. \\n\\nMAC in patients with HIV disease is theorized to represent recent acquisition rather than latent infection reactivating (which is the case in many other opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients). \\n\\nThe risk of MAC is inversely related to the patient\\'s CD4 count and increases significantly when the CD4 count decreases below 50 cells/mm³. Other risk factors for acquisition of MAC infection include using an indoor swimming pool, consumption of raw or partially cooked fish or shellfish, bronchoscopy and treatment with granulocyte stimulating factor. \\n\\nDisseminated disease was previously the common presentation prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Today, in regions where HAART is the standard of care, localized disease presentation is more likely. This generally includes a focal lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis. \\n\\nPeople with AIDS are given macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin for prophylactic treatment. \\n\\nPeople with HIV infection and less than 50 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/uL should be administered prophylaxis against MAC. Prophylaxis should be continued for the patient\\'s lifetime unless multiple drug therapy for MAC becomes necessary because of the development of MAC disease. \\n\\nClinicians must weigh the potential benefits of MAC prophylaxis against the potential for toxicities and drug interactions, the cost, the potential to produce resistance in a community with a high rate of tuberculosis, and the possibility that the addition of another drug to the medical regimen may adversely affect patients\\' compliance with treatment. Because of these concerns, therefore, in some situations rifabutin prophylaxis should not be administered. \\n\\nBefore prophylaxis is administered, patients should be assessed to ensure that they do not have the active disease due to MAC, M. tuberculosis, or any other mycobacterial species. This assessment may include a chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test. \\n\\nRifabutin, by mouth daily, is recommended for the people\\'s lifetime unless disseminated MAC develops, which would then require multiple drug therapy. Although other drugs, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, have laboratory and clinical activity against MAC, none has been shown in a prospective, controlled trial to be effective and safe for prophylaxis. Thus, in the absence of data, no other regimen can be recommended at this time. The 300-mg dose of rifabutin has been well tolerated. Adverse effects included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash, and gastrointestinal disturbances. \\n\\nPostinfection treatment involves a combination of antituberculosis antibiotics, including rifampicin, rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ethambutol, streptomycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin. \\n\\nNTM infections are usually treated with a three-drug regimen of either clarithromycin or azithromycin, plus rifampicin and ethambutol. Treatment typically lasts at least 12 months. \\n\\nAlthough studies have not yet identified an optimal regimen or confirmed that any therapeutic regimen produces sustained clinical benefit for patients with disseminated MAC, the Task Force concluded that the available information indicated the need for treatment of disseminated MAC. The Public Health Service, therefore, recommends that regimens be based on the following principles: \\n\\nTreatment regimens outside a clinical trial should include at least two agents. \\n\\nEvery regimen should contain either azithromycin or clarithromycin; many experts prefer ethambutol as a second drug. Many clinicians have added one or more of the following as second, third, or fourth agents: clofazimine, rifabutin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and in some situations amikacin. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide are not effective for the therapy of MAC. \\n\\nTherapy should continue for the lifetime of the patient if the clinical and microbiologic improvement is observed. \\n\\nClinical manifestations of disseminated MAC—such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats—should be monitored several times during the initial weeks of therapy. The microbiologic response, as assessed by blood culture every 4 weeks during initial therapy, can also be helpful in interpreting the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen. Most patients who ultimately respond show substantial clinical improvement in the first 4–6 weeks of therapy. Elimination of the organism from blood cultures may take somewhat longer, often requiring 4–12 weeks. \\n\\nHIV-infected children less than 12 years of age also develop disseminated MAC. Some age adjustment is necessary when clinicians interpret CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in children less than 2 years of age. Diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis should follow recommendations similar to those for adolescents and adults. \\n\\n\" Lady Windermere syndrome \" is one term to describe infection in the lungs due to MAC. It is named after a character in Oscar Wilde\\'s play Lady Windermere\\'s Fan. \\n\\nIn recent years, some have described the eponym as inappropriate, and some have noted that it would have been unlikely that Lady Windermere had the condition to which her name was assigned. \\n\\nThe more commonly used term is nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (NMI). There is no evidence that a person\\'s reluctance to spit has any causal role in NTM infection, the chief reason for the term having been applied to older women presenting with the condition. \\n\\nLady Windermere syndrome is a type of mycobacterial lung infection. \\n\\nThe original Chest article proposing the existence and pathophysiology of the Lady Windermere syndrome suggested the character Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde\\'s Victorian-era play Lady Windermere\\'s Fan is a good example of the fastidious behavior believed to cause the syndrome. The article states: \\n\\n: We offer the term, Lady Windermere\\'s Syndrome, from the Victorian-era play, Lady Windermere\\'s Fan, to convey the fastidious behavior hypothesized: \" How do you do, Lord Darlington. No, I can\\'t shake hands with you. My hands are all wet with the roses. \" \\n\\nVictorian women presumably believed \" ladies don\\'t spit, \" and consequently might have been predisposed to develop lung infection. \\n\\nShortly after the Lady Windermere syndrome was proposed, a librarian wrote a letter to the editor of Chest challenging the use of Lady Windermere as the eponymous ancestor of the proposed syndrome. In the play, Lady Windermere is a vivacious young woman, married only two years, who never coughs or displays any other signs of illness. While her avoidance of shaking hands might be interpreted as \" fastidiousness \" , two alternative explanations may be just as probable: \\n\\n:1) Lady Windermere actually is in the midst of arranging flowers and consequently cannot properly greet her guest: \\n\\n::[LADY WINDERMERE is at table R., arranging roses in a blue bowl.] \\n\\n:2) Lady Windermere wishes to discourage the flirtatious advances of her would-be suitor Lord Darlington and cites her wet hands as an excuse to keep him from touching her: \\n\\n::LADY WINDERMERE. Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office. I am afraid you are going to annoy me again. . . . \\n\\n::LORD DARLINGTON. [Takes chair and goes across L.C.] I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere. You must tell me what I did. [Sits down at table L.] \\n\\n::LADY WINDERMERE. Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.] \\n\\nThe scholars highlight the literary malapropism, but some in the medical community have adopted the term regardless, and peer-reviewed medical journals still sometimes mention the Lady Windermere syndrome, although it is increasingly viewed as a limiting and sexist term for a serious bacterial infection. \\n\\nParatuberculosis \\n\\n',\n",

The noise may be frightening, typically occurs only occasionally, and is not a serious health concern. \\n\\nThe cause is unknown. Potential explanations include ear problems, temporal lobe seizure, nerve dysfunction, or specific genetic changes. \\n\\nThere is no high quality evidence to support treatment. \\n\\nIndividuals with exploding head syndrome hear or experience loud imagined noises as they are falling asleep or waking up, have a strong, often frightened emotional reaction to the sound, and do not report significant pain; around 10% of people also experience visual disturbances like perceiving visual static, lightning, or flashes of light. Some people may also experience heat, strange feelings in their torso, or a feeling of electrical tinglings that ascends to the head before the auditory hallucinations occur. \\n\\nThe pattern of the auditory hallucinations is variable. Some people report having a total of two or four attacks followed by a prolonged or total remission, having attacks over the course of a few weeks or months before the attacks spontaneously disappear, or the attacks may even recur irregularly every few days, weeks, or months for much of a lifetime. \\n\\nSome individuals mistakenly believe that EHS episodes are not natural events, but are the effects of directed energy weapons which create an auditory effect. Thus, EHS has been worked into conspiracy theories, but there is no scientific evidence that EHS has non-natural origins. \\n\\nThe cause of EHS is unknown. \\n\\nOther theories into causes of EHS include: \\n\\nMinor seizures affecting the temporal lobe \\n\\nEar dysfunctions, including sudden shifts in middle ear components or the Eustachian tube, or a rupture of the membranous labyrinth or labyrinthine fistula \\n\\nStress and anxiety \\n\\nVariable and broken sleep, associated with a decline in delta sleep \\n\\nAntidepressant discontinuation syndrome \\n\\nTemporary calcium channel dysfunction. \\n\\nPTSD \\n\\nExploding head syndrome is classified under other parasomnias by the 2014 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd.Ed.) and is an unusual type of auditory hallucination in that it occurs in people who are not fully awake. \\n\\nAccording to ICD-10 and DSM-5 EHS is classified as either another specified sleep-wake disorder (codes:780.59 or G47.8) or unspecified sleep-wake disorder (codes: 780.59 or G47.9). \\n\\n, no clinical trials had been conducted to determine what treatments are safe and effective; a few case reports had been published describing treatment of small numbers of people (two to twelve per report) with clomipramine, flunarizine, nifedipine, topiramate, carbamazepine. \\n\\nThere have not been sufficient studies to make conclusive statements about how common or who is most often affected. \\n\\nCase reports of EHS have been published since at least 1876, which Silas Weir Mitchell described as \" sensory discharges \" in a patient. However, it has been suggested that the earliest written account of EHS was described in the biography of the French philosopher René Descartes in 1691. The phrase \" snapping of the brain \" was coined in 1920 by the British physician and psychiatrist Robert Armstrong-Jones. More recently, Peter Goadsby and Brian Sharpless have proposed renaming EHS \" episodic cranial sensory shock \" as it describes the symptoms more accurately (including the non-auditory elements) and better attributes to Mitchell. \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth: this allows a portion of oxygenated blood from the left heart to flow back to the lungs by flowing from the aorta, which has a higher pressure, to the pulmonary artery. Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased work of breathing and failure to gain weight at a normal rate. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right-sided heart failure. \\n\\nThe ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that normally closes soon after birth. In a PDA, the vessel does not close, but remains patent (open), resulting in an abnormal transmission of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. PDA is common in newborns with persistent respiratory problems such as hypoxia, and has a high occurrence in premature newborns. Premature newborns are more likely to be hypoxic and have PDA due to underdevelopment of the heart and lungs. \\n\\nIf transposition of the great vessels is present in addition to a PDA, the PDA is not surgically closed since it is the only way that oxygenated blood can mix with deoxygenated blood. In these cases, prostaglandins are used to keep the PDA open, and NSAID s are not administered until surgical correction of the two defects is completed. \\n\\nCommon symptoms include: \\n\\ndyspnea (shortness of breath) \\n\\nDiarrhea (fecal matter in their pants) \\n\\nSigns include: \\n\\ntachycardia (a heart rate exceeding the normal resting rate) \\n\\ncontinuous \" machine-like \" (also described as \" rolling-thunder \" and \" to-and-fro \" ) heart murmur (usually from aorta to pulmonary artery, with higher flow during systole and lower flow during diastole) \\n\\ncardiomegaly (enlarged heart, reflecting ventricular dilation and volume overload) \\n\\nleft subclavicular thrill \\n\\nbounding pulse \\n\\nwidened pulse pressure \\n\\nincreased cardiac output \\n\\nincreased systolic pressure \\n\\npoor growth \\n\\ndifferential cyanosis, i.e. cyanosis of the lower extremities but not of the upper body. \\n\\nPatients typically present in good health, with normal respirations and heart rate. If the PDA is moderate or large, widened pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses are frequently present, reflecting increased left ventricular stroke volume and diastolic run-off of blood into the (initially lower-resistance) pulmonary vascular bed. Prominent suprasternal and carotid pulsations may be noted secondary to increased left ventricular stroke volume. \\n\\nKnown risk factors include: \\n\\nPreterm birth \\n\\nCongenital rubella syndrome \\n\\nChromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome) \\n\\nGenetic conditions such as Loeys–Dietz syndrome (would also present with other heart defects), Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome, and CHARGE syndrome. \\n\\nPDA is usually diagnosed using noninvasive techniques. Echocardiography (in which sound waves are used to capture the motion of the heart) and associated Doppler studies are the primary methods of detecting PDA. Electrocardiography (ECG), in which electrodes are used to record the electrical activity of the heart, is not particularly helpful as no specific rhythms or ECG patterns can be used to detect PDA. \\n\\nA chest X-ray may be taken, which reveals overall heart size (as a reflection of the combined mass of the cardiac chambers) and the appearance of blood flow to the lungs. A small PDA most often accompanies a normal-sized heart and normal blood flow to the lungs. A large PDA generally accompanies an enlarged cardiac silhouette and increased blood flow to the lungs. \\n\\nFile:Blausen 0707 PatentDuctusArteriosus.png|Illustration of Patent Ductus Arteriosus \\n\\nImage:Heart patent ductus arteriosus.jpg|Patent ductus arteriosus \\n\\nFile:Stent tekst.jpg|An echocardiogram of a stented persisting ductus arteriosus: One can see the aortic arch and the stent leaving.

Indomethacin treatment in premature infants also may reduce the need for surgical intervention. \\n\\nNeonates without adverse symptoms may simply be monitored as outpatients, while symptomatic PDA can be treated with both surgical and non-surgical methods. Surgically, the DA may be closed by ligation (though support in premature infants is mixed), either manually tied shut, or with intravascular coils or plugs that leads to formation of a thrombus in the DA. \\n\\nDevices developed by Franz Freudenthal block the blood vessel with woven structures of nitinol wire. \\n\\nBecause prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the DA open, NSAID Recent findings from a systematic review concluded that, for closure of a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin. It also causes fewer side effects (such as transient acute kidney injury) and reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. A review and meta-analysis showed that paracetamol may be effective for closure of a PDA in preterm infants. A recent network meta-analysis that compared indomethacin, paracetamol and ibuprofen at different doses and administration schemes among them found that a high dose of oral ibuprofen may offer the highest likelihood of closure in preterm infants. \\n\\nWhile indomethacin can be used to close a PDA, some neonates require their PDA be kept open. Keeping a ductus arteriosus patent is indicated in neonates born with concurrent heart malformations, such as transposition of the great arteries. Drugs such as alprostadil, a PGE-1 analog, can be used to keep a PDA open until the primary defect is corrected surgically. \\n\\nIf left untreated, the disease may progress from left-to-right shunt (acyanotic heart) to right-to-left shunt (cyanotic heart), called Eisenmenger\\'s syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension is a potential long-term outcome, which may require a heart and/or lung transplant. Another complication of PDA is intraventricular hemorrhage. \\n\\nRobert E. Gross, MD performed the first successful ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus on a seven-year-old girl at Children\\'s Hospital Boston in 1938. \\n\\nSince PDA is usually identified in infants, it is less common in adults, but it can have serious consequences, and is usually corrected surgically upon diagnosis. \\n\\nGeorge Alexander Gibson \\n\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus Causes from US Department of Health and Human Services \\n\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus from Merck \\n\\nPatent ductus arteriosus information for parents.',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Deep vein thrombosis',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. Complications can include pulmonary embolism, as a result of detachment of a clot, which travels to the lungs, and post-thrombotic syndrome. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). \\n\\nThe mechanism of clot formation typically involves some combination of decreased blood flow rate, increased tendency to clot, and injury to the blood vessel wall. \\n\\nIndividuals suspected of having DVT can be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test can also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing. \\n\\nAnticoagulation (blood thinners) is the standard treatment. The rate of DVTs increases from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about one in 1000 adults are affected per year. About 5% of people are affected by a VTE at some point in time. \\n\\nSigns and symptoms of DVT, while highly variable, include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, dilation of surface veins, redness or discoloration, and cyanosis with fever. and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, ruptured Baker\\'s cyst, musculoskeletal injury and hematoma, lymphedema, and chronic venous insufficiency. Other differential diagnoses include tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders. \\n\\nThe disease term venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). The three factors of Virchow\\'s triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and changes in the endothelial blood vessel lining (such as physical damage or endothelial activation)—contribute to VTE and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. \\n\\nAcquired risk factors include the strong risk factor of older age, Previous VTE, particularly unprovoked VTE, is a strong risk factor. paralysis, sitting, long-haul travel, bed rest, hospitalization, and in survivors of acute stroke. Conditions that involve compromised blood flow in the veins are May–Thurner syndrome, where a vein of the pelvis is compressed, and venous thoracic outlet syndrome, which includes Paget–Schroetter syndrome, where compression occurs near the base of the neck. \\n\\nCancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Cancers of the bone, ovary, brain, pancreas, and lymphomas are especially associated with increased VTE risk. \\n\\nFamily history of VTE is a risk factor for a first VTE. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, mildly increases VTE risk by about three times. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting. \\n\\nInflammatory diseases such as Behçet\\'s syndrome, and some autoimmune diseases, such as primary antiphospholipid syndrome increase risk. Other associated conditions include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic storm, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, nephrotic syndrome, infection, are associated with increased risk. \\n\\nSome risk factors influence the location of DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age do not seem to increase risk. Common risk factors for having an upper extremity DVT include having an existing foreign body (such as a central venous catheter, a pacemaker, or a triple-lumen PICC line), cancer, and recent surgery. \\n\\nDVT often develops in the calf veins and \" grows \" in the direction of venous flow, towards the heart. When DVT does not grow, it can be cleared naturally and dissolved into the blood (fibrinolysis). Veins in the leg or pelvis are most commonly affected, including the popliteal vein (behind the knee), femoral vein (of the thigh), and iliac veins of the pelvis. Extensive lower-extremity DVT can even reach into the or the inferior vena cava (in the abdomen). \\n\\nThe causes of arterial thrombosis, such as with heart attacks, are more clearly understood than those of venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, \\n\\nOften, DVT begins in the valves of veins. \\n\\nDVT diagnosis requires the use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis. \\n\\nProvoked DVTs occur in association with acquired risk factors, such as surgery, oral contraceptives, trauma, immobility, obesity, or cancer; cases without acquired states are called unprovoked or idiopathic. Acute DVT is characterized by pain and swelling and is usually occlusive, The label \" chronic \" has been applied to symptomatic DVT that persists longer than 10 to 14 days. DVT that has no symptoms, but is found only by screening, is labeled asymptomatic or incidental. An initial episode of DVT is called incident and any subsequent DVT is termed recurrent. Bilateral DVT refers to clots in both legs while unilateral means that only a single leg is affected. \\n\\nDVT in the legs is proximal when above the knee and distal (or calf) when below the knee. DVT below the popliteal vein, a proximal vein behind the knee, is classified as distal and has limited clinical significance compared to proximal DVT. Iliofemoral DVT involves at a minimum the common iliac vein (see lower left image). Upper extremity DVT occurs in the arms or the base of the neck. Phlegmasia alba dolens and phlegmasia cerulea dolens occur when a DVT is very large and causes significant obstruction of the veins (complete or near-complete occlusion). In the former, the affected leg is white and painful as the congestion is so severe that the arterial blood supply is reduced. In the latter, the arterial supply is reduced to the point that there is a blue tinge and venous gangrene can develop, generally with severe pain. Surgery might be required in this setting. \\n\\nFile:Gray586.png|The iliac veins (in the pelvis) include the external iliac vein, the internal iliac vein, and the common iliac vein \\n\\nFile:2134 Thoracic Upper Limb Veins.jpg|Upper extremity DVTs can occur in the subclavian, axillary, brachial, ulnar, and radial veins (pictured) and the jugular and brachiocephalic veins (not pictured). The cephalic and basilic veins, however, are superficial veins. \\n\\nIn those with suspected DVT, a clinical assessment of probability can be useful to determine which tests to perform. The most studied clinical prediction rule is the Wells score. \\n\\nWells score or criteria: (possible score −2 to 9) \\n\\n#Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative): +1 point \\n\\n#Calf swelling ≥ 3 cm compared to asymptomatic calf (measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity): +1 point \\n\\n#Swollen unilateral superficial veins (non-varicose, in symptomatic leg): +1 point \\n\\n#Unilateral pitting edema (in symptomatic leg): +1 point \\n\\n#Previous documented DVT: +1 point \\n\\n#Swelling of entire leg: +1 point \\n\\n#Localized tenderness along the deep venous system: +1 point \\n\\n#Paralysis, paresis, or recent cast immobilization of lower extremities: +1 point \\n\\n#Recently bedridden ≥ 3 days, or major surgery requiring regional or general anesthetic in the past 12 weeks: +1 point \\n\\n#Alternative diagnosis at least as likely: −2 points \\n\\nThose with Wells scores of two or more have a 28% chance of having DVT, those with a lower score have 6% probability. Alternatively, Wells scores can be categorized as high if greater than two, moderate if one or two, and low if less than one, with likelihoods of 53%, 17%, and 5%, respectively. \\n\\nD-dimers are a fibrin degradation product, and an elevated level can result from plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. \\n\\nFor a suspected first leg DVT in a low-probability situation, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends testing either D-dimer levels with moderate or high sensitivity or compression ultrasound of the proximal veins. These options are suggested over whole-leg ultrasound, and D-dimer testing is the suggested preference overall. \\n\\nFor a suspected first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is suggested as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible. The NICE guideline uses a two-point Wells score and does not refer to a moderate probability group. \\n\\nImaging tests of the veins are used in the diagnosis of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan might miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. \\n\\nUltrasonography for suspected deep vein thrombosis has a sensitivity of 97% in detecting DVTs of the proximal legs. \\n\\nThe gold standard for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed. \\n\\nDVTUS.PNG|An ultrasound with a blood clot visible in the left common femoral vein.

Walking and leg exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. Excess body weight is another risk factor that can be modified, and as such, interventions and lifestyle modifications that help someone lose weight work to reduce DVT risk. Depending upon the risk for DVT, different preventive measures can be recommended. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. \\n\\nAnticoagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding, is sometimes used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, For example, antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; and in those with a previous VTE. Following the completion of warfarin, long-term aspirin is useful to prevent re occurrence. we should be citing more recent secondary studies instead, commenting this out for now on 1 June 2020--> \\n\\nStatins have been investigated as a potential primary prevention measure to reduce VTE occurrence. The JUPITER trial, which used rosuvastatin, has provided some tentative evidence of effectiveness. Out of all the statins that have been studied, rosuvastatin appears to be the only one with the potential to reduce VTE risk. \\n\\nA 2014 Cochrane review found that using heparin in medical patients did not change the risk of death or pulmonary embolism. \\n\\nThe 2012 ACCP guidelines for nonsurgical patients recommend anticoagulation for the acutely ill in cases of elevated risk when neither bleeding nor a high risk of bleeding exists. Mechanical prophylaxis is suggested when risks for bleeding and thrombosis are elevated. For the critically ill, either pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis is suggested depending upon the risk. Heparin can also be used in outpatients with cancer who have solid tumors and additional risk factors for VTE—listed as \" previous venous thrombosis, immobilization, hormonal therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, thalidomide, and lenalidomide \" —and a low risk of bleeding. \\n\\nMajor orthopedic surgery—total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgery—has a high risk of causing VTE. If prophylaxis is not used after these surgeries, symptomatic VTE has about a 4% chance of developing within 35 days. Intermittent pneumatic compression is also an option. \\n\\nThe risk of VTE is increased in pregnancy by about five times because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventive treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP in 2012. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with a family history of VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy. \\n\\nSuggestions for at-risk long-haul travelers include calf exercises, frequent walking, and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking. Graduated compression stockings have sharply reduced the levels of asymptomatic DVT in airline passengers, but the effect on symptomatic DVT, PE, or mortality is unknown, as none of the individuals studied developed these outcomes. However, graduated compression stockings are not suggested for long-haul travelers (> 4 hours) without risk factors for VTE. Likewise, neither aspirin nor anticoagulants are suggested in the general population undertaking long-haul travel. \\n\\nAnticoagulation, which prevents further coagulation, but does not act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. Thrombophilia test results rarely play a role in the length of treatment. Two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which can be an effective and safe alternative to warfarin for acute DVT. \\n\\nFor acute cases in the leg, the ACCP recommended a parenteral anticoagulant (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) for at least five days and a VKA, the oral anticoagulant, the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age. \\n\\nThe ACCP recommended treatment for three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients should have at least three months of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, three months is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested for three months of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios. \\n\\nThe ACCP recommended initial home treatment instead of hospital treatment for those with acute leg DVT. This applies as long as individuals feel ready for it, and those with severe leg symptoms or comorbidities would not qualify. An appropriate home environment is expected: one that can provide a quick return to the hospital if necessary, support from family or friends, and phone access. \\n\\nUnless medical problems prevent movement, bed rest should not be used to treat acute DVT after beginning anticoagulation. , which cites \\n\\nNor are compression stockings likely to reduce VTE recurrence. \\n\\nInstead of anticoagulation, a follow-up imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis is an option for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective. \\n\\nThrombolysis is the injection of an enzyme into the veins to dissolve blood clots, and while this treatment has been proven effective against the life-threatening emergency clots of stroke and heart attacks, randomized controlled trials have not established a net benefit in those with acute proximal DVT. Drawbacks of catheter-directed thrombolysis (the preferred method of administering the clot-busting enzyme \\n\\nFile:PCD2016.jpg|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (literally: painful blue edema) is a particularly severe form of acute, proximal, and occlusive DVT.

Afterwards, a first rib resection provided thoracic outlet decompression to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and the risk of sequelae from thoracic outlet compression. \\n\\nInferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) are not recommended for those using the standard treatment for acute DVT, anticoagulation. In general, they are only recommended in some high-risk scenarios. \\n\\nA mechanical thrombectomy device can remove venous clots, although the ACCP considers it an option only when the following conditions apply: \" iliofemoral DVT, symptoms for Anticoagulation alone is suggested over thrombectomy. \\n\\nUntreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. Around 56% of those with proximal DVT have PE as well, although a chest CT is not needed simply because of the presence of a DVT. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. \\n\\nThe presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. VTE recurrence in those with prior DVT is more likely to recur as DVT than PE. Cancer and unprovoked DVT are strong risk factors for recurrence. In upper extremity DVT, annual VTE recurrence is about 2–4%. \\n\\nA seemingly unprovoked VTE might suggest the presence of an undiagnosed cancer, but it is not common practice to screen people with unprovoked VTE for the presence of cancer. Scanning individuals with a CT of the abdomen and pelvis in this scenario has not proven beneficial. \\n\\nAbout 1.5 out of 1000 adults a year have a first VTE in high-income countries. or in those who do significant amounts of overhead work, such as electricians and mechanics. \\n\\nDuring pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about 1.2 of 1000 deliveries. Despite it being relatively rare, it is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. After surgery with preventive treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 400,000 Americans develop an initial VTE each year, with 100,000 deaths or more attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites. \\n\\nIn North American and European populations, around 4–8% of people have a thrombophilia, Non-O blood type is present in around 50% of the general population and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE. \\n\\nBeing on blood thinners because of DVT can be life-changing for patients because it may prevent them from continuing lifestyle activities such as contact or winter sports to prevent bleeding episodes after potential injuries. Head injuries prompting brain bleeds are of particular concern. This has caused NASCAR driver Brian Vickers to forego participation in races. Professional basketball players including NBA players Chris Bosh and hall of famer Hakeem Olajuwon have dealt with recurrent blood clots, and Bosh\\'s career was significantly hampered by DVT and PE. Tennis star Serena Williams was hospitalized in 2011 for PE thought to have originated from a DVT. Due to her knowledge of DVT and PE, in 2017, after feeling the sudden onset of a PE symptom, Serena accurately advocated for herself to have PE diagnosed and treated. \\n\\nOther notable people have been affected by DVT. Former US President Richard Nixon had recurrent DVT, and so has former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She was first diagnosed while First Lady in 1998 and again in 2009. Dick Cheney was diagnosed with an episode while Vice President, and TV show host Regis Philbin had a DVT after hip-replacement surgery. DVT has also contributed to the deaths of famous people. For example, DVT and PE played a role in rapper Heavy D\\'s death. NBC journalist David Bloom died while covering the Iraq War from a PE that was thought to have progressed from a missed DVT. And actor Jimmy Stewart had a DVT that progressed to a fatal PE when he was 87. \\n\\nPatients with a history of DVT might be managed by primary care, general internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, vascular surgery, or vascular medicine. Patients suspected of having an acute DVT are often referred to the emergency department for evaluation. Interventional radiology is the specialty that typically places and retrieves IVC filters, and vascular surgery might do catheter directed thrombosis for some severe DVTs. \\n\\nThe earliest case of DVT was described by Sushruta in his book Sushruta Samhita around 600–900 BC. The next case was not described until 1271, in the leg of a 20-year-old male. At some point, the increased incidence of DVT in women after childbirth was noticed, and in the late 1700s, a public health recommendation was issued to encourage women to breastfeed as a means to prevent this phenomenon; the DVT was called \" milk leg \" , as it was thought to result from milk building up in the leg. \\n\\nIn 1856, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what is referred to as Virchow\\'s triad, the three major causes of thrombosis. \\n\\nMultiple pharmacological therapies for DVT were introduced in the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, subcutaneous injections of LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous injections of LMWH in 1982. For around 50 years, a months-long warfarin (Coumadin) regimen was the mainstay of pharmacological treatment after several days of using a subcutaneous heparin. To avoid the blood monitoring required with warfarin and the injections required by heparin and heparin-like medicines, a new generation of anticoagulant pills that can be taken by mouth and do not require blood monitoring has sought to replace these traditional anticoagulants. The New York Times described a \" furious battle \" among the three makers of these drugs \" for the prescription pads of doctors \" . \\n\\nDiagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s, but the use of Doppler ultrasound techniques, with their increased sensitivity and specificity, largely superseded this method. \\n\\nInitial DVT costs for an average hospitalized patient in the U.S. are around $7,700–$10,800. VTE follow-up costs at three months, six months, and a year are about $5,000, $10,000, and $33,000 respectively; in Europe, the three and six-month figures are about €1,800 and €3,200. Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. or in excess of $8 billion, and the average annual cost per treated individual is thought to be about $20,000. As an example, if 300,000 symptomatic DVT patients were treated at costs averaging $20,000 annually, that would cost $6 billion a year. \\n\\nA 2019 study published in Nature Genetics expanded the known genetic loci associated with VTE from 11 to 33. In their updated 2018 clinical practice guidelines, the American Society of Hematology identified 29 separate research priorities, most of which related to patients who are acutely or critically ill. \\n\\nThrombotic microangiopathy \\n\\nHELLP syndrome \\n\\n;Cited literature \\n\\nClinical prediction website – Wells score for deep vein thrombosis',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs arise in the smooth muscle pacemaker interstitial cell of Cajal, or similar cells. \\n\\nGIST was introduced as a diagnostic term in 1983. Until the late 1990s, many non-epithelial tumors of the gastrointestinal tract were called \" gastrointestinal stromal tumors \" . Histopathologists were unable to specifically distinguish between types we now know to be dissimilar molecularly. Subsequently, CD34, and later CD117 were identified as markers that could distinguish the various types. Additionally, in the absence of specific therapy, the diagnostic categorization had only a limited influence on prognosis and therapy. \\n\\nThe understanding of GIST biology changed significantly with identification of the molecular basis of GIST, \\n\\nDue to the change in definition, clinical pathways of care before the year 2000 are largely uninformative in the current era. \\n\\nGISTs may present with trouble swallowing, gastrointestinal bleeding, or metastases (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor\\'s outward pattern of growth. Often, there is a history of vague abdominal pain or discomfort, and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made. \\n\\nGISTs are tumors of connective tissue, i.e. sarcomas; unlike most gastrointestinal tumors, they are nonepithelial. About 70% occur in the stomach, 20% in the small intestine and less than 10% in the esophagus. Small tumors are generally benign, especially when cell division rate is slow, but large tumors disseminate to the liver, omentum and peritoneal cavity. They rarely occur in other abdominal organs. \\n\\nGISTs are thought to arise from interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), that are normally part of the autonomic nervous system of the intestine. They serve a pacemaker function in controlling motility. \\n\\nMost GISTs are sporadic. Less than 5% occur as part of hereditary familial or idiopathic multitumor syndromes. These include, in descending order of frequency, neurofibromatosis Recklinghausen (NF-1), Carney\\'s triad (gastric GIST, pulmonary chondroma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma), germline gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit/PDGFRA, and the Carney-Stratakis syndrome. \\n\\nApproximately 85% GISTs are associated with an abnormal c-KIT pathway. c-KIT is a gene that encodes for a transmembrane receptor for a growth factor termed stem cell factor (scf). The abnormal c-KIT pathway most commonly (85%) arises from mutation of the gene itself; a smaller subset of c-KIT-associated GISTs are associated with constitutive activity of the KIT enzymatic pathway, found by immunoblotting. The c-KIT product/CD117 is expressed on ICCs and a large number of other cells, mainly bone marrow cells, mast cells, melanocytes and several others. In the gut, however, a mass staining positive for CD117 is likely to be a GIST, arising from ICC cells. \\n\\nThe c-KIT molecule comprises a long extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular part. Mutations generally occur in the DNA encoding the intracellular part (exon 11), which acts as a tyrosine kinase to activate other enzymes. Mutations make c-KITfunction independent of activation by scf, leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Additional mutations are likely \" required \" for a cell with a c-KIT mutation to develop into a GIST, but the c-KIT mutation is probably the first step of this process. \\n\\nMutations in the exons 11, 9 and rarely 13 and 17 of the c-KIT gene are known to occur in GIST. The tyrosine kinase function of c-KIT is important in the medical therapy for GISTs, as described below. \\n\\nKIT-D816V point mutations in c-KIT exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. \\n\\nKIT-p.D419del (exon 8) - A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del). \\n\\nMost GIST cells with wildtype (i.e. not mutated) c-kit instead have a mutation in another gene, PDGFR-α (platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha), which is a related tyrosine kinase. Mutations in c-kit and PDGFrA are mutually exclusive . \\n\\nLesser numbers of GISTs appear to be associated with neither c-kit nor PDGFR-α abnormalities. \\n\\nCT scanning is often undertaken (see the radiology section). \\n\\nThe definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy, which can be obtained endoscopically, percutaneously with CT or ultrasound guidance or at the time of surgery. A biopsy sample will be investigated under the microscope by a pathologist physician. The pathologist examines the histopathology to identify the characteristics of GISTs (spindle cells in 70-80%, epitheloid aspect in 20-30%). Smaller tumors can usually be confined to the muscularis propria layer of the intestinal wall. Large ones grow, mainly outward, from the bowel wall until the point where they outstrip their blood supply and necrose (die) on the inside, forming a cavity that may eventually come to communicate with the bowel lumen. \\n\\nWhen GIST is suspected & mdash;as opposed to other causes for similar tumors & mdash;the pathologist can use immunohistochemistry (specific antibodies that stain the molecule CD117 [also known as c-kit] & mdash;see below). 95% of all GISTs are CD117-positive (other possible markers include CD34, DOG-1, desmin, and vimentin). Other cells that show CD117 positivity are mast cells. \\n\\nIf the CD117 stain is negative and suspicion remains that the tumor is a GIST, the newer antibody DOG-1 (Discovered On GIST-1) can be used. Also sequencing of Kit and PDGFRA can be used to prove the diagnosis. \\n\\nThe purpose of radiologic imaging is to locate the lesion, evaluate for signs of invasion and detect metastasis. Features of GIST vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. The diameter can range from a few millimeters to more than 30 cm. Larger tumors usually cause symptoms in contrast to those found incidentally which tend to be smaller and have better prognosis. \\n\\nPlain radiographs are not very helpful in the evaluation of GISTs. If an abnormality is seen, it will be an indirect sign due to the tumor mass effect on adjacent organs. On abdominal x-ray, stomach GISTs may appear as a radiopaque mass altering the shape of the gastric air shadow. Intestinal GISTs may displace loops of bowel and larger tumors may obstruct the bowel and films will show an obstructive pattern. If cavitations are present, plain radiographs will show collections of air within the tumor. Calcification is an unusual feature of GIST but if present can be visible on plain films. \\n\\nBarium fluoroscopic examinations and CT are commonly used to evaluate the patient with abdominal complaints. Barium swallow images show abnormalities in 80% of GIST cases. Among imaging studies, MRI has the best tissue contrast, which aids in the identification of masses within the GI tract (intramural masses). Intravenous contrast material is needed to evaluate lesion vascularity. \\n\\nPreferred imaging modalities in the evaluation of GISTs are CT and MRI, \\n\\nSince GISTs arise from the bowel layer called muscularis propria (which is deeper to the mucosa and submucosa from a luminal perspective), small GIST imaging usually suggest a submucosal process or a mass within the bowel wall. In barium swallow studies, these GISTs most commonly present with smooth borders forming right or obtuse angles with the nearby bowel wall, as seen with any other intramural mass. The mucosal surface is usually intact except for areas of ulceration, which are generally present in 50% of GISTs. Ulcerations fill with barium causing a bull\\'s eye or target lesion appearance. In contrast-enhanced CT, small GISTs are seen as smooth, sharply defined intramural masses with homogeneous attenuation. \\n\\nAs the tumor grows it may project outside the bowel (exophytic growth) and/or inside the bowel (intraluminal growth), but they most commonly grow exophytically such that the bulk of the tumor projects into the abdominal cavity. If the tumor outstrips its blood supply, it can necrose internally, creating a central fluid-filled cavity with bleeding and cavitations that can eventually ulcerate and communicate into the lumen of the bowel. In that case, barium swallow may show an air, air-fluid levels or oral contrast media accumulation within these areas. \\n\\nMalignancy is characterized by local invasion and metastases, usually to the liver, omentum and peritoneum. However, cases of metastases to bone, pleura, lungs and retroperitoneum have been seen. In distinction to gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric/small bowel lymphoma, malignant lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is uncommon ( & lt;10%) and thus imaging usually shows absence of lymph node enlargement. Also, overtly malignant behavior (in distinction to malignant potential of lesser degree) is less commonly seen in gastric tumors, with a ratio of behaviorally benign to overtly malignant of 3-5:1. Even if radiographic malignant features are present, these findings may also represent other tumors and definitive diagnosis must be made immunochemically. \\n\\nLocalized, resectable adult GISTs, if anatomically and physiologically feasible, surgery is the primary treatment of choice. \\n\\nRadiotherapy has not historically been effective for GISTs However, three medications have been identified for clinical benefit in GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. \\n\\nImatinib (Glivec/Gleevec), an orally administered drug initially marketed for chronic myelogenous leukemia based on bcr-abl inhibition, also inhibits both c-kit tyrosine kinase mutations and PDGFRA mutations other than D842V, is useful in treating GISTs in several situations. Imatinib has been used in selected neoadjuvant settings. An exception to this is where the anatomical position of the tumour means that surgery is technically difficult or complex. For example, rectal GIST often requires radical surgery to achieve complete resection, involving abdominoperineal resection and permanent stoma. In these situations, the use of neoadjuvant imatinib can significantly decrease both tumour size and mitotic activity, and permit less radical sphincter-preserving surgery. \\n\\nA substantial proportion of GIST tumors have a high risk of recurrence as estimated by a number of validated risk stratification schemes, and can be considered for adjuvant therapy. \\n\\nImatinib was approved for metastatic and unresectable GIST by the US FDA, February 1, 2002. The two-year survival of patients with advanced disease has risen to 75–80% following imatinib treatment. \\n\\nIf resistance to imatinib is encountered, the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (marketed as Sutent) can be considered. \\n\\nThe effectiveness of imatinib and sunitinib depend on the genotype. \\n\\nRegorafenib (Stivarga) was FDA approved in 2013 for advanced GISTs that cannot be surgically removed and that no longer respond to imatinib (Gleevec) and sunitinib (Sutent). \\n\\nGISTs occur in 10-20 per one million people. The true incidence might be higher, as novel laboratory methods are much more sensitive in diagnosing GISTs. The estimated incidence of GIST in the United States is approximately 5000 cases annually. This makes GIST the most common form of sarcoma, which constitutes more than 70 types of cancer. \\n\\nThe majority of GISTs present at ages 50–70 years. Across most of the age spectrum, the incidence of GIST is similar in men and women. \\n\\nAdult GISTs are rare before age 40. Pediatric GISTs are considered to be biologically distinct. \\n\\nGIST Support U.K. \\n\\nSurgery Questions in GIST ESUN (August 15, 2006) \\n\\nSPAEN (Sarcoma Patients EuroNet) - European Network of Sarcoma, GIST and Desmoid Patient Advocacy Groups \\n\\nGIST Support International \\n\\nLife Raft Group International GIST Advocacy Organization \\n\\n& dt=81 American Cancer Society Patient Guide to GIST tumors. \\n\\nCancer.Net: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': \"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a syndrome, characterized by inflammation in different organs, with the specificity of epithelial cell apoptosis and crypt drop out. GvHD is commonly associated with stem cell transplants such as those that occur with bone marrow transplants. GvHD also applies to other forms of transplanted tissues such as solid organ transplants. \\n\\nWhite blood cells of the donor's immune system which remain within the donated tissue (the graft) recognize the recipient (the host) as foreign (non-self). The white blood cells present within the transplanted tissue then attack the recipient's body's cells, which leads to GvHD. This should not be confused with a transplant rejection, which occurs when the immune system of the transplant recipient rejects the transplanted tissue; GvHD occurs when the donor's immune system's white blood cells reject the recipient. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but the details and course may differ. GvHD can also occur after a blood transfusion if the blood products used have not been irradiated or treated with an approved pathogen reduction system. \\n\\nIn the classical sense, acute graft-versus-host-disease is characterized by selective damage to the liver, skin (rash), mucosa, and the gastrointestinal tract. Newer research indicates that other graft-versus-host-disease target organs include the immune system (the hematopoietic system, e.g., the bone marrow and the thymus) itself, and the lungs in the form of immune-mediated pneumonitis . Biomarkers can be used to identify specific causes of GvHD, such as elafin in the skin. Chronic graft-versus-host-disease also attacks the above organs, but over its long-term course can also cause damage to the connective tissue and exocrine glands . \\n\\nAcute GvHD of the GI tract can result in severe intestinal inflammation, sloughing of the mucosal membrane, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting . This is typically diagnosed via intestinal biopsy. Liver GvHD is measured by the bilirubin level in acute patients . Skin GvHD results in a diffuse red maculopapular rash , sometimes in a lacy pattern. \\n\\nMucosal damage to the vagina can result in severe pain and scarring, and appears in both acute and chronic GvHD. This can result in an inability to have sexual intercourse. \\n\\nAcute GvHD is staged as follows: overall grade (skin-liver-gut) with each organ staged individually from a low of 1 to a high of 4. Patients with grade IV GvHD usually have a poor prognosis. If the GvHD is severe and requires intense immunosuppression involving steroids and additional agents to get under control, the patient may develop severe infections as a result of the immunosuppression and may die of infection. However, a 2016 study found that the prognosis for patients with grade IV GvHD has improved in recent years . \\n\\nIn the oral cavity, chronic graft-versus-host-disease manifests as lichen planus with a higher risk of malignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma in comparison to the classical oral lichen planus. Graft-versus-host-disease-associated oral cancer may have more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis, when compared to oral cancer in non-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. \\n\\nIn the clinical setting, graft-versus-host-disease is divided into acute and chronic forms, and scored or graded on the basis of the tissue affected and the severity of the reaction. \\n\\nThe acute or fulminant form of the disease (aGvHD) is normally observed within the first 100 days post-transplant, and is a major challenge to transplants owing to associated morbidity and mortality. \\n\\nThe chronic form of graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) normally occurs after 100 days. The appearance of moderate to severe cases of cGVHD adversely influences long-term survival. \\n\\nThree criteria, known as the Billingham criteria, must be met in order for GvHD to occur. \\n\\nAn immuno-competent graft is administered, with viable and functional immune cells. \\n\\nThe recipient is immunologically different from the donor – histo-incompatible. \\n\\nThe recipient is immunocompromised and therefore cannot destroy or inactivate the transplanted cells. \\n\\nAfter bone marrow transplantation, T cells present in the graft, either as contaminants or intentionally introduced into the host, attack the tissues of the transplant recipient after perceiving host tissues as antigenically foreign. The T cells produce an excess of cytokines, including TNF-α and interferon-gamma (IFNγ). A wide range of host antigens can initiate graft-versus-host-disease, among them the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) . However, graft-versus-host disease can occur even when HLA-identical siblings are the donors . HLA-identical siblings or HLA-identical unrelated donors often have genetically different proteins (called minor histocompatibility antigens) that can be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to the donor's T-cells, which see these antigens as foreign and so mount an immune response. \\n\\nAntigens most responsible for graft loss are HLA-DR (first six months), HLA-B (first two years), and HLA-A (long-term survival). \\n\\nWhile donor T-cells are undesirable as effector cells of graft-versus-host-disease, they are valuable for engraftment by preventing the recipient's residual immune system from rejecting the bone marrow graft (host-versus-graft). In addition, as bone marrow transplantation is frequently used to treat cancer, mainly leukemias, donor T-cells have proven to have a valuable graft-versus-tumor effect . A great deal of current research on allogeneic bone marrow transplantation involves attempts to separate the undesirable graft-vs-host-disease aspects of T-cell physiology from the desirable graft-versus-tumor effect . \\n\\nThis type of GvHD is associated with transfusion of un-irradiated blood to immunocompromised recipients. It can also occur in situations in which the blood donor is homozygous and the recipient is heterozygous for an HLA haplotype. It is associated with higher mortality (80–90%) due to involvement of bone marrow lymphoid tissue, however the clinical manifestations are similar to GVHD resulting from bone marrow transplantation. Transfusion-associated GvHD is rare in modern medicine. It is almost entirely preventable by controlled irradiation of blood products to inactivate the white blood cells (including lymphocytes) within. \\n\\nThymus transplantation may be said to be able to cause a special type of GvHD because the recipient's thymocytes would use the donor thymus cells as models when going through the negative selection to recognize self-antigens, and could therefore still mistake own structures in the rest of the body for being non-self. This is a rather indirect GvHD because it is not directly cells in the graft itself that causes it but cells in the graft that make the recipient's T cells act like donor T cells. It can be seen as a multiple-organ autoimmunity in xenotransplantation experiments of the thymus between different species. Autoimmune disease is a frequent complication after human allogeneic thymus transplantation, found in 42% of subjects over 1 year post transplantation. However, this is partially explained by the fact that the indication itself, that is, complete DiGeorge syndrome, increases the risk of autoimmune disease. \\n\\nA GvHD-like disease called thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity (TAMA) can occur in patients with thymoma. In these patients rather than a donor being a source of pathogenic T cells, the patient's own malignant thymus produces self-directed T cells. This is because the malignant thymus is incapable of appropriately educating developing thymocytes to eliminate self-reactive T cells. The end result is a disease virtually indistinguishable from GvHD. \\n\\nThe pathophysiology of GvHD includes three phases: \\n\\nThe afferent phase: activation of APC (antigen presenting cells) \\n\\nThe efferent phase: activation, proliferation, differentiation and migration of effector cells \\n\\nThe effector phase: target tissue destruction \\n\\nActivation of APC occurs in the first stage of GvHD. Prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, radiation or chemotherapy results in damage and activation of host tissues, especially intestinal mucosa. This allows the microbial products to enter and stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α. These proinflammatory cytokines increase the expression of MHC and adhesion molecules on APCs, thereby increasing the ability of APC to present antigen. \\n\\nThe second phase is characterized by the activation of effector cells. Activation of donor T-cells further enhances the expression of MHC and adhesion molecules, chemokines and the expansion of CD8 + and CD4 + T-cells and guest B-cells. In the final phase, these effector cells migrate to target organs and mediate tissue damage, resulting in multiorgan failure. \\n\\nDNA-based tissue typing allows for more precise HLA matching between donors and transplant patients, which has been proven to reduce the incidence and severity of GvHD and to increase long-term survival. \\n\\nThe T-cells of umbilical cord blood (UCB) have an inherent immunological immaturity, and the use of UCB stem cells in unrelated donor transplants has a reduced incidence and severity of GvHD. \\n\\nMethotrexate, cyclosporin and tacrolimus are common drugs used for GvHD prophylaxis . \\n\\nGraft-versus-host-disease can largely be avoided by performing a T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplant. However, these types of transplants come at a cost of diminished graft-versus-tumor effect, greater risk of engraftment failure, or cancer relapse, and general immunodeficiency, resulting in a patient more susceptible to viral, bacterial, and fungal infection. In a multi-center study, disease-free survival at 3 years was not different between T cell-depleted and T cell-replete transplants. \\n\\nIntravenously administered glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, are the standard of care in acute GvHD and chronic GVHD. The use of these glucocorticoids is designed to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune onslaught on the host tissues; however, in high doses, this immune-suppression raises the risk of infections and cancer relapse. Therefore, it is desirable to taper off the post-transplant high-level steroid doses to lower levels, at which point the appearance of mild GVHD may be welcome, especially in HLA mis-matched patients, as it is typically associated with a graft-versus-tumor effect.. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibitors. Both substances are structurally different but have the same mechanism of action. Cyclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (known as cyclophilin), while tacrolimus binds to the cytosolic protein Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP12. These complexes inhibit calcineurin, block dephosphorylation of the transcription factor NFAT of activated T-cells and its translocation into the nucleus. Standard prophylaxis involves the use of cyclosporine for six months with methotrexate. Cyclosporin levels should be maintained above 200 ng/ml. \\n\\nOther substances that have been studied for GvHD treatment include, for example: sirolimus, pentostatin, etanercept, and alemtuzumab. \\n\\nIn August 2017 the US FDA approved ibrutinib to treat chronic GvHD after failure of one or more other systemic treatments. \\n\\nThere are a large number of clinical trials either ongoing or recently completed in the investigation of graft-versus-host disease treatment and prevention. \\n\\nOn May 17, 2012, Osiris Therapeutics announced that Canadian health regulators approved Prochymal, its drug for acute graft-versus host disease in children who have failed to respond to steroid treatment. Prochymal is the first stem cell drug to be approved for a systemic disease. \\n\\nIn January 2016, Mesoblast released results of a Phase2 clinical trial on 241 children with acute Graft-versus-host disease, that was not responsive to steroids. The trial was of a mesenchymal stem cell therapy known as remestemcel-L or MSC-100-IV. Survival rate was 82% (vs 39% of controls) for those who showed some improvement after 1 month, and in the long term 72% (vs 18% of controls) for those that showed little effect after 1 month. \\n\\nGraft versus host disease has been implicated in eliminating several cases of HIV, including The Berlin Patient and 6 others in Spain. \\n\\nGraft-versus-tumor effect \\n\\nImmunosuppression \\n\\nTransplant rejection \\n\\nFerrara JLM, Deeg HJ, Burakoff SJ.

       "   'parsed_text': 'Visual release hallucinations, also known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome or CBS, are a type of psychophysical visual disturbance and the experience of complex visual hallucinations in a person with partial or severe blindness. \\n\\nFirst described by Charles Bonnet in 1760, the term Charles Bonnet Syndrome was first introduced into English-speaking psychiatry in 1982. A related type of hallucination that also occurs with lack of visual input is the closed-eye hallucination. \\n\\nPeople with significant vision loss may have vivid, complex recurrent visual hallucinations (fictive visual percepts). One characteristic of these hallucinations is that they usually are \" lilliputian \" (hallucinations in which the characters or objects are smaller than normal). The most common hallucination is of faces or cartoons. Sufferers understand that the hallucinations are not real, and the hallucinations are only visual, that is, they do not occur in any other senses, e.g. hearing, smell or taste. Among older adults (> 65 years) with significant vision loss, the prevalence of Charles Bonnet syndrome has been reported to be between 10% and 40%; a 2008 Australian study found the prevalence to be 17.5%. \\n\\nPeople suffering from CBS may experience a wide variety of hallucinations. Images of complex colored patterns and images of people are most common, followed by animals, plants or trees and inanimate objects. The hallucinations also often fit into the person\\'s surroundings. \\n\\nCBS predominantly affects people with visual impairments due to old age, diabetes or other damage to the eyes or optic pathways. In particular, central vision loss due to a condition such as macular degeneration combined with peripheral vision loss from glaucoma may predispose to CBS, although most people with such deficits do not develop the syndrome. \\n\\nThe syndrome can also develop after bilateral optic nerve damage due to methyl alcohol poisoning. \\n\\nBecause there is no prescribed treatment, the first starting place is to reassure the CBS sufferer of their sanity, and some charities provide specialist hallucination counseling \" buddies \" (people who have had CBS, or have CBS and are no longer fazed by it) to talk to on the telephone. \\n\\nThe physician will consider on a case-by-case basis whether to treat any depression or other problems that may be related to CBS. \\n\\nThere is no treatment of proven effectiveness for CBS. Some people experience CBS for anywhere from a few days up to many years, and these hallucinations can last only a few seconds or continue for most of the day. For those experiencing CBS, knowing that they are suffering from this syndrome and not a mental illness seems to be the best treatment so far, as it improves their ability to cope with the hallucinations. Most people with CBS meet their hallucinations with indifference, but they can still be disturbing because they may interfere with daily life. Interrupting vision for a short time by closing the eyes or blinking is sometimes helpful. \\n\\nThe disease is named after the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet, who described the condition in 1760. He first documented it in his 89-year-old grandfather who was nearly blind from cataracts in both eyes but perceived men, women, birds, carriages, buildings, tapestries, physically impossible circumstances and scaffolding patterns. \\n\\nThe syndrome is discussed in \\n\\nVilayanur S. Ramachandran\\'s book Phantoms in the Brain.

       "  {'title': 'Hidradenitis suppurativa',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, is a long term skin disease characterized by the occurrence of inflamed and swollen lumps. These are typically painful and break open, releasing fluid or pus. Scar tissue remains after healing. \\n\\nThe exact cause is usually unclear but believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve either a dysfunction of apocrine sweat glands or hair follicles. \\n\\nThere is no known cure. \\n\\nIt is estimated to affect between 1% and 4% of people. \\n\\nThe cause of HS remains unknown, and experts disagree over proposed causes. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. \\n\\nLesions occur in any body areas with hair follicles, although areas such as the axilla, groin, and perianal region are more commonly involved. This theory includes most of the following potential indicators: \\n\\nPostpubescent individuals are more likely to exhibit HS. \\n\\nPlugged apocrine (sweat) gland or hair follicle \\n\\nExcessive sweating \\n\\nAndrogen dysfunction \\n\\nGenetic disorders that alter cell structure \\n\\nPatients with more advanced cases may find exercise intolerably painful, which may increase the rate of obesity among sufferers. \\n\\nThe historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands or dysfunctional hair follicles, possibly triggered by a blocked gland, create inflammation, pain, and a swollen lesion. \\n\\nSeveral triggering factors should be taken into consideration: \\n\\nObesity is an exacerbating rather than a triggering factor, through mechanical irritation, occlusion, and skin maceration. \\n\\nTight clothing, and clothing made of heavy, non-breathable materials. \\n\\nDeodorants, depilation products, shaving of the affected area – their association with hidradenitis suppurativa is still an ongoing debate amongst researchers. \\n\\nDrugs, in particular oral contraceptives (i.e., oral hormonal birth control; \" the pill \" ) and lithium. \\n\\nHot and especially humid climates (dry/arid climates often cause remission). \\n\\nGenetic factors: an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern has been proposed. \\n\\nEndocrine factors: sex hormones, especially an excess of androgens, are thought to be involved, although the apocrine glands are not sensitive to these hormones. Women often have outbreaks before their menstrual period and after pregnancy; HS severity usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause. \\n\\nSome cases have been found to result from mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1 or PSENEN genes. The genes produce proteins that are all components of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. This complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function. Studies suggest that mutations in the NCSTN, PSEN1, or PSENEN gene impair Notch signaling in hair follicles. Although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal Notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and lead to inflammation in the skin. \\n\\nHS presents itself in three stages. Due to the large spectrum of clinical severity and the severe impact on quality of life, a reliable method for evaluating HS severity is needed. \\n\\nThis is historically the first classification system proposed, and is still in use for the classification of patients with skin/dermatologic diseases (i.e., psoriasis, HS, acne). Hurley separated patients into three groups based largely on the presence and extent of cicatrization and sinuses. It has been used as a basis for clinical trials in the past and is a useful basis to approach therapy for patients. These three stages are based on Hurley\\'s staging system, which is simple and relies on the subjective extent of the diseased tissue the patient has. Hurley\\'s three stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are: \\n\\nStage \\n\\nCharacteristics \\n\\nI \\n\\nSolitary or multiple isolated abscess formation without scarring or sinus tracts (A few minor sites with rare inflammation; may be mistaken for acne.) \\n\\nII \\n\\nRecurrent abscesses, single or multiple widely separated lesions, with sinus tract formation. (Frequent inflammation restrict movement and may require minor surgery such as incision and drainage.) \\n\\nIII \\n\\nDiffuse or broad involvement across a regional area with multiple interconnected sinus tracts and abscesses (Inflammation of sites to the size of golf balls, or sometimes baseballs; scarring develops, including subcutaneous tracts of infection – see fistula. Obviously, patients at this stage may be unable to function.) \\n\\nThe Sartorius staging system is more sophisticated than Hurley\\'s. Sartorius et al. suggested that the Hurley system is not sophisticated enough to assess treatment effects in clinical trials during research. This classification allows for better dynamic monitoring of the disease severity in individual patients. The elements of this staging system are: \\n\\nAnatomic regions involved (axilla, groin gluteal, or other region or inframammary region left or right) \\n\\nNumber and types of lesions involved (abscesses, nodules, fistulas [actually sinuses], scars, points for lesions of all regions involved) \\n\\nThe distance between lesions, in particular the longest distance between two relevant lesions (i.e., nodules and fistulas in each region or size if only one lesion present) \\n\\nThe presence of normal skin in between lesions (i.e., are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin?) \\n\\nPoints are accumulated in each of the above categories, and added to give both a regional and total score. In addition, the authors recommend adding a visual analog scale for pain or using the dermatology life quality index (DLQI, or the Skindex) when assessing HS. \\n\\nTreatment depends upon presentation and severity of the disease. Due to the poorly studied nature of the disease, the effectiveness of the drugs and therapies listed below is unclear. Possible treatments include the following: \\n\\nWarm baths may be tried in those with mild disease. \\n\\nAntibiotics: taken by mouth, these are used for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to treat infection. Most effective is a combination of rifampicin and clindamycin given concurrently for 2–3 months. A few popular antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline, and clindamycin. Topical clindamycin has been shown to have an effect in double-blind placebo controlled studies. \\n\\nCorticosteroid injections. Also known as intralesional steroids: can be particularly useful for localized disease, if the drug can be prevented from escaping via the sinuses. \\n\\nAntiandrogen therapy: hormonal therapy with antiandrogenic medications such as spironolactone, flutamide, cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol, finasteride, dutasteride, and metformin have been found to be effective in clinical studies. However, the quality of available evidence is low and does not presently allow for robust evidence-based recommendations. \\n\\nIntravenous or subcutaneous infusion of anti-inflammatory (anti-TNF-alpha) drugs such as infliximab, and etanercept. This use of these drugs is not currently Food and Drug Administration approved and is somewhat controversial, so may not be covered by insurance. \\n\\nTNF inhibitor: Studies have supported that various TNF inhibitors have a positive effect on hidradenitis suppurativa lesions. Specifically adalimumab at weekly intervals is useful. \\n\\nTopical isotretinoin is usually ineffective in people with HS and is more commonly known as a medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Individuals affected by HS who responded to isotretinoin treatment tended to have milder cases of the condition. \\n\\nWhen the process becomes chronic, wide surgical excision is the procedure of choice. Wounds in the affected area do not heal by secondary intention, and immediate or delayed application of a split-thickness skin graft is an option. \\n\\nAnother option is covering the defect with a so-called perforator flap. With this technique the (mostly totally excised) defect is covered with living tissue \\'stolen\\' from the area nearby. For example, the axilla with a fully excised defect of 15 × 7 cm can be covered with a so-called TAP flap (thoracodorsal artery perforator flap) \\n\\nThe 1064 nanometer wavelength laser for hair removal may aid in the treatment of HS. A randomized control study has shown improvement in HS lesions with the use of an Nd:YAG laser. \\n\\nIn stage III disease, fistulae left undiscovered, undiagnosed, or untreated, can rarely lead to the development of squamous cell carcinoma in the anus or other affected areas. Other stage III chronic sequelae may also include anemia, multilocalized infections, amyloidosis, and arthropathy. Stage III complications have been known to lead to sepsis, but clinical data is still uncertain. \\n\\nContractures and reduced mobility of the lower limbs and axillae due to fibrosis and scarring occur. Severe lymphedema may develop in the lower limbs. \\n\\nLocal and systemic infections (meningitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.), are seen, which may even progress to sepsis. \\n\\nInterstitial keratitis \\n\\nAnal, rectal, or urethral fistulae \\n\\nNormochromic or hypochromic anemia \\n\\nSquamous cell carcinoma: this has been found on rare occasions in chronic hidradenitis suppurativa of the anogenital region. The mean time to the onset of this type of lesion is 10 years or more and the tumors are usually highly aggressive. \\n\\nTumors of the lung and oral cavity, probably related to the high level of smoking among these patients, and liver cancer. \\n\\nHypoproteinemia and amyloidosis, which can lead to kidney failure and death \\n\\nSeronegative and usually asymmetric arthropathy: pauciarticular arthritis, polyarthritis/polyarthralgia syndrome \\n\\nFrom 1833 to 1839 in a series of three publications, Velpeau identified and described a disease we now know as hidradenitis suppurativa. \\n\\nIn 1854, Verneuil described hidradenitis suppurativa as hidrosadénite Phlegmoneuse. This is how HS obtained its alternate name \" Verneuil\\'s disease \" . \\n\\nIn 1922, Schiefferdecker hypothesized a pathogenic link between \" acne inversa \" and human sweat glands. \\n\\nIn 1956, Pillsbury et al. coined the term follicular occlusion triad for the common association of hidradenitis suppurativa, acne conglobata and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Modern clinical research still employs Pillsbury\\'s terminology for these conditions\\' descriptions. \\n\\nIn 1975, Plewig and Kligman, following Pillsbury\\'s research path, modified the \" acne triad \" , replacing it with the \" acne tetrad: acne triad, plus pilonidal sinus \" . Plewig and Kligman\\'s research follows in Pillsbury\\'s footsteps, offering explanations of the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa. \\n\\nIn 1989, Plewig and Steger\\'s research led them to rename hidradenitis suppurativa, calling it \" acne inversa \" – which is not still used today in medical terminology, although some individuals still use this outdated term. \\n\\nA surgeon from Paris, Velpeau described an unusual inflammatory process with formation of superficial axillary, submammary, and perianal abscesses, in a series of three publications from 1833 to 1839. One of his colleagues also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former pathogenetic model of acne inversa, which is considered inflammation of sweat glands as the primary cause of hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with acne conglobata and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the \" acne triad \" . Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, pilonidal sinus. Plewig et al. noted that this new \" acne tetrad \" includes all the elements found in the original \" acne triad \" , in addition to a fourth element, pilonidal sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term \" acne inversa \" , indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as \" Verneuil disease \" . \\n\\nAuthor Year Findings \\n\\nVelpeau 1839 First description of the hidradenitis suppurativa \\n\\nVerneuil 1854 \" Hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse \" \\n\\nPillsbury 1956 Acne triad (hidradenitis suppurativa, perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens, acne congoblata) \\n\\nPlewig & Kligman 1975 Acne tetrad (acne triad + pilonidal sinus) \\n\\nPlewig & Steger 1989 Acne inversa \\n\\nHidradenitis suppurativa has been referred to by multiple names in the literature, as well as in various cultures.

       "   'parsed_text': \"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs; ) are a group of about 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function. Lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling. This process requires several critical enzymes. If one of these enzymes is defective, because of a mutation, the large molecules accumulate within the cell, eventually killing it. \\n\\nLysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids, glycoproteins (sugar-containing proteins), or so-called mucopolysaccharides. Individually, LSDs occur with incidences of less than 1:100,000; however, as a group, the incidence is about 1:5,000 – 1:10,000. Most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited such as Niemann–Pick disease, type C, but a few are X-linked recessively inherited, such as Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome (MPS II). \\n\\nThe lysosome is commonly referred to as the cell's recycling center because it processes unwanted material into substances that the cell can use. Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter by enzymes, highly specialized proteins essential for survival. Lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether. When this happens, substances accumulate in the cell. In other words, when the lysosome does not function normally, excess products destined for breakdown and recycling are stored in the cell. \\n\\nLike other genetic disorders, individuals inherit lysosomal storage diseases from their parents. Although each disorder results from different gene mutations that translate into a deficiency in enzyme activity, they all share a common biochemical characteristic – all lysosomal disorders originate from an abnormal accumulation of substances inside the lysosome. \\n\\nLSDs affect mostly children and they often die at a young age, many within a few months or years of birth. \\n\\nThe LSDs are generally classified by the nature of the primary stored material involved, and can be broadly broken into the following: (ICD-10 codes are provided where available) \\n\\n(E75) Lipid storage disorders \\n\\nSphingolipidoses, including Gaucher's and Niemann–Pick diseases (E75.0-E75.1) \\n\\nGangliosidosis (including Tay–Sachs disease (E75.2) \\n\\nLeukodystrophies \\n\\n(E76.0) Mucopolysaccharidoses, including Hunter syndrome and Hurler disease \\n\\n(E77) Glycoprotein storage disorders \\n\\n(E77.0-E77.1) Mucolipidoses \\n\\nAlso, glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) is a defect in lysosomal metabolism as well, although it is otherwise classified into E74.0 in ICD-10.

They can include developmental delay, movement disorders, seizures, dementia, deafness, and/or blindness. Some people with LSD have enlarged livers or spleens, pulmonary and cardiac problems, and bones that grow abnormally. \\n\\nThe majority of patients are initially screened by enzyme assay, which is the most efficient method to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. In some families where the disease-causing mutations are known, and in certain genetic isolates, mutation analysis may be performed. In addition, after a diagnosis is made by biochemical means, mutation analysis may be performed for certain disorders. \\n\\nNo cures for lysosomal storage diseases are known, and treatment is mostly symptomatic, although bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been tried with some success. ERT can minimize symptoms and prevent permanent damage to the body. In addition, umbilical cord blood transplantation is being performed at specialized centers for a number of these diseases. In addition, substrate reduction therapy, a method used to decrease the production of storage material, is currently being evaluated for some of these diseases. Furthermore, chaperone therapy, a technique used to stabilize the defective enzymes produced by patients, is being examined for certain of these disorders. The experimental technique of gene therapy may offer cures in the future. \\n\\nAmbroxol has recently been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, so it may be a useful therapeutic agent for both Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. Ambroxol triggers the secretion of lysosomes from cells by inducing a pH-dependent calcium release from acidic calcium stores. Hence, relieving the cell from accumulating degradation products is a proposed mechanism by which this drug may help. \\n\\nTay–Sachs disease was the first of these disorders to be described, in 1881, followed by Gaucher disease in 1882. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, de Duve and colleagues, using cell fractionation techniques, cytological studies, and biochemical analyses, identified and characterized the lysosome as a cellular organelle responsible for intracellular digestion and recycling of macromolecules. This was the scientific breakthrough that would lead to the understanding of the physiological basis of the LSDs. Pompe disease was the first disease to be identified as an LSD in 1963, with L. Hers reporting the cause as a deficiency of α-glucosidase. Hers also suggested that other diseases, such as the mucopolysaccharidosis, might be due to enzyme deficiencies. \\n\\nMannosidosis \\n\\nMolecular chaperone therapy \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'La Crosse encephalitis is an encephalitis caused by an arbovirus (the La Crosse virus) which has a mosquito vector (Ochlerotatus triseriatus synonym Aedes triseriatus). \\n\\nLa Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. LAC encephalitis is rare; in the United States, about 80–100 LACV disease cases are reported each year, although it is believed to be under-reported due to minimal symptoms experienced by many of those affected. \\n\\nIt takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of LACV disease. Symptoms include nausea, headache, vomiting in milder cases and seizures, coma, paralysis and permanent brain damage in severe cases. \\n\\nLAC encephalitis initially presents as a nonspecific summertime illness with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and lethargy. Severe disease occurs most commonly in children under the age of 16 and is characterized by seizures, coma, paralysis, and a variety of neurological sequelae after recovery. Death from LAC encephalitis occurs in less than 1% of clinical cases. In many clinical settings, pediatric cases presenting with CNS involvement are routinely screened for herpes or enteroviral causes. Since there is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis, physicians often do not request the tests required to specifically identify LAC virus, and the cases are reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis of unknown cause. \\n\\nAs with many infections, the very young, the very old and the immunocompromised are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. \\n\\n{{Taxobox \\n\\n| name = La Crosse Virus \\n\\n| virus_group = v \\n\\n| ordo = Bunyavirales \\n\\n| familia = Peribunyaviridae \\n\\n| genus = Orthobunyavirus \\n\\n| species = La Crosse Virus \\n\\n}} \\n\\nThe La Crosse encephalitis virus is a type of arbovirus called a bunyavirus. The Bunyavirales are mainly arboviruses. \\n\\nMost cases of LAC encephalitis occur in children under 16 years of age. LAC virus is a zoonotic pathogen cycled between the daytime-biting treehole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus, and vertebrate amplifier hosts (chipmunks, tree squirrels) in deciduous forest habitats. The virus is maintained over the winter by transovarial transmission in mosquito eggs. If the female mosquito is infected, she may lay eggs that carry the virus, and the adults coming from those eggs may be able to transmit the virus to chipmunks and to humans. \\n\\nAnyone bitten by a mosquito in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with LACV. The risk is highest for people who live, work or recreate in woodland habitats, because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes. \\n\\nPeople reduce the chance of getting infected with LACV by preventing mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or preventive drug. \\n\\nPrevention measures against LACV include reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Use repellent such as DEET and picaridin, while spending time outside, especially at during the daytime - from dawn until dusk. Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes that transmit (LACV) are most active during the day. Wear long sleeves, pants and socks while outdoors. Ensure all screens are in good condition to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home. Aedes triseriatus prefer treeholes to lay eggs in. Also, remove stagnant water such as old tires, birdbaths, flower pots, and barrels. \\n\\nNo specific therapy is available at present for La Crosse encephalitis, and management is limited to alleviating the symptoms and balancing fluids and electrolyte levels. Intravenous ribavirin is effective against La Crosse encephalitis virus in the laboratory, and several studies in patients with severe, brain biopsy confirmed, La Crosse encephalitis are ongoing. \\n\\nIn a trial with 15 children being infected with La Crosse viral encephalitis were treated at certain phases with ribavirin (RBV). RBV appeared to be safe at moderate doses. At escalated doses of RBV, adverse events occurred and then the trial was discontinued. Nonetheless, this was the largest study of antiviral treatment for La Crosse encephalitis. \\n\\nLa Crosse encephalitis was discovered in 1965, after the virus was isolated from stored brain and spinal tissue of a child who died of an unknown infection in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1960. It occurs in the Appalachian and Midwestern regions of the United States. Recently there has been an increase of cases in the South East of the United States. An explanation to this may be that the mosquito Aedes albopictus is also an efficient vector of La Crosse virus. Aedes albopictus is a species that has entered the US and spread across the SE of the US and replaced Aedes aegypti in most areas (which is not an efficient vector of LAC). \\n\\nHistorically, most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in the upper Midwestern states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio). Recently, more cases are being reported from states in the mid-Atlantic (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) and southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi) regions of the country. It has long been suspected that LAC encephalitis has a broader distribution and a higher incidence in the eastern United States, but is under-reported because the causal agent is often not specifically identified. \\n\\nLAC encephalitis cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall, but in subtropical areas where the mosquito is found (e.g., the Gulf states), rare cases can occur in winter. \\n\\nAccording to the CDC, between 2004 and 2013 there were 787 total cases of La Crosse encephalitis and 11 deaths in the U.S. \\n\\nLooking at the distribution of cases across the United States by state, between 2004 and 2013 the most cases of La Crosse encephalitis was in North Carolina. North Carolina had 184 total cases, followed by Ohio with 178 total cases. \\n\\nSimilar diseases that are spread by mosquitoes include: Western and Eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus. \\n\\nDirectors of Health Promotion and Education Facts Sheet La Crosse Encephalitis \\n\\nEncephalitis Global Inc.

       "  {'title': 'Macular degeneration',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nMacular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field. \\n\\nMacular degeneration typically occurs in older people. \\n\\nPreventive efforts include exercising, eating well, and not smoking. There is no cure or treatment that returns vision already lost. However, dietary supplements may slow the progression in those who already have the disease. \\n\\nIn 2015 it affected 6.2 million people globally. In 2013 it was the fourth most common cause of blindness after cataracts, preterm birth, and glaucoma. It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group. About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old. \\n\\nSigns and symptoms of macular degeneration include: \\n\\n;Visual symptoms \\n\\nDistorted vision in the form of metamorphopsia, in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central scotomas, shadows or missing areas of vision \\n\\nSlow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test) \\n\\nVisual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80 \\n\\nBlurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels). \\n\\nTrouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones \\n\\nA loss in contrast sensitivity \\n\\nFormed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD \\n\\nMacular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss. \\n\\nThe area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information. \\n\\nThe loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side. Most people find this difficult to do. \\n\\nIn addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes. People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms. \\n\\nAging: Advanced age is the strongest predictor of AMD, particularly over 50. \\n\\nFamily history: \\n\\nSmoking: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of AMD by two to three times that of someone who has never smoked, and may be the most important modifiable factor in its prevention. A review of previous studies found \" a strong association between current smoking and AMD. ... Cigarette smoking is likely to have toxic effects on the retina. \" \\n\\nHypertension (high blood pressure): In the ALIENOR study 2013, early and late AMD were not significantly associated with systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP), hypertension, or use of antihypertensive medications, but elevated pulse pressure [(PP) systolic BP minus diastolic BP] was significantly associated with an increased risk of late AMD. \\n\\nAtherosclerosis \\n\\nHigh cholesterol: Elevated cholesterol may increase the risk of AMD \\n\\nObesity: Abdominal obesity is a risk factor, especially among men \\n\\nFat intake: Consuming high amounts of certain fats including saturated fats, trans fats and omega-6 fatty acids likely contributes to AMD, while monounsaturated fats are potentially protective. In particular, omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk of AMD. \\n\\nExposure to UV light from the sun or blue light from the sun or LEDs may be weakly associated with an increased risk of developing AMD. These potential risk factors are inconclusive and exposure to UV light or blue light may slightly increase the risk as compared to major risk factors like smoking and hypertension. \\n\\nRecurrence ratios for siblings of an affected individual are three- to sixfold higher than in the general population. Genetic linkage analysis has identified 5 sets of gene variants at three locations on different chromosomes (1, 6 and 10) as explaining at least 50% of the risk. These genes have roles regulating the immune response, inflammatory processes and homeostasis of the retina. Variants of these genes give rise to different kinds of dysfunction in these processes. Over time, this results in accumulation of intracellular and extracellular metabolic debris. This can cause scarring of the retina or breakdown of its vascularization. \\n\\nGenetic tests are available for some of these gene variations. However, pathogenesis of macular degeneration is a complex interaction between genetics, environment and lifestyle, and presence of unfavorable genetic factors doesn\\'t necessarily predict progression to disease. The three loci where identified gene variants are found are designated: \\n\\nComplement Factor H (CFH) on chromosome 1 at location 1q31.3 \\n\\nHTRA serine peptidase 1/Age Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2 (HTRA1/ARMS2) on chromosome 10 at location 10q26 \\n\\nComplement Factor B/Complement Component 2 (CFB/CC2) on chromosome 6 at 6p21.3 \\n\\nPolymorphisms in genes for complement system proteins: The genes for the complement system proteins factor H (CFH), factor B (CFB) and factor 3 (C3) are strongly associated with a person\\'s risk for developing AMD. CFH is involved in inhibiting the inflammatory response. The mutation in CFH (Y402H) results in reduced ability of CFH to regulate complement on critical surfaces such as the retina and leads to increased inflammatory response within the macula. Absence of the complement factor H-related genes R3 and R1 protects against AMD. Two independent studies in 2007 showed a certain common mutation Arg80Gly in the C3 gene, which is a central protein of the complement system, is strongly associated with the occurrence of AMD. The authors of both papers consider their study to underscore the influence of the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease. \\n\\nIn two 2006 studies , another gene that has implications for the disease, called HTRA1 (encoding a secreted serine protease), was identified. \\n\\nSix mutations of the gene SERPING1 (Serpin Peptidase Inhibitor, Clade G (C1 Inhibitor), Member 1) are associated with AMD. Mutations in this gene can also cause hereditary angioedema. \\n\\nFibulin-5 mutation: Rare forms of the disease are caused by genetic defects in fibulin-5, in an autosomal dominant manner. In 2004, Stone et al. performed a screen on 402 AMD patients and revealed a statistically significant correlation between mutations in fibulin-5 and incidence of the disease. \\n\\nsuch as that in the MT-ND2 molecule, predicts wet AMD. \\n\\nThe pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration is not well known, although some theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. \\n\\nThe imbalance between the production of damaged cellular components and degradation leads to the accumulation of harmful products, for example, intracellular lipofuscin and extracellular drusen. Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss. \\n\\nIn the dry (nonexudative) form, cellular debris called drusen accumulates between the retina and the choroid, causing atrophy and scarring to the retina. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid (neovascularization) behind the retina which can leak exudate and fluid and also cause hemorrhaging. \\n\\nEarly work demonstrated a family of immune mediators was plentiful in drusen. Complement factor H (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene strongly associates with AMD. Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced. Lending credibility to this has been the discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including complement component 3 (C3). \\n\\nA powerful predictor of AMD is found on chromosome 10q26 at LOC 387715. An insertion/deletion polymorphism at this site reduces expression of the ARMS2 gene though destabilization of its mRNA through deletion of the polyadenylation signal. ARMS2 protein may localize to the mitochondria and participate in energy metabolism, though much remains to be discovered about its function. \\n\\nOther gene markers of progression risk includes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), suggesting a role for extracellular matrix metabolism in AMD progression. Variations in cholesterol metabolising genes such as the hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transferase, lipoprotein lipase and the ATP-binding cassette A1 correlate with disease progression. The early stigmata of disease, drusen, are rich in cholesterol, offering face validity to the results of genome-wide association studies. \\n\\nIn AMD there is a progressive accumulation of characteristic yellow deposits, called drusen (buildup of extracellular proteins and lipids), in the macula (a part of the retina), between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. This accumulation is believed to damage the retina over time. Amyloid beta, which builds up in Alzheimer\\'s disease brains, is one of the proteins that accumulate in AMD, which is a reason why AMD is sometimes called \" Alzheimer\\'s of the eye \" or \" Alzheimer\\'s of the retina \" . \\n\\nAMD can be divided into 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late, based partially on the extent (size and number) of drusen. \\n\\nAMD-like pathology begins with small yellow deposits (drusen) in the macula, between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD. In fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous, and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated cholesterol deposits. \\n\\nEarly AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic. \\n\\nIntermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities. Intermediate AMD may cause some vision loss, but, like early AMD, it is usually asymptomatic. \\n\\nIn late AMD, enough retinal damage occurs that, in addition to drusen, people will also begin to experience symptomatic central vision loss. The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD). \\n\\nDry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD). This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy. Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80–90% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10–20% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type. \\n\\nGeographic atrophy (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function. There are multiple layers that make up the retina, and in geographic atrophy, there are three specific layers that undergo atrophy: the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the overlying photoreceptors. \\n\\nThe three layers that undergo atrophy in geographic atrophy are all adjacent to each other. The photoreceptors are the most superficial and they are the cells that are responsible for converting energy from the light from the outside world, into an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. There are several functions of the retinal pigment epithelium. One of the main functions of the retinal pigment epithelium is to minimize oxidative stress. It does so by absorbing light, and thus preventing it from getting to the underlying layers. The layers underlying the retinal pigment epithelium are very vascularlized so they have very high oxygen tension. Thus, if light was to get to those layers, many free radicals would form and cause damage to nearby tissues. The deepest layer that undergoes atrophy in geographic atrophy is called the choriocappilaris. It is a capillary network that provides nutrients to the retinal pigment epithelium. \\n\\nThe pathophysiology of geographic atrophy is still uncertain. Some studies questioned whether it was due to a deficient retinal pigment epithelium, leading to increased oxidative stress. Other studies studies have looked for inflammatory causes of damage. Thus far, the medical community is still not certain. Recent studies have begun to look at each layer individually. They found that decrease blood flow in the choriocapillaris precedes atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and the overlying photoreceptors. Since the choriocapillaris is a vascular layer, this maybe be used as an arugment for why geographic atrophy could be a disease due to decreased blood flow. \\n\\nNeovascular or exudative AMD, the \" wet \" form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth (choroidal neovascularization) in the choriocapillaris, through Bruch\\'s membrane. It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because these blood vessels are abnormal, these are also more fragile than typical blood vessels, which ultimately leads to blood and protein leakage below the macula. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated. \\n\\nAge-related accumulation of low-molecular-weight, phototoxic, pro-oxidant melanin oligomers within lysosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may be partly responsible for decreasing the digestive rate of photoreceptor outer rod segments (POS) by the RPE – autophagy. A decrease in the digestive rate of POS has been shown to be associated with lipofuscin formation – a classic sign associated with AMD. \\n\\nThe role of retinal oxidative stress in the cause of AMD by resulting in further inflammation of the macula is suggested by the enhanced rate of disease in smokers and those exposed to UV irradiation. \\n\\nMitochondrial dysfunction may play a role. \\n\\nDiagnosis of age-related macular degeneration depends on signs in the macula, not necessarily vision. \\n\\nDiagnosis of dry (or early stage) AMD may include the following clinical examinations as well as procedures and tests: \\n\\nThe transition from dry to wet AMD can happen rapidly, and if it is left untreated can lead to legal blindness in as little as six months. To prevent this from occurring and to initiate preventive strategies earlier in the disease process, dark adaptation testing may be performed. A dark adaptometer can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident. \\n\\nThere is a loss of contrast sensitivity, so that contours, shadows, and color vision are less vivid. The loss in contrast sensitivity can be quickly and easily measured by a contrast sensitivity test like Pelli Robson performed either at home or by an eye specialist. \\n\\nWhen viewing an Amsler grid, some straight lines appear wavy and some patches appear blank \\n\\nWhen viewing a Snellen chart, at least 2 lines decline \\n\\nIn dry macular degeneration, which occurs in 85–90 percent of AMD cases, drusen spots can be seen in Fundus photography \\n\\nUsing an electroretinogram, points in the macula with a weak or absent response compared to a normal eye may be found \\n\\nFarnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and Maximum Color Contrast Sensitivity test (MCCS) for assessing color acuity and color contrast sensitivity \\n\\nOptical coherence tomography is now used by most ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and the follow-up evaluation of the response to treatment with antiangiogenic drugs. \\n\\nDiagnosis of wet (or late stage) AMD may include the following in addition to the above tests: \\n\\nPreferential hyperacuity perimetry changes (for wet AMD). Preferential hyperacuity perimetry is a test that detects drastic changes in vision and involves the macula being stimulated with distorted patterns of dots and the patient identification of where in the visual field this occurs. \\n\\nIn wet macular degeneration, angiography can visualize the leakage of bloodstream behind the macula. Fluorescein angiography allows for the identification and localization of abnormal vascular processes. \\n\\nPigmentary changes in the retina – In addition to the pigmented cells in the iris (the colored part of the eye), there are pigmented cells beneath the retina. As these cells break down and release their pigment, dark clumps of released pigment and later, areas that are less pigmented may appear \\n\\nExudative changes: hemorrhages in the eye, hard exudates, subretinal/sub-RPE/intraretinal fluid \\n\\nDrusen, tiny accumulations of extracellular material that build up on the retina. While there is a tendency for drusen to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, drusen deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss. Some patients with large deposits of drusen have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of drusen are present, then, even if drusen can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision. \\n\\nA 2017 Cochrane review found the use of vitamin and mineral supplements, alone or in combination, by the general population did not affect whether or not AMD started. \\n\\nTreatment of AMD varies depending on the category of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, treatment is aimed at slowing down the progression of AMD. As of 2018, there are no treatments to reverse the effects of AMD. \\n\\nNo medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition. \\n\\nRanibizumab and aflibercept are approved VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of CNV in wet AMD. AMD can also be treated with laser coagulation therapy. \\n\\nA randomized control trial found that bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy, and reported no significant increase in adverse events with bevacizumab. A 2014 Cochrane review found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are similar when used to treat neovascular AMD, except for gastrointestinal disorders. Bevacizumab however is not FDA approved for treatment of macular degeneration. A controversy in the UK involved the off-label use of cheaper bevacizumab over the approved, but expensive, ranibizumab. Ranibizumab is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. Other approved antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of neo-vascular AMD include pegaptanib and aflibercept. \\n\\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines do not recommend laser coagulation therapy for macular degeneration, but state that it may be useful in people with new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea who don\\'t respond to drug treatment. There is strong evidence that laser coagulation will result in the disappearance of drusen but does not affect choroidal neovascularisation. A 2007 Cochrane review on found that laser photocoagulation of new blood vessels in the choroid outside of the fovea is effective and economical method, but that the benefits are limited for vessels next to or below the fovea. \\n\\nPhotodynamic therapy has also been used to treat wet AMD. The drug verteporfin is administered intravenously; light of a certain wavelength is then applied to the abnormal blood vessels. This activates the verteporfin destroying the vessels. \\n\\nCataract surgery could improve visual outcomes for people with AMD, though there have been concerns about surgery increasing the progression of AMD. A randomized controlled trial found that people who underwent immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) had improved visual acuity and better quality of life outcomes than those who underwent delayed cataract surgery (6 months). \\n\\nBecause peripheral vision is not affected, people with macular degeneration can learn to use their remaining vision to partially compensate. Assistance and resources are available in many countries and every state in the U.S. Classes for \" independent living \" are given and some technology can be obtained from a state department of rehabilitation. \\n\\nAdaptive devices can help people read. These include magnifying glasses, special eyeglass lenses, computer screen readers, and TV systems that enlarge reading the material. \\n\\nComputer screen readers such as JAWS or Thunder work with standard Windows computers. \\n\\nAlso, Apple devices provide a wide range of features (voice-over, screen readers, Braille etc.). \\n\\nVideo cameras can be fed into standard or special-purpose computer monitors, and the image can be zoomed in and magnified. These systems often include a movable table to move the written material. \\n\\nAccessible publishing provides larger fonts for printed books, patterns to make tracking easier, audiobooks and DAISY books with both text and audio. \\n\\nThe prevalence any age-related macular degeneration is higher in Europeans than in Asians and Africans. There is no difference in prevalence between Asians and Africans. The incidence of age-related macular degeneration and its associated features increases with age and is low in people <55 years of age. Smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor. Age-related macular degeneration accounts for more than 54% of all vision loss in the white population in the USA. An estimated 8 million Americans are affected with early age-related macular degeneration, of whom over 1 million will develop advanced age-related macular degeneration within the next 5 years. In the UK, age-related macular degeneration is the cause of blindness in almost 42% of those who go blind aged 65–74 years, almost two-thirds of those aged 75–84 years, and almost three-quarters of those aged 85 years or older. \\n\\nStudies indicate drusen associated with AMD are similar in molecular composition to Beta-Amyloid (βA) plaques and deposits in other age-related diseases such as Alzheimer\\'s disease and atherosclerosis. This suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases. \\n\\nA practical application of AMD-associated genetic markers is in the prediction of progression of AMD from early stages of the disease to neovascularization. \\n\\nCell based therapies using bone marrow stem cells as well as retinal pigment epithelial transplantation are being studied. A number of trials have occurred in humans with encouraging results. \\n\\nThere are a few other (rare) kinds of macular degeneration with similar symptoms but unrelated in etiology to Wet or Dry age-related macular degeneration. They are all genetic disorders that may occur in childhood or middle age. \\n\\nVitelliform macular dystrophy \\n\\nSorsby\\'s fundus dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, retinal disease characterized by sudden acuity loss resulting from untreatable submacular neovascularisation \\n\\nStargardt\\'s disease (juvenile macular degeneration, STGD) is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by juvenile-onset macular dystrophy, alterations of the peripheral retina, and subretinal deposition of lipofuscin-like material. \\n\\nSimilar symptoms with a very different etiology and different treatment can be caused by epiretinal membrane or macular pucker or any other condition affecting the macula, such as central serous retinopathy. \\n\\nJudi Dench \\n\\nJoan Plowright \\n\\nPeter Sallis \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'A ureterocele is a congenital abnormality found in the ureter. In this condition the distal ureter balloons at its opening into the bladder, forming a sac-like pouch. It is most often associated with a duplicated collection system, where two ureters drain their respective kidney instead of one. Simple ureterocele, where the condition involves only a single ureter, represents only twenty percent of cases. Ureterocele affects one in 4,000 individuals, at least four-fifths of whom are female. Patients are frequently Caucasian. \\n\\nSince the advent of the ultrasound, most ureteroceles are diagnosed prenatally. The pediatric and adult conditions are often found incidentally, i.e. through diagnostic imaging performed for unrelated reasons. \\n\\n; Intravesical : Confined within the bladder \\n\\n; Ectopic : Some part extends to the bladder neck or urethra \\n\\n; Stenotic : Intravesical ureterocele with a narrow opening \\n\\n; Sphincteric : Ectopic ureterocele with an orifice distal to the bladder neck \\n\\n; Sphincterostenotic : Orifice is both stenotic and distal to the bladder neck \\n\\n; Cecoureterocele : Ectopic ureterocele that extends into the urethra, but the orifice is in the bladder \\n\\nThe signs and symptoms of ureterocele in the latter two forms can easily be confused with other medical conditions. Symptoms can include: \\n\\nFrequent urinary tract infections \\n\\nPyelonephritis \\n\\nObstructive voiding symptoms \\n\\nUrinary retention \\n\\nFailure to thrive \\n\\nHematuria \\n\\nCyclic abdominal pain \\n\\nUrolithiasis \\n\\nCobra head sign is seen in radiography \\n\\nIn females: salpingitis, hydrosalpinx with sepsis or torsion. T.O. mass. \\n\\nMany other complications arise from ureteroceles. Redundant collection systems are usually smaller in diameter than single, and predispose the patient to impassable kidney stones. The effective \" bladder within a bladder \" compounds this problem by increasing the collision of uric acid particles, the process by which uric acid stones are formed. Ureterocele is also associated with poor kidney function. It can cause frequent blockage of the ureter leading to serious kidney damage. In other cases, a small, upper portion of the kidney is congenitally non-functional. Though often benign, this problem can necessitate the removal of non-functioning parts. \\n\\nDefinitive causes of ureterocele have not been found. While the abnormal growth occurs within the uterus, it has not been substantiated that genetics are to blame. Congenital abnormalities of the mesonephric duct in males can lead to the formation of a ureterocele, which often coincide with ipsilateral agenesis of the kidney (atrophic kidney) and seminal vesicle cysts, this is known as Zinner Syndrome. \\n\\nIVU-shows Adder head appearance or Cobra head appearance. \\n\\nCystoscopy-shows translucent cyst which is thin walled surrounding ureteric orifice \\n\\n\\tSingle-system ureterocele: initial management is usually endoscopic incision of the ureterocele, which can be followed by surgical ureteric re-implantation to preserve renal function and prevent reflux. \\n\\n\\tDuplex-system ureterocele: treatment options vary with the individual and include: endoscopic incision of the corresponding ureteric orifice in case of ureteric meatal stricture; upper pole nephrectomy for a poorly functioning unit with ureterectomy or, where there is useful renal function, ureteropyelostomy. \\n\\nHautmann, Huland: Urologie, 3.Auflage, Springer Verlag 2006, S397 f \\n\\nW.

       "   'parsed_text': 'Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), also known as Heller\\'s syndrome and disintegrative psychosis, is a rare condition characterized by late onset of developmental delays—or severe and sudden reversals—in language, social function, and motor skills. Researchers have not been successful in finding a cause for the disorder. CDD has some similarity to autism, and is sometimes considered a low-functioning form of it. In May 2013, CDD, along with other sub-types of PDD (Asperger\\'s syndrome, autism, and PDD-NOS), was fused into a single diagnostic term called \" autism spectrum disorder \" under the new DSM-5 manual. \\n\\nCDD was originally described by Austrian educator Theodor Heller (1869 & ndash;1938) in 1908, 35 years before Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger described autism. Heller had previously used the name dementia infantilis for the syndrome. \\n\\nAn apparent period of fairly normal development is often noted before a regression in skills or a series of regressions in skills. The age at which this regression can occur varies, but typically after 3 years of normal development. The regression can be so dramatic that the child may be aware of it, and may in its beginning even ask, vocally, what is happening to them. Some children describe or appear to be reacting to hallucinations, but the most obvious symptom is that skills apparently attained are lost. \\n\\nMany children are already somewhat delayed when the disorder becomes apparent, but these delays are not always obvious in young children. This has been described by many writers as a devastating condition, affecting both the family and the individual\\'s future. As is the case with all pervasive developmental disorder categories, there is considerable controversy about the right treatment for CDD. \\n\\nCDD is a rare condition, with only 1.7 cases per 100,000. \\n\\nA child affected with childhood disintegrative disorder shows normal development. Up until this point, the child has developed normally in the areas of language skills, social skills, comprehension skills, and has maintained those skills for about 2 years. However, between the ages of 2 and 10, skills acquired are lost almost completely in at least two of the following six functional areas: \\n\\nExpressive language skills (being able to produce speech and communicate a message) \\n\\nReceptive language skills (comprehension of language - listening and understanding what is communicated) \\n\\nSocial skills and self care skills \\n\\nControl over bowel and bladder \\n\\nPlay skills \\n\\nMotor skills \\n\\nLack of normal function or impairment also occurs in at least two of the following three areas: \\n\\nSocial interaction \\n\\nCommunication \\n\\nRepetitive behavior and interest patterns \\n\\nIn her book, Thinking in Pictures, Temple Grandin argues that compared to \" Kanner\\'s classic autism \" and to Asperger syndrome, CDD is characterized with more severe sensory processing disorder but less severe cognitive problems. She also argues that compared to most individuals suffering from autism, persons with CDD have more severe speech pathology and they usually do not respond well to stimulants. \\n\\nAll of the causes of childhood disintegrative disorder are still unknown. Sometimes CDD surfaces abruptly within days or weeks, while in other cases it develops over a longer period of time. A Mayo Clinic report indicates: \" Comprehensive medical and neurological examinations in children diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder seldom uncover an underlying medical or neurological cause. Although the occurrence of epilepsy is higher in children with childhood disintegrative disorder, experts don\\'t know whether epilepsy plays a role in causing the disorder. \" \\n\\nCDD, especially in cases of later age of onset, has also been associated with certain other conditions, particularly the following: \\n\\nLipid storage diseases: In this condition, a toxic buildup of excess fats (lipids) takes place in the brain and nervous system. \\n\\nSubacute sclerosing panencephalitis: Chronic infection of the brain by a form of the measles virus causes subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This condition leads to brain inflammation and the death of nerve cells. \\n\\nTuberous sclerosis (TSC): TSC is a genetic disorder. In this disorder, tumors may grow in the brain and other vital organs like kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. In this condition, noncancerous (benign) tumors, hamartomas, grow in the brain. \\n\\nLeukodystrophy: In this condition, the myelin sheath does not develop in a normal way causing white matter in the brain to eventually fail and disintegrate. \\n\\nLoss of language and skills related to social interaction and self-care are serious. The affected children face ongoing disabilities in certain areas and require long term care. Treatment of CDD involves both behavior therapy, environmental therapy and medications. \\n\\nBehavior therapy: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is considered to be the most effective form of treatment for Autism spectrum disorders by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The primary goal of ABA is to improve quality of life, and independence by teaching adaptive behaviors to children with autism, and to diminish problematic behaviors like eloping, or self-injury by using positive or negative reinforcement to encourage or discourage behaviors over-time. \\n\\nEnvironmental Therapy: Sensory Enrichment Therapy uses enrichment of the sensory experience to improve symptoms in autism, many of which are common to CDD. \\n\\nMedications: There are no medications available to directly treat CDD. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat severe behavior problems like aggressive stance and repetitive behavior patterns. Anticonvulsant medications are used to control seizures. \\n\\nDobbs, David (2016). \" The most terrifying childhood condition you\\'ve never heard of. \" Spectrum 6 July 2016, accessed 6 May 2017 at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_disintegrative_disorder?action=edit & oldid=778841596 & wteswitched=1 \\n\\nNIH/Medline',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Inguinal hernia',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nAn inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal-cavity contents through the inguinal canal. \\n\\nRisk factors for the development of a hernia include: smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, pregnancy, peritoneal dialysis, collagen vascular disease, and previous open appendectomy, among others. Hernias are partly genetic and occur more often in certain families. \\n\\nGroin hernias that do not cause symptoms in males do not need to be repaired. \\n\\nIn 2015 inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernias affected about 18.5 million people. About 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their life. Groin hernias occur most often before the age of one and after the age of fifty. \\n\\nHernias present as bulges in the groin area that can become more prominent when coughing, straining, or standing up. The bulge commonly disappears on lying down. Mild discomfort can develop over time. The inability to \" reduce \" , or place the bulge back into the abdomen usually means the hernia is \\'incarcerated\\' which requires emergency surgery. \\n\\nSignificant pain is suggestive of strangulated bowel (an incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia). \\n\\nAs the hernia progresses, contents of the abdominal cavity, such as the intestines, can descend into the hernia and run the risk of being pinched within the hernia, causing an intestinal obstruction. If the blood supply of the portion of the intestine caught in the hernia is compromised, the hernia is deemed \" strangulated \" and gut ischemia and gangrene can result, with potentially fatal consequences. The timing of complications is not predictable. \\n\\nIn men, indirect hernias follow the same route as the descending testes, which migrate from the abdomen into the scrotum during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. The larger size of their inguinal canal, which transmitted the testicle and accommodates the structures of the spermatic cord, might be one reason why men are 25 times more likely to have an inguinal hernia than women. Although several mechanisms such as strength of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and shutter mechanisms compensating for raised intra-abdominal pressure prevent hernia formation in normal individuals, the exact importance of each factor is still under debate. The physiological school of thought thinks that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch. \\n\\nFile:Blausen 0560 InguinalHernia.png|Illustration of an inguinal hernia. \\n\\nImage:Gray1084.png|Different types of inguinal hernias. \\n\\nImage:Inguinal fossae.PNG|Inguinal fossae \\n\\nThere are two types of inguinal hernia, direct and indirect, which are defined by their relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias occur medial to the inferior epigastric vessels when abdominal contents herniate through a weak spot in the fascia of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, which is formed by the transversalis fascia. Indirect inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the deep inguinal ring, lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels; this may be caused by failure of embryonic closure of the processus vaginalis. \\n\\nIn the case of the female, the opening of the superficial inguinal ring is smaller than that of the male. As a result, the possibility for hernias through the inguinal canal in males is much greater because they have a larger opening and therefore a much weaker wall through which the intestines may protrude. \\n\\nType Description Relationship to inferior epigastric vessels Covered by internal spermatic fascia? Usual onset \\n\\nindirect inguinal hernia protrudes through the inguinal ring and is ultimately the result of the failure of embryonic closure of the processus vaginalis after the testicle passes through it Lateral Yes Congenital / Adult \\n\\ndirect inguinal hernia enters through a weak point in the fascia of the abdominal wall (Hesselbach triangle) Medial No Adult \\n\\nInguinal hernias, in turn, belong to groin hernias, which also includes femoral hernias. A femoral hernia is not via the inguinal canal, but via the femoral canal, which normally allows passage of the common femoral artery and vein from the pelvis to the leg. \\n\\nIn Amyand\\'s hernia, the content of the hernial sac is the vermiform appendix. \\n\\nIn Littre\\'s hernia, the content of the hernial sac contains a Meckel\\'s diverticulum. \\n\\nClinical classification of hernia is also important according to which hernia is classified into \\n\\nReducible hernia: is one which can be pushed back into the abdomen by putting manual pressure to it. \\n\\nIrreducible/Incarcerated hernia: is one which cannot be pushed back into the abdomen by applying manual pressure. \\n\\nIrreducible hernias are further classified into \\n\\nObstructed hernia: is one in which the lumen of the herniated part of intestine is obstructed. \\n\\nStrangulated hernia: is one in which the blood supply of the hernia contents is cut off, thus, leading to ischemia. The lumen of the intestine may be patent or not. \\n\\nThe direct inguinal hernia enters through a weak point in the fascia of the abdominal wall, and its sac is noted to be medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias may occur in males or females, but males are ten times more likely to get a direct inguinal hernia. \\n\\nA direct inguinal hernia protrudes through a weakened area in the transversalis fascia near the medial inguinal fossa within an anatomic region known as the inguinal or Hesselbach\\'s triangle, an area defined by the edge of the rectus abdominis muscle, the inguinal ligament and the inferior epigastric artery. These hernias are capable of exiting via the superficial inguinal ring and are unable to extend into the scrotum. \\n\\nWhen a patient suffers a simultaneous direct and indirect hernia on the same side, the result is called a \" pantaloon \" hernia (because it looks like a pair of pants, with the epigastric vessels in the crotch), and the defects can be repaired separately or together. \\n\\nSince the abdominal walls weaken with age, direct hernias tend to occur in the middle-aged and elderly. This is in contrast to indirect hernias which can occur at any age including the young, since their etiology includes a congenital component where the inguinal canal is left more patent (compared to individuals less susceptible to indirect hernias). Additional risk factors include chronic constipation, overweight/obesity, chronic cough, family history and prior episodes of direct inguinal hernias. \\n\\nAn indirect inguinal hernia results from the failure of embryonic closure of the deep inguinal ring after the testicle has passed through it. It is the most common cause of groin hernia. \\n\\nIn the male fetus, the peritoneum gives a coat to the testicle as it passes through this ring, forming a temporary connection called the processus vaginalis. In normal development, the processus is obliterated once the testicle is completely descended. The permanent coat of peritoneum that remains around the testicle is called the tunica vaginalis. The testicle remains connected to its blood vessels and the vas deferens, which make up the spermatic cord and descend through the inguinal canal to the scrotum. \\n\\nThe deep inguinal ring, which is the beginning of the inguinal canal, remains as an opening in the fascia transversalis, which forms the fascial inner wall of the spermatic cord. When the opening is larger than necessary for passage of the spermatic cord, the stage is set for an indirect inguinal hernia. The protrusion of peritoneum through the internal inguinal ring can be considered an incomplete obliteration of the processus. \\n\\nIn an indirect inguinal hernia, the protrusion passes through the deep inguinal ring and is located lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. Hence, the conjoint tendon is not weakened. \\n\\nThere are three main types \\n\\nBubonocele: in this case the hernia is limited in inguinal canal. \\n\\nFunicular: here the processus vaginalis is closed at its lower end just above the epididymis. The content of the hernial sac can be felt separately from the testis which lies below the hernia. \\n\\nComplete (or scrotal): here the processus vaginalis is patent throughout. The hernial sac is continuous with the tunica vaginalis of the testis. The hernia descends down to the bottom of the scrotum and it is difficult to differentiate the testis from hernia. \\n\\nIn the female, groin hernias are only 4% as common as in males. Indirect inguinal hernia is still the most common groin hernia for females. If a woman has an indirect inguinal hernia, her internal inguinal ring is patent, which is abnormal for females. The protrusion of peritoneum is not called \" processus vaginalis \" in women, as this structure is related to the migration of the testicle to the scrotum. It is simply a hernia sac. The eventual destination of the hernia contents for a woman is the labium majus on the same side, and hernias can enlarge one labium dramatically if they are allowed to progress. \\n\\nA physician may diagnose an inguinal hernia, as well as the type, from medical history and physical examination. For confirmation or in uncertain cases, medical ultrasonography is the first choice of imaging, because it can both detect the hernia and evaluate its changes with for example pressure, standing and Valsalva maneuver. A major diagnostic finding is an increased diameter of the inguinal canal, which is normally up to 13 mm at the deep inguinal ring. \\n\\nWhen assessed by ultrasound or cross sectional imaging with CT or MRI, the major differential in diagnosing indirect inguinal hernias is differentiation from spermatic cord lipomas, as both can contain only fat and extend along the inguinal canal into the scrotum. \\n\\nOn axial CT, lipomas originate posterolateral to the cord, and are located inside the cremaster muscle, while inguinal hernias lie anteromedial to the cord and are not intramuscular. Large lipomas may appear nearly indistinguishable as the fat engulfs anatomic boundaries, but they do not change position with coughing or straining. \\n\\nDifferential diagnosis of the symptoms of inguinal hernia mainly includes the following potential conditions: \\n\\nFemoral hernia \\n\\nEpididymitis \\n\\nTesticular torsion \\n\\nLipomas \\n\\nInguinal adenopathy (Lymph node Swelling) \\n\\nGroin abscess \\n\\nSaphenous vein dilation, called Saphena varix \\n\\nVascular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm \\n\\nHydrocele \\n\\nVaricocele \\n\\nCryptorchidism (Undescended testes) \\n\\nThere is currently no medical recommendation about how to manage an inguinal hernia condition in adults, due to the fact that, until recently, elective surgery used to be recommended. The hernia truss is intended to contain a reducible inguinal hernia within the abdomen. It is not considered to provide a cure, and if the pads are hard and intrude into the hernia aperture they may cause scarring and enlargement of the aperture. In addition, most trusses with older designs are not able effectively to contain the hernia at all times, because their pads do not remain permanently in contact with the hernia. The more modern variety of truss is made with non-intrusive flat pads and comes with a guarantee to hold the hernia securely during all activities. Although there is as yet no proof that such devices can prevent an inguinal hernia from progressing, they have been described by users as providing greater confidence and comfort when carrying out physically demanding tasks. A truss also increases the probability of complications, which include strangulation of the hernia, atrophy of the spermatic cord, and atrophy of the fascial margins. This allows the defect to enlarge and makes subsequent repair more difficult. Their popularity is likely to increase, as many individuals with small, painless hernias are now delaying hernia surgery due to the risk of post-herniorrhaphy pain syndrome. The elasticised pants used by athletes also provide useful support for the smaller hernia. \\n\\nSurgical correction of inguinal hernias is called a hernia repair. It is not recommended in minimally symptomatic hernias, for which watchful waiting is advised, due to the risk of post herniorraphy pain syndrome. Surgery is commonly performed as outpatient surgery. There are various surgical strategies which may be considered in the planning of inguinal hernia repair. These include the consideration of mesh use (e.g. synthetic or biologic), open repair, use of laparoscopy, type of anesthesia (general or local), appropriateness of bilateral repair, etc. Laparoscopy is most commonly used for non-emergency cases, however, a minimally invasive open repair may have a lower incidence of post-operative nausea and mesh associated pain. During surgery conducted under local anaesthesia, the patient will be asked to cough and strain during the procedure to help in demonstrating that the repair is without tension and sound. \\n\\nConstipation after hernia repair results in strain to evacuate the bowel causing pain, and fear that the sutures may rupture. Opioid analgesia makes constipation worse. Promoting an easy bowel motion is important post-operatively. \\n\\nSurgical correction is always recommended for inguinal hernias in children. \\n\\nEmergency surgery for incarceration and strangulation carry much higher risk than planned, \" elective \" procedures. However, the risk of incarceration is low, evaluated at 0.2% per year. On the other hand, surgery has a risk of inguinodynia (10-12%), and this is why males with minimal symptoms are advised to watchful waiting. However, if they experience discomfort while doing physical activities or they routinely avoid them for fear of pain, they should seek surgical evaluation. For female patients, surgery is recommended even for asymptomatic patients. \\n\\nA direct inguinal hernia is less common (~25–30% of inguinal hernias) and usually occurs in men over 40 years of age. \\n\\nMen have an 8 times higher incidence of inguinal hernia than women. \\n\\nBirkett hernia \\n\\nIndirect Inguinal Hernia - University of Connecticut Health Center \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Irukandji syndrome is a condition that results from envenomation by certain box jellyfish. In rare instances the sting may result in cardiac arrest and death. The most common jellyfish involved is the Carukia barnesi, a species of Irukandji jellyfish. \\n\\nThe syndrome was given its name in 1952 by Hugo Flecker, after the Aboriginal Irukandji people who live in Palm Cove, north of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, where stings are common. \\n\\nMost stings occur during the summer wet season in October–May in North Queensland, with different seasonal patterns elsewhere. Because jellyfish are very small, the venom is only injected through the tips of the nematocysts (the cnidocysts) rather than the entire lengths; as a result the sting may barely be noticed at first. It has been described as feeling like little more than a mosquito bite. The symptoms, however, gradually become apparent and then more and more intense in the subsequent 5 to 120 minutes (30 minutes on average). Irukandji syndrome includes an array of systemic symptoms, including severe headache, backache, muscle pains, chest and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, sweating, anxiety, hypertension, tachycardia and pulmonary edema. Symptoms generally improve in four to 30 hours, but may take up to two weeks to resolve completely. \\n\\nWhen properly treated, a single sting is almost never fatal; however, two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings, which has greatly increased public awareness of Irukandji syndrome. It is unknown how many other deaths from Irukandji syndrome have been wrongly attributed to other causes. \\n\\nThe exact mechanism of action of the venom is unknown, but catecholamine excess may be an underlying mechanism in severe cases. Animal studies appear to confirm a relationship between envenoming and an increase in circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline. \\n\\nSimilar to other box jellyfish stings, first aid consists of flushing the area with vinegar to neutralize the tentacle stinging apparatus. As no antivenom is available, treatment is largely supportive, with analgesia being the mainstay of management. Nitroglycerin, a common drug used for cardiac conditions, is utilised by medical personnel to minimise the risk of pulmonary edema and to reduce hypertension. Antihistamines may be of benefit for pain relief, but most cases require intravenous opioid analgesia. Fentanyl or morphine are usually chosen. Pethidine (meperidine, brand name Demerol in the US) should be avoided, as large doses are often required for pain relief and in this situation significant adverse effects from the pethidine metabolite norpethidine may occur. \\n\\nMagnesium sulfate has been proposed as a treatment for Irukandji syndrome after being apparently successfully used in one case. Early evidence suggested a benefit; however, according to a later report, a series of three patients failed to show any improvement with magnesium; the author reiterated the experimental status of this treatment. Some preliminary laboratory experiments using the venom extracted from Malo maxima (the \\'Broome Irukandji\\') on rat cardiovascular tissue in vitro has suggested that magnesium does in fact block many of the actions of this venom. \\n\\nReports of Irukandji syndrome have come from Australia, Hawaii, Florida, the French Antilles, Bonaire, the Caribbean, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea. \\n\\nIn 1964 Jack Barnes confirmed the cause of the syndrome was a sting from a small box jellyfish: the Irukandji jellyfish, which can fire venom-filled stingers out of its body and into passing victims. To prove that the jellyfish was the cause of the syndrome, he captured one and deliberately stung himself while his son Nick and a local lifeguard then observed the resulting symptoms (before rushing him to the ICU). Other cubozoans possibly can cause Irukandji syndrome; those positively identified include Carukia barnesi, Alatina cf. mordens, Alatina alata, Malo maximus, Malo kingi, Carybdea xaymacana, Keesingia gigas, an as-yet unnamed \" fire jelly \" , and another unnamed species. \\n\\nA 2005 Discovery Channel program, Killer Jellyfish, portrayed the severity of the pain from an Irukandji jellyfish sting when two Australian researchers (Jamie Seymour and Teresa Carrette) were stung. Another program aired on the Discovery Channel, Stings, Fangs and Spines, featured a 20-minute spot on Irukandji syndrome. In the segment, a young Australian woman was stung and developed a severe case. \\n\\nA 2007 fictional Sea Patrol episode (S1, E4) involves two crew members of HMAS Hammersley being stung by an Irukandji jellyfish. \\n\\nOn the television program Super Animal, a woman compared her experience with Irukandji syndrome to the pain from childbirth. \\n\\nSteve Backshall reports with accounts from victims of Irukandji stings on his ITV wildlife series Fierce in 2016. \\n\\n',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Maturity onset diabetes of the young',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': 'Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) refers to any of several hereditary forms of diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in an autosomal dominant gene disrupting insulin production. MODY is often referred to as monogenic diabetes to distinguish it from the more common types of diabetes (especially type 1 and type 2), which involve more complex combinations of causes involving multiple genes and environmental factors. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms. MODY should not be confused with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) & mdash; a form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence than child-onset type 1 DM, and which occurs later in life. \\n\\nMODY is the final diagnosis in 1% & ndash;2% of people initially diagnosed with diabetes. The prevalence is 70–110 per million people. 50% of first-degree relatives will inherit the same mutation, giving them a greater than 95% lifetime risk of developing MODY themselves. For this reason, correct diagnosis of this condition is important. Typically patients present with a strong family history of diabetes (any type) and the onset of symptoms is in the second to fifth decade. \\n\\nThere are two general types of clinical presentation. \\n\\nSome forms of MODY produce significant hyperglycemia and the typical signs and symptoms of diabetes: increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria). \\n\\nIn contrast, many people with MODY have no signs or symptoms and are diagnosed either by accident, when a high glucose is discovered during testing for other reasons, or screening of relatives of a person discovered to have diabetes. Discovery of mild hyperglycemia during a routine glucose tolerance test for pregnancy is particularly characteristic. \\n\\nMODY cases may make up as many as 5% of presumed type 1 and type 2 diabetes cases in a large clinic population. While the goals of diabetes management are the same no matter what type, there are two primary advantages of confirming a diagnosis of MODY. \\n\\nInsulin may not be necessary and it may be possible to switch a person from insulin injections to oral agents without loss of glycemic control. \\n\\nIt may prompt screening of relatives and so help identify other cases in family members. \\n\\nAs it occurs infrequently, many cases of MODY are initially assumed to be more common forms of diabetes: type 1 if the patient is young and not overweight, type 2 if the patient is overweight, or gestational diabetes if the patient is pregnant. Standard diabetes treatments (insulin for type 1 and gestational diabetes, and oral hypoglycemic agents for type 2) are often initiated before the doctor suspects a more unusual form of diabetes. \\n\\nSome sources make a distinction between two forms of monogenetic diabetes: MODY and neonatal diabetes. However, they have much in common and are often studied together. \\n\\nMODY is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and most patients therefore have other members of the family with diabetes; penetrance differs between the types (from 40% to 90%). \\n\\nType \\n\\nOMIM \\n\\nGene/protein \\n\\nDescription \\n\\nMODY 1 \\n\\nhepatocyte nuclear factor 4α \\n\\nDue to a loss-of-function mutation in the HNF4α gene. 5% & ndash;10% cases. \\n\\nMODY 2 \\n\\nglucokinase \\n\\nDue to any of several mutations in the GCK gene. 30% & ndash;70% cases.

Most common type of MODY in populations with European ancestry. Tend to be responsive to sulfonylureas.

Very rare: 5 families reported to date. \\n\\nMODY 7 \\n\\nKruppel-like factor 11 \\n\\nKLF11 has been associated with a form of diabetes that has been characterized as \" MODY7 \" by OMIM. \\n\\nMODY 8 \\n\\nBile salt dependent lipase \\n\\nCEL has been associated with a form of diabetes that has been characterized as \" MODY8 \" by OMIM. It is very rare with five families reported to date. It is associated with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. \\n\\nMODY 9 \\n\\nPAX4 \\n\\nPax4 is a transcription factor. MODY 9 is a very rare medical condition. \\n\\nMODY 10 \\n\\nINS \\n\\nMutations in the insulin gene. Usually associated with neonatal diabetes. Rare < 1% cases. \\n\\nMODY 11 \\n\\nBLK \\n\\nMutated B-lymphocyte tyrosin kinase, which is also present in pancreatic islet cells. Very rare. \\n\\nPermanent neonatal diabetes mellitus \\n\\nKCNJ11 and ABCC8 \\n\\nA newly identified and potentially treatable form of monogenic diabetes is the neonatal diabetes caused by activating mutations of the ABCC8 or KCNJ11 genes which encode subunits of the K channel. < 1% cases. Tend to respond to sulfonylureas. \\n\\nTransient neonatal diabetes mellitus \\n\\nABCC8 \\n\\nSome forms of neonatal-onset diabetes are not permanent. < 1% cases. Tend to respond to sulfonylureas. \\n\\nBy definition, the forms of MODY are autosomal dominant, requiring only one abnormal gene to produce the disease; the severity of the disease is moderated by the presence of a second, normal allele which presumably functions normally. However, conditions involving people carrying two abnormal alleles have been identified. Unsurprisingly, combined (homozygous) defects of these genes are much rarer and much more severe in their effects. \\n\\nMODY2: Homozygous glucokinase deficiency causes severe congenital insulin deficiency resulting in persistent neonatal diabetes mellitus. About 6 cases have been reported worldwide. All have required insulin treatment from shortly after birth. The condition does not seem to improve with age. \\n\\nMODY4: Homozygous IPF1 results in failure of the pancreas to form. Congenital absence of the pancreas, termed pancreatic agenesis, involves deficiency of both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. \\n\\nHomozygous mutations in the other forms have not yet been described. Those mutations for which a homozygous form has not been described may be extremely rare, may result in clinical problems not yet recognized as connected to the monogenic disorder, or may be lethal for a fetus and not result in a viable child. \\n\\nThe recognised forms of MODY are all due to ineffective insulin production or release by pancreatic beta cells. Several of the defects are mutations of transcription factor genes. One form is due to mutations of the glucokinase gene. For each form of MODY, multiple specific mutations involving different amino acid substitutions have been discovered. In some cases, there are significant differences in the activity of the mutant gene product that contribute to variations in the clinical features of the diabetes (such as degree of insulin deficiency or age of onset). \\n\\nThe following characteristics suggest the possibility of a diagnosis of MODY in hyperglycemic and diabetic patients: \\n\\nMild to moderate hyperglycemia (typically 130–250 mg/dl, or 7–14 mmol/l) discovered before 30 years of age. However, anyone under 50 can develop MODY. \\n\\nA first-degree relative with a similar degree of diabetes. \\n\\nAbsence of positive antibodies or other autoimmunity (e.g., thyroiditis) in patient and family. However, Urbanova et al. found that about one quarter of Central European MODY patients are positive for islet cell autoantibodies (GADA and IA2A). Their expression is transient but highly prevalent. The autoantibodies were found in patients with delayed diabetes onset, and in times of insufficient diabetes control. The islet cell autoantibodies are absent in MODY in at least some populations (Japanese, Britons). \\n\\nPersistence of a low insulin requirement (e.g., less than 0.5 u/kg/day) past the usual \" honeymoon \" period. \\n\\nAbsence of obesity (although overweight or obese people can get MODY) or other problems associated with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome). \\n\\nInsulin resistance very rarely happens. \\n\\nCystic kidney disease in patient or close relatives. \\n\\nNon-transient neonatal diabetes, or apparent type 1 diabetes with onset before six months of age. \\n\\nLiver adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma in MODY type 3 \\n\\nRenal cysts, rudimentary or bicornuate uterus, vaginal aplasia, absence of the vas deferens, epidymal cysts in MODY type 5 \\n\\nThe diagnosis of MODY is confirmed by specific gene testing available through commercial laboratories. \\n\\nIn some forms of MODY, standard treatment is appropriate, though exceptions occur: \\n\\nIn MODY2, oral agents are relatively ineffective, however most patients are managed conservatively through diet and exercise. \\n\\nIn MODY1 and MODY3, sulfonylureas are usually very effective, delaying the need for insulin treatment. \\n\\nSulfonylureas are effective in the K \\n\\nChronic hyperglycemia due to any cause can eventually cause blood vessel damage and the microvascular complications of diabetes. The principal treatment goals for people with MODY & mdash; keeping the blood sugars as close to normal as possible ( \" good glycemic control \" ), while minimizing other vascular risk factors & mdash; are the same for all known forms of diabetes. \\n\\nThe tools for management are similar for all forms of diabetes: blood testing, changes in diet, physical exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin injections. In many cases these goals can be achieved more easily with MODY than with ordinary types 1 and 2 diabetes. Some people with MODY may require insulin injections to achieve the same glycemic control that another person may attain with careful eating or an oral medication. \\n\\nWhen oral hypoglycemic agents are used in MODY, the sulfonylureas remain the oral medication of first resort. When compared to patients with type 2 diabetes, MODY patients are often more sensitive to sulphonylureas, such that a lower dose should be used to initiate treatment to avoid hypoglycaemia. Patients with MODY less often suffer from obesity and insulin resistance than those with ordinary type 2 diabetes (for whom insulin sensitizers like metformin or the thiazolidinediones are often preferred over the sulfonylureas). \\n\\nAccording to data from Saxony, Germany, MODY was responsible for 2.4% of diabetes incidence in children younger than 15 years. \\n\\nThe term MODY dates back to 1964, when diabetes mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to what we now call type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success. \\n\\nThe current usage of the term MODY dates from a case report published in 1974. \\n\\nSince the 1990s, as the understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes has improved, the concept and usage of MODY have become refined and narrower. It is now used as a synonym for dominantly inherited, monogenic defects of insulin secretion occurring at any age, and no longer includes any forms of type 2 diabetes. \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': \"Physical or chemical injuries of the eye can be a serious threat to vision if not treated appropriately and in a timely fashion. The most obvious presentation of ocular (eye) injuries is redness and pain of the affected eyes. This is not, however, universally true, as tiny metallic projectiles may cause neither symptom. Tiny metallic projectiles should be suspected when a patient reports metal on metal contact, such as with hammering a metal surface. Corneal foreign body is one of the most common preventable occupational hazard. Intraocular foreign bodies do not cause pain because of the lack of nerve endings in the vitreous humour and retina that can transmit pain sensations. As such, general or emergency department doctors should refer cases involving the posterior segment of the eye or intraocular foreign bodies to an ophthalmologist. Ideally, ointment would not be used when referring to an ophthalmologist, since it diminishes the ability to carry out a thorough eye examination. \\n\\nFlicking sand, flying pieces of wood, metal, glass and stone are notorious for causing much of the eye trauma. Sporting balls such as cricket ball, lawn tennis ball, squash ball, shuttlecock, and other high speed flying objects can strike the eye. The eye is also susceptible to blunt trauma in a fistfight. Children’s games such as bow-and-arrows, bb guns and firecrackers can lead to eye trauma. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) with head and facial trauma may also have an eye injury - these are usually severe in nature with multiple lacerations, shards of glasses embedded in tissues, orbital fractures, severe hematoma and penetrating open-globe injuries with prolapse of eye contents. Other causes of intraocular trauma may arise from workplace tools or even common household implements. \\n\\nAbout 5.3 million cases of foreign bodies in the eyes occurred in 2013. \\n\\nMultiple complications are known to occur following eye injury: corneal scarring, hyphema, iridodialysis, post-traumatic glaucoma, uveitis cataract, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. The complications risk is high with retinal tears, penetrating injuries and severe blunt trauma. \\n\\nThe goal of investigation is the assessment of the severity of the ocular injury with an eye to implementing a management plan as soon as is required. The usual eye examination should be attempted, and may require a topical anesthetic in order to be tolerable. Many topical agents cause burning upon instillation. Proxymetacaine has been found to have the best tolerance. \\n\\nDepending on the medical history and preliminary examination, the primary care physician should designate the eye injury as a true emergency, urgent or semi-urgent. \\n\\nBased on the injury to the eyewall(outer fibrous coat of the eye consisting of cornea and sclera) \\n\\nClosed globe injury: The eye globe is intact, but the seven rings of the eye have been classically described as affected by blunt trauma.Types include:1) Contusion 2)Lamellar Laceration \\n\\nOpen globe injury: There is a full thickness injury of the eye wall(cornea and sclera) \\n\\nIt includes \\n\\nA) Globe rupture:caused by blunt trauma and is an inside-out injury. \\n\\nB) Globe laceration:It is full-thickness wound caused by sharp objects. It includes \\n\\n1)Penetrating trauma:The globe integrity is disrupted by a full-thickness entry wound and may be associated with prolapse of the internal contents of the eye. Such injuries are often referred to as a Globe fracture or a Globe rupture, although these can be incurred by blunt trauma as well. \\n\\n2) Perforating trauma: The globe integrity is disrupted in two places due to an entrance and exit wound (through and through injury). This is a quite severe type of eye injury. \\n\\nOther types include \\n\\nBlowout fracture of the orbit is caused by blunt trauma, classically described for fist or ball injury, leading to fracture of the floor or medial wall of the orbit due to sudden increased pressure on the orbital contents. \\n\\nMuscular Entrapment Fracture of the orbital bones can lead to muscular entrapment limiting gaze in one direction. \\n\\nForeign bodies (FBs) in the eye are usually classified as intraocular (IOFB) or extraocular (EOFB). In IOFB the FB is within the eye ball and in EOFB it is outside. This classification seems oversimplified. Hence a new classification is proposed on the basis of FB locations, in which adnexal FBs (in orbit, lids, conjunctiva and lacrimal apparatus) are also included. These are further classified according to their exact location. FBs can also be classified in many other ways. Besides IOFB and EOFB, another condition IMFB (intramural foreign body) is also described. The FBs are situated within cornea or sclera and are neither IOFB nor EOFB. Ocular trauma also includes trauma to ocular adnexa and hence the terms IOFB and EOFB have been replaced by IGFB (intraglobal foreign body) and EGFB (extraglobal foreign body) \\n\\nThe conventional system has been a useful classification system for the last two decades. However, one of its major limitations is that it is not sufficiently comprehensive and a third of ocular trauma cases cannot be classified by adopting this conventional classification system. The conventional classification system was the basis for the development of our newly proposed classification system. Our system aimed to classify all cases of ocular trauma, and we were able to do so with the addition of three categories, namely, nonmechanical injury, adnexal injury, and destructive globe injuries. This proposed classification can be adopted for further multicenter study as it represents the most current available knowledge of ocular trauma. \\n\\nAn emergency must be treated within minutes. This would include chemical burns of both \\n\\nthe conjunctiva and cornea. \\n\\nAn urgent case must be treated within hours. This includes penetrating globe injuries; corneal abrasions or corneal foreign bodies; hyphema (must be referred); eyelid lacerations that are deep, involve the lid margin or involve the lacrimal canaliculi; radiant energy burns such as arc eye (welder's burn) or snow blindness; or, rarely, traumatic optic neuropathy. \\n\\nSemi-urgent cases must be managed within 1–2 days. They include orbital fractures and subconjunctival hemorrhages. \\n\\nThe first line of management for chemical injuries is usually copious irrigation of the eye with an isotonic saline or sterile water. In the cases of chemical burns, one should not try to buffer the solution, but instead dilute it with copious flushing. \\n\\nDepending on the type of ocular injury, either a pressure patch or shield patch should be applied. Up until circa 1987, pressure patches were the preferred method of treatment for corneal abrasions in non-contact lens wearers; Multiple controlled studies conducted by accredited organizations such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology have shown that pressure patching is of little or no value in healing corneal abrasions and is actually detrimental to healing in some cases. A Cochrane Review found that patching simple corneal abrasions may not improve healing or reduce pain. Pressure patching should never be used on an individual presenting with a corneal abrasion who has a history of contact lens wear. In this circumstance, a virulent infection caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is at a clearly delineated increased risk for occurrence. These infections can cause blindness within 24 – 48 hours and there is a possibility that the infection can move into the peri-orbital socket, resulting in the need for evisceration of the eyeball. In rare cases, the infection can enter the brain and cause death to the patient. \\n\\nIn cases of globe penetration, pressure patches should never be applied, and instead a shield patch should be applied that protects the eye without applying any pressure. If a shield patch is applied to one eye, the other eye should also be patched due to eye movement. If the uninjured eye moves, the injured eye will also move involuntarily possibly causing more damage. \\n\\nIn cases of eyelid laceration, sutures may be a part of appropriate management by the primary care physician so long as the laceration does not threaten the canaliculi, is not deep, and does not affect the lid margins. \\n\\nEating certain products and using special routines may help recovery. \\n\\nA recent study estimated that from 2002–2003 there were 27,152 injuries in the United States related to the wearing of eyeglasses. The same study concluded that sports-related injuries due to eyeglasses wear were more common in those under the age of 18 and that fall-related injuries due to wearing eyeglasses were more common in those aged 65 and over. \\n\\nIn India, injuries are found more in males (81%). This is true for both rural and urban populations, but in the 0–10 age group, the difference between males and females is less. Females account for 28% of injuries in this age group. In sedentary workers, farmers, labourers and industrial workers, the male percentage is as high as 95%. Chemical accidents are a common cause of bilateral eye injury. \\n\\nBlack eye \\n\\nChemical eye injury \\n\\nList of eye diseases and disorders \\n\\nUnited States Eye Injury Registry \\n\\nWilderness medical emergencies \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Taijin kyofusho (対人恐怖症 taijin kyōfushō, TKS, for taijin kyofusho symptoms) is a Japanese culture-specific syndrome. The term taijin kyofusho translates into the disorder (sho) of fear (kyofu) of interpersonal relations (taijin). Those who have taijin kyofusho are likely to be extremely embarrassed about themselves or fearful of displeasing others when it comes to the functions of their bodies or their appearances. These bodily functions and appearances include their faces, odor, actions, or even looks. They do not want to embarrass other people with their presence. This culture-bound syndrome is a social phobia based on fear and anxiety. \\n\\nThe symptoms of this disorder include avoiding social outings and activities, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, panic attacks, trembling, and feelings of dread and panic when around people. The causes of this disorder are mainly from emotional trauma or psychological defense mechanism. It is more common in men than women. Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 3–13%. \\n\\nTaijin kyofusho is commonly described as a form of social anxiety (social phobia), with the person dreading and avoiding social contact, and as a subtype of shinkeishitsu (anxiety disorder). However, instead of a fear of embarrassing themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness, sufferers of taijin kyofusho report a fear of offending or harming other people. The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself. \\n\\nIn the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), variants of taijin kyofusho (shubo-kyofu and jikoshu-kyofu) are listed under 300.3 (F42) \" Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders \" . \\n\\nOne source even breaks taijin kyofusho into two different subtypes: neurotic and offensive. The first subtype can be broken into two parts that are classical type and avoidant type. The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive. Some of their fears include body odor, gas, excessive or insufficient eye contact, blushing, etc. \\n\\nIn the official Japanese diagnostic system, taijin kyofusho is subdivided into the following categories: \\n\\nSekimen-kyofu (), the phobia of blushing (ereuthophobia) \\n\\nShubo-kyofu (), the phobia of a deformed body, similar to body dysmorphic disorder \\n\\nJikoshisen-kyofu (), the phobia of eye contact \\n\\nJikoshu-kyofu (), the phobia of having foul body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome, osmophobia or bromidrosiphobia) \\n\\nJapan psychology also recognizes additional types of taijin kyofusho based on severity: \\n\\nTransient: This type of taijin kyofusho is short-lived and moderately severe. It most commonly appears in teens, but may occur at any time. \\n\\nDelusional: This is the most common type of taijin kyofusho and is the most similar to social phobia. It is chronic, often begins before the age of 30, and varies in severity from moderate to severe. \\n\\nPhobic with schizophrenia: This is a more complicated disorder. In such cases, rather than a phobia, taijin kyofusho is a manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms. \\n\\nA person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through shame, embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so. The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion. The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have, and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed. \\n\\nA problem with culture-bound syndromes is that they are resistant to some medicine. } The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is Morita therapy, developed by Shoma Morita in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu (nervousness). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced bed rest, diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and group treatments. This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho. Other treatments include systematic desensitization, which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear, and learning relaxation skills, to extinguish fear and anxiety. \\n\\nMilnacipran, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related social anxiety disorder. The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations. \\n\\nTypically, this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and shyness. \\n\\nClinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females, despite the fact that females scored higher on a social phobia scale than men, and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males. \\n\\nAnthropophobia \\n\\nAvoidant personality disorder \\n\\nHikikomori \\n\\nNEET \\n\\nObsessive–compulsive disorder \\n\\nhttp://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/taijin-kyofusho-the-disorder-of-fear \\n\\nhttp://anthropology.msu.edu/anp204-us12/2012/07/20/taijin-kyofusho-in-japan-and-south-korea/ \\n\\nhttp://www.stolaf.edu/depts/ciswp/khughes/papers/psychopathology.pdf \\n\\nhttp://jcc.sagepub.com/content/43/2/219.abstract',\n",

A year or two may be required for healing to occur. \\n\\nPeople usually present with a history of falling on an outstretched hand and complaint of pain and swelling around the wrist, sometimes with deformity around the wrist. \\n\\nSwelling, deformity, tenderness, and loss of wrist motion are normal features on examination of a person with a distal radius fracture. \" Dinner fork \" deformity of the wrist is caused by dorsal displacement of the carpal bones (Colle\\'s fracture). Reverse deformity is seen in volar angulation (Smith\\'s fracture). The wrist may be radially deviated due to shortening of the radius bone. \\n\\n{{multiple image \\n\\n| align = center \\n\\n| direction = horizontal \\n\\n| image1 = Distalradiusfracture.jpg \\n\\n| width1 = 200 \\n\\n| alt1 = \\n\\n| caption1 = Malreduced distal radius fracture demonstrating the deformity in the wrist \\n\\n| image2 = \" Dinner fork \" Deformity.jpg \\n\\n| width2 = 400 \\n\\n| alt2 = Dorsal displacement of carpal bones seen in dorsally angulated distal radius fracture, creating a fork-like appearance \\n\\n| caption2 = \" Dinner fork \" deformity \\n\\n}} \\n\\nNonunion is rare; almost all of these fractures heal. Malunion, however, is not uncommon, and can lead to residual pain, grip weakness, reduced range of motion (especially rotation), and persistent deformity. Symptomatic malunion may require additional surgery. If the joint surface is damaged and heals with more than 1–2 mm of unevenness, the wrist joint will be prone to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Half of nonosteoporotic patients will develop post-traumatic arthritis, specifically limited radial deviation and wrist flexion. This arthritis can worsen over time. Displaced fractures of the ulnar styloid base associated with a distal radius fracture result in instability of the DRUJ and resulting loss of forearm rotation. \\n\\nNerve injury, especially of the median nerve and presenting as carpal tunnel syndrome, is commonly reported following distal radius fractures. Tendon injury can occur in people treated both nonoperatively and operatively, most commonly to the extensor pollicis longus tendon. This can be due to the tendon coming in contact with protruding bone or with hardware placed following surgical procedures. \\n\\nComplex regional pain syndrome is also associated with distal radius fractures, and can present with pain, swelling, changes in color and temperature, and/or joint contracture. The cause for this condition is unknown. \\n\\nThe most common cause of this type of fracture is a fall on an outstretched hand from standing height, although some fractures will be due to high-energy injury. People who fall on the outstretched hand are usually fitter and have better reflexes when compared to those with elbow or humerus fractures. The characteristics of distal radius fractures are influenced by the position of the hand at the time of impact, the type of surface at point of contact, the speed of the impact, and the strength of the bone. Distal radius fractures typically occur with the wrist bent back from 60 to 90 degrees. \\n\\nCommon injuries associated with distal radius fractures are interosseous intercarpal ligaments injuries, especially scapholunate (4.7% to 46% of cases) and lunotriquetral ligaments (12% to 34% of cases) injuries. There is an increased risk of interosseous intercarpal injury if the ulnar variance (the difference in height between the distal end of the ulna and the distal end of the radius) is more than 2mm and there is fracture into the wrist joint. \\n\\nDiagnosis may be evident clinically when the distal radius is deformed, but should be confirmed by X-ray. \\n\\nThe differential diagnosis includes scaphoid fractures and wrist dislocations, which can also co-exist with a distal radius fracture. Occasionally, fractures may not be seen on X-rays immediately after the injury. Delayed X-rays, X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can confirm the diagnosis. \\n\\nX-ray of the affected wrist is required if a fracture is suspected. Posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique views can be used together to describe the fracture. \\n\\nA CT scan is often performed to further investigate the articular anatomy of the fracture, especially for fracture and displacement within the distal radio-ulnar joint. \\n\\nVarious kinds of information can be obtained from X-rays of the wrist: \\n\\nLateral view \\n\\nCarpal malalignment - A line is drawn along the long axis of the capitate bone and another line is drawn along the long axis of the radius. If the carpal bones are aligned, both lines will intersect within the carpal bones. If the carpal bones are not aligned, both lines will intersect outside the carpal bones. Carpal malignment is frequently associated with dorsal or volar tilt of the radius and will have poor grip strength and poor forearm rotation. \\n\\nTear drop angle - It is the angle between the line that pass through the central axis of the volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius and the line that pass through the long axis of the radius. Tear drop angle less than 45 degrees indicates displacement of lunate facet. \\n\\nAntero-posterior distance (AP distance) - Seen on lateral X-ray, it is the distance between the dorsal and volar rim of the lunate facet of the radius. The usual distance is 19 mm. Increased AP distance indicates the lunate facet fracture. \\n\\nVolar or dorsal tilt - A line is drawn joining the most distal ends of the volar and dorsal side of the radius. Another line perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the radius is drawn. The angle between the two lines is the angle of volar or dorsal tilt of the wrist. Measurement of volar or dorsal tilt should be made in true lateral view of the wrist because pronation of the forearm reduces the volar tilt and supination increases it. When dorsal tilt is more than 11 degrees, it is associated with loss of grip strength and loss of wrist flexion. \\n\\nPosteroanterior view \\n\\nRadial inclination - It is the angle between a line drawn from the radial styloid to the medial end of the articular surface of the radius and a line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the radius. Loss of radial inclination is associated with loss of grip strength. \\n\\nRadial length - It is the vertical distance in millimetres between a line tangential to the articular surface of the ulna and a tangential line drawn at the most distal point of radius (radial styloid). Shortening of radial length more than 4mm is associated with wrist pain. \\n\\nUlnar variance - It is the vertical distance between a horizontal line parallel to the articular surface of the radius and another horizontal line drawn parallel to the articular surface of the ulnar head. Positive ulnar variance (ulna appears longer than radius) disturbs the integrity of triangular fibrocartilage complex and is associated with loss of grip strength and wrist pain. \\n\\nOblique view \\n\\nPronated oblique view of the distal radius helps to show the degree of comminution of the distal end radius, depression of the radial styloid, and confirming the position the screws at the radial side of the distal end radius. Meanwhile, a supinated oblique view of shows the ulnar side of the distal radius, accessing the depression of dorsal rim of the lunate facet, and the position of the screws on the ulnar side of the distal end radius. \\n\\nThere are many classification systems for distal radius fracture. AO/OTA classification is adopted by Orthopaedic Trauma Association and is the most commonly used classification system. There are three major groups: A—extra-articular, B—partial articular, and C—complete articular which can further subdivided into nine main groups and 27 subgroups depending on the degree of communication and direction of displacement. However, none of the classification systems demonstrate good liability. A qualification modifier (Q) is used for associated ulnar fracture. \\n\\nCorrection should be undertaken if the wrist radiology falls outside the acceptable limits: \\n\\n2-3mm positive ulnar variance \\n\\nThere should be no carpus malalignment \\n\\nIf carpus is aligned, then the dorsal tilt should be less than 10 degrees \\n\\nIf carpus is aligned, there are no limits for palmar tilt \\n\\nIf carpus is malaligned, wrist tilt should be neutral \\n\\nGap or step deformity is less than 2mm \\n\\nTreatment options for distal radius fractures include nonoperative management, external fixation, and internal fixation. Indications for each depend on a variety of factors such as the patient\\'s age, initial fracture displacement, and metaphyseal and articular alignment, with the ultimate goal to maximize strength and function in the affected upper extremity. Surgeons use these factors combined with radiologic imaging to predict fracture instability, and functional outcome to help decide which approach would be most appropriate. Treatment is often directed to restore normal anatomy to avoid the possibility of malunion, which may cause decreased strength in the hand and wrist. The decision to pursue a specific type of management varies greatly by geography, physician specialty (hand surgeons vs. orthopedic surgeons), and advancements in new technology such as the volar locking plating system. \\n\\nDistal radius fractures are often associated with distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) injuries, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends that postreduction lateral wrist X-rays should be obtained in all patients with distal radius fractures in order to preclude DRUJ injuries or dislocations. \\n\\nThe majority of distal radius fractures are treated with conservative nonoperative management, which involves immobilization through application of plaster or splint with or without closed reduction. The prevalence of nonoperative approach to distal radius fractures is around 70%. Nonoperative management is indicated for fractures that are undisplaced, or for displaced fractures that are stable following reduction. Variations in immobilization techniques involve the type of cast, position of immobilization, and the length of time required in the cast. \\n\\nFor those with low demand, cast and splint can be applied for two weeks. In those who are young and active, if the fracture is not displaced, the patient can be followed up in one week. If the fracture is still undisplaced, cast and splint can be applied for three weeks. If the fracture is displaced, then manipulative reduction or surgical stabilisation is required. Shorter immobilization is associated with better recovery when compared to prolonged immobilization. 10% of the minimally displaced fractures will become unstable in the first two weeks and cause malunion. Therefore, follow up within the first week of fracture is important. 22% of the minimally displaced fractures will malunite after two weeks. Subsequent follow ups at two to three weeks are therefore also important. \\n\\nWhere the fracture is undisplaced and stable, nonoperative treatment involves immobilization. Initially, a backslab or a sugar tong splint is applied to allow swelling to expand and subsequently a cast is applied. \\n\\nIn displaced distal radius fracture, in those with low demands, the hand can be cast until the person feels comfortable. If the fracture affects the median nerve, only then is a reduction indicated. If the instability risk is less than 70%, the hand can be manipulated under regional block or general anaesthesia to achieve reduction. If the post reduction radiology of the wrist is acceptable, then the person can come for follow up at one, two, or three weeks to look for any displacement of fractures during this period. If the reduction is maintained, then the cast should continue for 4 to 6 weeks. If the fracture is displaced, surgical management is the proper treatment. If the instability risk of the wrist is more than 70%, then surgical management is required. 43% of displaced fractures will be unstable within the first two weeks and 47% of the remaining unstable fractures will become unstable after two weeks. Therefore, periodic reviews are important to prevent malunion of the displaced fractures. \\n\\nClosed reduction of a distal radius fracture involves first anesthetizing the affected area with a hematoma block, intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier\\'s block), sedation or a general anesthesia. \\n\\nFailure of nonoperative treatment leading to functional impairment and anatomic deformity is the largest risk associated with conservative management. Prior studies have shown that the fracture often redisplaces to its original position even in a cast. Only 27-32% of fractures are in acceptable alignment 5 weeks after closed reduction. For those less than 60 years in age, there will be a dorsal angulation of 13 degrees, while for those older than 60, the dorsal angulation can reach as high as 18 degrees. In people over 60, functional impairment can last for more than 10 years. \\n\\nDespite these risks with nonoperative treatment, more recent systematic reviews suggest that when indicated, nonsurgical management in the elderly population may lead to similar functional outcomes as surgical approaches. In these studies, no significant differences in pain scores, grip strength, and range of motion in patients\\' wrists occurred when comparing conservative nonsurgical approaches with surgical management. Although the nonsurgical group exhibited greater anatomic misalignment such as radial deviation, and ulnar variance, these changes did not seem to have significant impact on overall pain and quality of life. \\n\\nThe techniques of surgical management include open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, or some combination of the above. The choice of operative treatment is often determined by the type of fracture, which can be categorized broadly into three groups: partial articular fractures, displaced articular fractures, and metaphyseal unstable extra- or minimal articular fractures. \\n\\nSignificant advances have been made in ORIF treatments. Two newer treatment are fragment-specific fixation and fixed-angle volar plating. These attempt fixation rigid enough to allow almost immediate mobility, in an effort to minimize stiffness and improve ultimate function; no improved final outcome from early mobilization (prior to 6 weeks after surgical fixation) has been shown. Although restoration of radiocarpal alignment is thought to be of obvious importance, the exact amount of angulation, shortening, intra-articular gap/step which impact final function are not exactly known. The alignment of the DRUJ is also important, as this can be a source of a pain and loss of rotation after final healing and maximum recovery. \\n\\nAn arthroscope can be used at the time of fixation to evaluate for soft-tissue injury. Structures at risk include the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the scapholunate ligament. Scapholunate injuries in radial styloid fractures where the fracture line exits distally at the scapholunate interval should be considered. TFCC injuries causing obvious DRUJ instability can be addressed at the time of fixation. \\n\\nPrognosis varies depending on dozens of variables. If the anatomy (bony alignment) is not properly restored, function may remain poor even after healing. Restoration of bony alignment is not a guarantee of success, as soft tissue contributes significantly to the healing process. \\n\\nThese fractures are the most common of the three groups mentioned above that require surgical management. A minimal articular fracture involves the joint, but does not require reduction of the joint. Manipulative reduction and immobilization were thought to be appropriate for metaphyseal unstable fractures. However, several studies suggest this approach is largely ineffective in patients with high functional demand, and in this case, more stable fixation techniques should be used. \\n\\nSurgical options have been shown to be successful in patients with unstable extra-articular or minimal articular distal radius fractures. These options include percutaneous pinning, external fixation, and ORIF using plating. Patients with low functional demand of their wrists can be treated successfully with nonsurgical management; however, in more active and fit patients with fractures that are reducible by closed means, nonbridging external fixation is preferred, as it has less serious complications when compared to other surgical options. \\n\\nIf the fractures are unlikely to be reduced by closed means, open reduction with internal plate fixation is preferred. \\n\\nThese fractures, although less common, often require surgery in active, healthy patients to address displacement of both the joint and the metaphysis. The two mainstays of treatment are bridging external fixation or ORIF. If reduction can be achieved by closed/percutaneous reduction, then open reduction can generally be avoided. Percutaneous pinning is preferred to plating due to similar clinical and radiological outcomes, as well as lower costs, when compared to plating, despite increased risk of superficial infections. Level of joint restoration, as opposed to surgical technique, has been found to be a better indicator of functional outcomes. \\n\\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) divides outcomes into three categories: impairment, disabilities, and handicaps. Impairment is the abnormal physical function, such as lack of forearm rotation. It is measured clinically. Disability is the lack of ability to perform physical daily activities. It is measured by Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs). Examples of scoring system based on clinical assessment are: Mayo Wrist Score (for perilunate fracture dislocation), Green and O’Brien Score (carpal dislocation and pain), and Gartland and Werley Score (evaluating distal radius fractures). These scores includes assessment of range of motion, grip strength, ability to perform activities of daily living, and radiological picture. However, none of the three scoring system demonstrated good reliability. \\n\\nThere are also two scoring systems for Patient Reported Outome Measures (PROMs): the Disabilities of Hand, Arm and Shoulder (DASH) Score and the Patient-Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Score. These scoring systems measures the ability of a person to perform a task, pain score, presence of tingling and numbness, the effect on activities of daily living, and self-image. Both scoring systems show good reliability and validity. \\n\\nIn children, the outcome of distal radius fracture is usually very good with healing and return to normal function expected. Some residual deformity is common, but this often remodels as the child grows. \\n\\nIn young patients, the injury requires greater force and results in more displacement, particularly to the articular surface. Unless an accurate reduction of the joint surface is obtained, these patients are very likely to have long-term symptoms of pain, arthritis, and stiffness. \\n\\nIn the elderly, distal radius fractures heal and may result in adequate function following nonoperative treatment. A large proportion of these fractures occur in elderly people who may have less requirement for strenuous use of their wrists. Some of these patients tolerate severe deformities and minor loss of wrist motion very well, even without reduction of the fracture. There is no difference in functional outcomes between operative and non-operative management in the elderly age group, despite better anatomical results in the operative group. \\n\\nDistal radius fractures are the most common fractures seen in adults, accounting for 17.5% of all adult fractures with an approximate rate of 23.6 to 25.8 per 100,000 per year. Incidences in females outnumber incidences in males by a factor of three to two. Average age of occurrence is between 57 and 66 years. Men who sustain distal radius fractures are usually younger, generally in their 40s (vs. 60s in females). Low energy injury (usually fall from standing height) is the usual cause of distal end radius fracture (66 to 77% of cases). High energy injuries accounts for 10% of wrist fractures. \\n\\nBefore the 18th century, distal radius fracture was believed to be due to dislocation of the carpal bones or the displacement of the distal radioulnar articulation. In the 18th century, Petit first suggested that these types of injuries might be due to fractures rather than dislocations. Another author, Pouteau, suggested the common mechanism of injury which leads to this type of fractures - injury to the wrist when a person falls on an outstretched hand with dorsal displacement of the wrist. However, he also suggested that volar displacement of the wrist was due to the ulnar fracture. His work was met with skepticism from colleagues and little recognition, since the article was published after he died. In 1814, Abraham Colles described the characteristics of distal end radius fracture. In 1841, Guilaume Dupuytren acknowledged the contributions by Petit and Pouteau, agreeing that the distal end radius fracture is indeed a fracture, not a dislocation. In 1847, Malgaigne described the mechanism of injury for distal end radius fractures which can be caused by falling on the outstretched hand or on the back of the hand, and also the consequences if the hand fracture is not treated adequately. After that, Robert William Smith, professor of surgery in Dublin, Ireland, first described the characteristics of volar displacement of distal radius fractures. In 1895, with the advent of X-rays, the visualisation of the distal radius fracture become more apparent. Lucas-Champonnière first described the management of fractures using massage and early mobilization techniques. Anaesthesia, aseptic technique, immbolization, and external fixation all have contributed to the management of fixation of distal radius fracture. Ombredanne, a Parisian surgeon in 1929, first reported the use of nonbridging external fixation in the management of distal radius fractures. Bridging external fixation was first introduced by Roger Anderson and Gordon O’Neill from Seattle in 1944 due to poor results in conservative management (using orthopaedic cast) of distal end radius fractures. Raoul Hoffman of Geneva designed orthopaedic clamps which allow adjustments of the external fixator to reduce the fractures by closed reduction. In 1907, percutaneous pinning was first used. This was followed by the use of plating in 1965. \\n\\nOrthopaedic Trauma Association Fracture Classification Radius and Ulna \\n\\nWheeless\\' Textbook of Orthopaedics Fractures of the Radius',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a heterogeneous condition consisting of the inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). It can be monophasic or recurrent. Currently at least three different kinds are proposed based on the presence of autoantibodies thought to produce the disease: anti-AQP4, anti-MOG and anti-NF. All the cases are considered autoimmune diseases. \\n\\nSpinal cord lesions lead to varying degrees of weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation (including blindness), and/or bladder and bowel dysfunction. \\n\\nDevic\\'s disease is now studied along a collection of similar diseases called \" Neuromyelitis optica spectrum diseases \" . \\n\\nThe main symptoms of Devic\\'s disease are loss of vision and spinal cord function. Optic neuritis may manifest as visual impairment with decreased visual acuity, although visual field defects, or loss of color vision may occur in isolation or prior to formal loss of acuity. Spinal cord dysfunction can lead to muscle weakness, reduced sensation, or loss of bladder and bowel control. The typical patient has an acute and severe spastic weakness of the legs (paraparesis) or all four limbs (quadriparesis) with sensory signs, often accompanied by loss of bladder control. \\n\\nDevic\\'s disease was associated in the past with many systemic diseases, based on anecdotal evidence. The discovery of NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) has opened a new way into the research for the causes. Currently three principal causes are accepted: \\n\\nA first subset of patients is anti-AQP4+. In them, the cause of the neuromyelitis optica (understood as the syndrome) is an autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy, due to these specific autoantibodies. In these cases, astrocytes are the victims of the autoimmune attack. \\n\\nA second subset of patients is anti-MOG+. In them the cause is an anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis, \\n\\nIn a third subset of patients, NMO is due to the presence of anti-neurofascin (anti-NF) auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in NMO. \\n\\nRarely, it has been reported that some courses of anti-NMDAR are consistent with NMO . It is not excluded the possibility that new kinds of autoantibodies could appear in NMO. \\n\\nIn the AQP4+ cases, these auto-antibodies target the protein aquaporin 4 in the cell membranes of astrocytes which acts as a channel for the transport of water across the cell membrane. \\n\\nAquaporin 4 is found in the astrocytes that surround the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a system responsible for preventing substances in the blood from crossing into the brain. The blood–brain barrier is weakened in Devic\\'s disease, but it is currently unknown how the auto-antibodies cross the BBB. Some reports point to the metalloproteinase-2 and interleukin-6 as culprits for the BBB failure. There is broad consensus that AQP4/NMO-IgG initially enters the brain via BBB-deficient sites such as area postrema, where access to CSF occurs. \\n\\nThere are \" normal appearing areas \" in NMO but compared to patients with MS, NAWM damage is less extensive. \\n\\nMost research into the pathology of Devic\\'s disease has focused on the spinal cord. The damage can range from inflammatory demyelination to necrotic damage of the white and grey matters. The inflammatory lesions in Devic\\'s disease have been classified as type II lesions (complement-mediated demyelinization), but they differ from MS pattern II lesions in their prominent perivascular distribution. Therefore, the pattern of inflammation is often quite distinct from that seen in MS. \\n\\nAbout the presence of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies, some researchers have pointed out that some other cases could be paraneoplastic. It seems also clear that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies sometimes, leading to some cases of lupus-derived NMO. \\n\\nAQP4+ NMO is the most common and is considered an autoimmune astrocytopathy or autoimmune astrocytic channelopathy) in which a person\\'s own immune system attacks the astrocytes of the optic nerves and spinal cord. \\n\\nIn Anti-AQP4 positive variants, CNS astrocytes, which are the basis for the glymphatic system are the target of the autoimmune attack. NMO-IgG-negative cases are less understood. It seems currently that astrocytes are spared in these IgG negative cases. \\n\\nCurrently, the second most documented auto-antibody in NMO is anti-MOG autoantibody. \\n\\nMOG antibodies are currently considered mostly absent in similar diseases like multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it can be said that anti-MOG is a group contained inside AQP-Negative NMO. \\n\\nTogether with the anti-AQP4 they form the wider part of the NMO spectrum. They classify the NMO cases in four classes, according to the presence or absence of any of these two main auto-antibodies. \\n\\nThe clinical course and the response to therapy is different for these groups, showing a better prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(−)/MOG-Ab(−) group, and a worse prognosis for those in the NMO-Ab(+)/MOG-Ab(+) group. The MOG-related neuromyelitis optica can be radiologically identified by the conus involvement. Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody–positive patients were more likely to have conus involvement on spinal magnetic resonance imaging. \\n\\nNF auto antibodies can also appear in NMO cases. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in NMO. \\n\\nThe Mayo Clinic proposed a revised set of criteria for diagnosis of Devic\\'s disease in 2006. Those new guidelines require two absolute criteria plus at least two of three supportive criteria. In 2015 a new review was published by an international panel refining the previous clinical case definition but leaving the main criteria unmodified: \\n\\nAbsolute criteria: \\n\\nOptic neuritis \\n\\nAcute myelitis \\n\\nSupportive criteria: \\n\\nBrain MRI not meeting criteria for MS at disease onset \\n\\nSpinal cord MRI with continuous T2-weighted signal abnormality extending over three or more vertebral segments, indicating a relatively large lesion in the spinal cord \\n\\nNMO-IgG seropositive status (The NMO-IgG test checks the existence of antibodies against the aquaporin 4 antigen.) \\n\\nSince the discovery of AQP4 autoantibody, it has been found that it appears also in patients with NMO-like symptoms that do not fulfill the clinical requirements to be diagnosed NMO (Recurrent and simultaneous optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation). \\n\\nThe term NMOSD (NMO Spectrum Disorders) has been designed to allow incorporation of cases associated a non-AQP4 biomarkers. \\n\\nThe collection of these condition has been named \" neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders \" (NMSD) and they are expected to respond to the same treatments as standard NMO. Some authors propose to use the name \" autoimmune aquaporin-4 channelopathy \" for these diseases, \\n\\nAfter the development of the NMO-IgG test, the spectrum of disorders comprising Devic\\'s disease was expanded. The spectrum is now believed to consist of: \\n\\nStandard Devic\\'s disease, according to the diagnostic criteria described above \\n\\nLimited forms of Devic\\'s disease, such as single or recurrent events of longitudinally extensive myelitis, and bilateral simultaneous or recurrent optic neuritis \\n\\nAsian optic-spinal MS (OSMS), or AQP4+ OSMS. This variant can present brain lesions like MS, but it should not be confused with an AQP4-negative form of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system spectrum, sometimes called optic-spinal MS. \\n\\nLongitudinally extensive myelitis or optic neuritis associated with systemic autoimmune disease \\n\\nOptic neuritis or myelitis associated with lesions in specific brain areas such as the hypothalamus, periventricular nucleus, and brainstem \\n\\nNMO-IgG negative NMO: AQP4 antibody-seronegative NMO poses a diagnostic challenge. Some cases could be related to anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantibodies. \\n\\nWhether Devic\\'s disease is a distinct disease or part of the wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. Devic\\'s disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as transverse myelitis, and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic\\'s disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients. \\n\\nRecently, AQP4 has been found to distinguish standard multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica, but as MS is a heterogeneous condition, and some MS cases are reported to be Kir4.1 channelopathies (autoimmunity against the potassium channels) it is still possible to consider NMO as part of the MS spectrum. Besides, some NMO-AQP(−) variants are not astrocytopathic, but demyelinating. \\n\\nTumefactive demyelinating lesions in NMO are not usual, but they have been reported to appear in several cases mistakenly treated with interferon beta. \\n\\nAlso an overlap with the Sjögren syndrome has been reported \\n\\nAQP4-Ab-negative NMO presents problems for diagnosis. The behavior of the oligoclonal bands respect MS can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands in NMO are rare and they tend to disappear after the attacks, while in MS they are nearly always present and persistent. \\n\\nIt is important to notice for differential diagnosis that, though uncommon, it is possible to have longitudinal lesions in MS. \\n\\nOther problem for diagnosis is that AQP4ab in MOGab levels can be too low to be detected. Some additional biomarkers have been proposed. \\n\\nCurrently, there is no cure for Devic\\'s disease, but symptoms can be treated. Some patients recover, but many are left with impairment of vision and limbs, which can be severe. \\n\\nAttacks are treated with short courses of high dosage intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone IV. \\n\\nPlasmapheresis can be an effective treatment when attacks progress or do not respond to corticosteroid treatment. Clinical trials for these treatments contain very small numbers, and most are uncontrolled, though some report high success percentage. \\n\\nTreatment in order to prevent relapses within neuromyelitis optica is generally employed, though the exact duration of prophylaxis is still debated. In 2019, eculizumab became the first and only medication to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in adults who are AQP4 antibody positive. Other immunosuppressant treatments that are used include azathioprine (Imuran) plus prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil plus prednisone, mitoxantrone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide. \\n\\nB-cell depletion, which indirectly reduces the antibody levels, has been tried with the monoclonal antibody rituximab, showing good results. \\n\\nSeveral other disease modifying therapies are being tried. In 2007, Devic\\'s disease was reported to be responsive to glatiramer acetate and to low-dose corticosteroids. Use of Mycophenolate mofetil is also currently under research. \\n\\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is sometimes used in severe cases of NMO. Currently available data suggest that this procedure can reduce inflammatory activity in the short term, but a clear majority of the patients will relapse within 5\\u2009years. \\n\\nNormally, some measure of improvement appears in a few weeks, but residual signs and disability may persist, sometimes severely. \\n\\nThe disease can be monophasic, i.e. a single episode with permanent remission. However, at least 85% of patients have a relapsing form of the disease with repeated attacks of transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. In patients with the monophasic form, the transverse myelitis and optic neuritis occur simultaneously or within days of each other. On the other hand, patients with the relapsing form are more likely to have weeks or months between the initial attacks, and to have better motor recovery after the initial transverse myelitis event. Relapses usually occur early, with about 55% of patients having a relapse in the first year and 90% in the first five years. \\n\\nIt is possible that the relapsing form is related to the antiAQP4+ seropositive status and the monophasic form related to its absence Unlike multiple sclerosis, Devic\\'s disease rarely has a secondary progressive phase in which patients have increasing neurologic decline between attacks without remission. Instead, disabilities arise from the acute attacks. \\n\\nApproximately 20% of patients with monophasic Devic\\'s disease have permanent visual loss, and 30% have permanent paralysis in one or both legs. Among patients with relapsing Devic\\'s disease, 50% have paralysis or blindness within five years. In some patients (33% in one study), transverse myelitis in the cervical spinal cord resulted in respiratory failure and subsequent death. However, the spectrum of Devic\\'s disease has widened due to improved diagnostic criteria, and the options for treatment have improved; as a result, researchers believe these estimates will be lowered. \\n\\nThe prevalence and incidence of Devic\\'s disease has not been established, partly because the disease is underrecognized and often confused with MS. \\n\\nA retrospective study found that prevalence of NMOsd was 1.5% inside a random sample of neurological patients, with a MS:NMOsd ratio of 42.7. Among 13 NMOsd patients, 77% had long spinal cord lesions, 38% had severe optic neuritis and 23% had brain or brainstem lesions. Only 56% had clinically definite NMO at follow-up. \\n\\nAccording to the Walton Centre in England, \" NMO seems to be present across the world unlike MS, which has a higher incidence in temperate climates and white races. Africans and Asians especially in Far East may have a higher risk of NMO, although the exact incidence of this disease is unknown, making specific conclusions difficult \" . Although many people who have Devic\\'s disease were initially misdiagnosed with MS, 35% of African Americans are often misdiagnosed with MS when they really have NMO. \\n\\nDevic\\'s disease is more common in Asians than Caucasians. In fact, Asian optic-spinal MS (which constitutes 30% of the cases of MS in Japan) has been suggested to be identical to Devic\\'s disease (differences between optic-spinal and classic MS in Japanese patients). In the indigenous populations of tropical and subtropical regions, MS is rare, but when it appears, it often takes the form of optic-spinal MS. \\n\\nThe majority of Devic\\'s disease patients have no affected relatives, and it is generally regarded as a nonfamilial condition. \\n\\nFirst reports on an association of spinal cord and optic nerve disorders date back to the late 18th and early 19th century. However, only an 1870 report by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt created sustained interest of neurologists and ophthalmologists in this rare syndrome. In 1894, Eugène Devic and his PhD student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost vision in one or both eyes and within weeks developed severe spastic weakness of the limbs, loss of sensation and often bladder control. They recognized these symptoms were the result of inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively. \\n\\nSimilar instances of optic neuritis and myelitis were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity. However, some patients had pathology in other parts of the brain, a feature which was more suggestive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or MS. \\n\\nIn 2002, Mayo Clinic researchers identified an humoral mechanism, targeting a perivascular protein, as the culprit for NMO and in 2004 an unknown specific autoantibody was found. In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as the target of the disease, and developed a test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic\\'s disease by detection of an antibody, AQP4-IgG, in the blood. \\n\\nLater some other auto-antibodies have been found in NMO AQP4-negative cases, like anti-MOG IgG, but some NMO Anti-AQP4-negative cases still remain idiopathic. \\n\\nSince the discovery of AQP-4 involvement, some research studies have focused on targeted treatment aimed at anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies. The most established method for antibody removal is plasmapheresis. A number of drugs are being studied: aquaporumab (non-pathogenic antibody blocker of AQP4-IgG binding), sivelestat (neutrophil elastase inhibitor), and eculizumab (complement inhibitor). \\n\\nThere is little research into the primary causes of the Anti-AQP4 auto-antibodies. It has been noticed that some cases could be paraneoplastic. \\n\\nIn addition, several NMO variants have been discovered with antibodies other than those for AQP4, turning NMO into a heterogeneous disease. Six different patterns of damage have been reported in NMO, raising the possibility of six different types of auto-antibodies. As of 2019 only three of them are known. \\n\\nA new auto-antibody (GFAP) was found in 2016 in transverse myelitis (LETM) and atypical NMO, leading to the concept of Autoimmune GFAP Astrocytopathy. \\n\\nOther auto-antibody under research is flotillin. It has been found in seronegative NMO and some MS patients \\n\\nFinally, other proteins under study are Connexin 43 and anti-AQP1 though, as of 2015, there are only initial reports about the involvement of these proteins \\n\\nThe group AQP+/MOG+ is very small and it can be considered a coincidence of two independent problems in the same person. Assuming these cases could be verified, currently five different kinds of NMO are being considered: \\n\\nNMO derived from an autoimmune channelopathy (AQP4-Ab+), around 80% of the cases \\n\\nNMO derived from an antiMOG associated encephalomyelitis, around 10% of the cases \\n\\nConnexin-43 NMO \\n\\nAquaporin-1 associated NMO which could be related to pattern III MS \\n\\nIdiopatic NMO, defined by the absence of all previous antibodies \\n\\nSome cases of NMO are not due to auto-antibodies. They constitute an overlap between NMO and Multiple sclerosis. Some statistical studies show that antibody negative NMO can be classified in three groups, and that this classification has a pathogenic meaning. \\n\\nCassie Mitchell (Paralympian and biomedical engineering professor) \\n\\nChristine Hà (chef and author) \\n\\nMultiple sclerosis \\n\\nIdiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases \\n\\n',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Neurapraxia',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': ' \\n\\nNeurapraxia is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system in which there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, usually lasting an average of six to eight weeks before full recovery. Neurapraxia is derived from the word apraxia, meaning “loss or impairment of the ability to execute complex coordinated movements without muscular or sensory impairment”. \\n\\nThis condition is typically caused by a blunt neural injury due to external blows or shock-like injuries to muscle fibers and skeletal nerve fibers, which leads to repeated or prolonged pressure buildup on the nerve. As a result of this pressure, ischemia occurs, a neural lesion results, and the human body naturally responds with edema extending in all directions from the source of the pressure. This lesion causes a complete or partial action potential conduction block over a segment of a nerve fiber and thus a reduction or loss of function in parts of the neural connection downstream from the lesion, leading to muscle weakness. \\n\\nNeurapraxia results in temporary damage to the myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact and is an impermanent condition; thus, Wallerian degeneration does not occur in neurapraxia. In order for the condition to be considered neurapraxia, according to the Seddon classification system of peripheral nerve injury, there must be a complete and relatively rapid recovery of motor and sensory function once nerve conduction has been restored; otherwise, the injury would be classified as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Thus, neurapraxia is the mildest classification of peripheral nerve injury. \\n\\nNeurapraxia is very common in professional athletes, especially American football players, and is a condition that can and should be treated by a physician. \\n\\nA variety of nerve types can be subjected to neurapraxia and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity. Common symptoms of neurapraxia are disturbances in sensation, weakness of muscle, vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis in the region of the affected nerve or nerves, and abnormal sensitivity of the nerve at the point of injury. It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning sensations at the site of the injury. Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch, pain, heat, and cold. \\n\\nSymptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury. However, in severe cases of neurapraxia, symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time. \\n\\nThe cause of neurapraxia is a neural lesion which causes a temporary block of nerve conduction without transection of the axon. A conduction block is classified as a 40% reduction in action potential amplitude over a short distance on the nerve, or a 50% reduction for a longer distance on the nerve. In neurapraxia, stimulation to the injured nerve results in a greater reduction in the action potential amplitude on the proximal site of the injury as opposed to the distal site. \\n\\nNeurapraxia occurs in the peripheral nervous system typically in the ulnar, median, and radial nerves of the upper body and in the sciatic and peroneal nerves of the lower body. Peripheral nerves are myelinated, relatively large, spatially complex cells whose size and connectivity typically make them more susceptible to damage and compromise their capacity to self-repair, although this is not the case in neurapraxia. Microscopic evidence has shown that there is damage to the myelin sheath, but not to the axon. Therefore, distal nerve fibers do not degenerate and the myelin damage can be repaired. \\n\\nThe order of pathology within the first 24 hours after injury follows a general pattern of nerve injury. The first physical manifestation of the injury is focal swelling adjacent to the site of the injury. In the cellular dimension, a fragmentation of neurotubules and neurofilaments occurs as a result of pressure exerted on the nerve. \\n\\nThere are several mechanisms of nerve injury including mechanical lesions, ischemia, immunologic attack, metabolic disorder, toxic agents, and exposure to radiation. The most common mechanism of injury is nerve compression in which external pressure causes decreased blood flow to the nerve and deformation of the nerve fibers. \\n\\nThere are three distinct classifications and degrees of nerve injury: \\n\\nNeurotmesis is the most serious degree of nerve injury. It involves the disruption of the nerve and the nerve sheath. \\n\\nAxonotmesis occurs when the majority of the supporting structures of the nerve are preserved, but disruption of the nerve fibers is still observed. Wallerian degeneration often occurs in the near the proximity of the injury site. \\n\\nNeurapraxia is least serious form of nerve injury. \\n\\nThere are two different forms of mechanical nerve injury involving neurapraxia. The underlying causes of transient nerve injury typically include a brief ischemic episode or any form of compression. Diagnosis of neurapraxia is almost always followed by a quick and complete recovery period. \\n\\nThe entire nerve is involved in the response to traumatic injuries. \\n\\nNeurapraxia is often treated and cured by non-operative means. The primary goals of treatment are to maintain the proper nutrition of the paralyzed muscles, prevent contraction by the antagonists of the paralyzed muscles, and to consistently keep the joints mobile. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can also help to reduce swelling at the injury site. In addition to these non-operative remedies, it is suggested that muscles affected by neurapraxia be kept warm at all times. Circulation in the limb is stimulated with the use of heat. \\n\\nOnce voluntary movement has returned to the muscle, recovery and treatment continues by the participation in active exercises. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy are common sources of treatment during these early stages of restoration of active movement. Almost all cases of neurapraxia can be completely treated by non-operative means. \\n\\nAccording to medical professionals with the Cleveland Clinic, once an athlete suffers from an episode of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia, team physician or athletic trainer first stabilize the head and neck followed by a thorough neurologic inspection. If the injury is deemed severe, injured parties should be taken to a hospital for evaluation. Athletes that suffer from severe episodes of neurapraxia are urged to consult orthopaedic or spinal medical specialists. In mild cases of neurapraxia, the athlete is able to remove themselves from the field of play. However, the athlete is still advised to seek medical consultation. \\n\\nIn cases of neurapraxia, the function of the nerves are temporarily impaired. However, the prognosis for recovery from neurapraxia is efficient and quick. Recovery begins within two to three weeks after the injury occurs, and it is complete within six to eight weeks. There are instances when function is not completely restored until four months after the instance of injury. The recovery period of neurapraxia is not an entirely ordered process, but the recovery is always complete and fast. \\n\\nNeurapraxia is most commonly observed in athletes involved in collision sports, such as American football. Athletes participating in collision sports most often suffer from cervical cord neurapraxia, also known as transient neurapraxia. Cervical cord neurapraxia is the result of a severe collision in which a blow to the crown of the athlete’s head forcefully extends or compresses the neck. Numbness, stinging, and/or weakness in the arms, legs or both, distinguish cervical cord neurapraxia. Typical episodes of transient nuerapraxia only last a few seconds and symptoms dissipate entirely. \\n\\nCervical cord neurapraxia among American football players is commonly observed in athletes playing positions involving high-speed collisions and open-field tackling. Cases of neurapraxia in the National Football League were first described in 1986 by Joseph S. Torg, M.D., founder of the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry (established in 1975). As a result of Dr. Torg’s findings the NFL as well as other levels of American football have outlawed the act of spearing, or the lowering of the head and hitting an opponent with the crown of the helmet. The cervical spine cannot properly absorb the force of a collision when the head is even slightly lowered as is the case in spearing. In addition to outlawing acts such as spearing, prevention of neurapraxia on the football field relies on instruction and reinforcement of proper tackling technique by coaches and trainers. \\n\\nIn MASH Season 4 Episode one, Hawkeye Pierce claims that Radar O\\'Reilly has Neurapraxia as an excuse for driving passed a military checkpoint. Hawkeye lies about the causes and treatments to keep them from getting into trouble. When questioned by Radar he asked him if it was a real disease to which he answered \" Yes but you can only get it by biting your nails \" which Radar was about to do. \\n\\nAxonotmesis \\n\\nNeurotmesis \\n\\nNerve injury \\n\\nPeripheral nerve injury \\n\\nNeuroregeneration \\n\\nWallerian degeneration \\n\\nSeddon\\'s classification \\n\\n',\n",

       "  {'title': 'Adverse drug reaction',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': 'An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an injury caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of \" side effect \" , as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance. An adverse drug event (ADE) refers to any injury occurring at the time a drug is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the injury. An ADR is a special type of ADE in which a causative relationship can be shown. ADRs are only one type of medication-related harm, as harm can also be caused by omitting to take indicated medications. \\n\\nADRs may be classified by e.g. cause and severity. \\n\\nType A: Augmented pharmacologic effects - dose dependent and predictable \\n\\n:Type A reactions, which constitute approximately 80% of adverse drug reactions, are usually a consequence of the drug’s primary pharmacological effect (e.g. bleeding when using the anticoagulant warfarin) or a low therapeutic index of the drug (e.g. nausea from digoxin), and they are therefore predictable. They are dose-related and usually mild, although they may be serious or even fatal (e.g. intracranial bleeding from warfarin). Such reactions are usually due to inappropriate dosage, especially when drug elimination is impaired. The term ‘side effects’ is often applied to minor type A reactions. \\n\\nType B: Idiosyncratic \\n\\nTypes A and B were proposed in the 1970s, and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs. \\n\\nThe U.S Food and Drug Administration defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following: \\n\\nDeath \\n\\nLife-threatening \\n\\nHospitalization (initial or prolonged) \\n\\nDisability - significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient\\'s body function/structure, physical activities or quality of life. \\n\\nCongenital abnormality \\n\\nRequires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage \\n\\nSeverity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question. The terms \" severe \" and \" serious \" when applied to adverse events are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage. \\n\\nA headache is severe, if it causes intense pain. There are scales like \" visual analog scale \" that help clinicians assess the severity. On the other hand, a headache is not usually serious (but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural bleed, even a migraine may temporally fit criteria), unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above. \\n\\nAdverse effects may be local, i.e. limited to a certain location, or systemic, where medication has caused adverse effects throughout the systemic circulation. \\n\\nFor instance, some ocular antihypertensives cause systemic effects, although they are administered locally as eye drops, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation. \\n\\nAs research better explains the biochemistry of drug use, fewer ADRs are Type B and more are Type A. Common mechanisms are: \\n\\nAbnormal pharmacokinetics due to \\n\\ngenetic factors \\n\\ncomorbid disease states \\n\\nSynergistic effects between either \\n\\na drug and a disease \\n\\ntwo drugs \\n\\nVarious diseases, especially those that cause renal or hepatic insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug\\'s metabolism due to disease states. \\n\\nThe Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D) criteria warns that people with dementia are more likely to experience adverse effects, and that they are less likely to be able to reliably report symptoms. \\n\\nAbnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the inherited basis for abnormal drug reactions. \\n\\nInheriting abnormal alleles of cytochrome P450 can alter drug metabolism. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. \\n\\nInheriting abnormal butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) may affect metabolism of drugs such as succinylcholine \\n\\nInheriting abnormal N-acetyltransferase which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide. \\n\\nInheriting abnormal thiopurine S-methyltransferase may affect the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and azathioprine. \\n\\nThe risk of drug interactions is increased with polypharmacy. \\n\\nThese interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved. These are mainly for drugs without much first-pass liver metabolism. The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are: \\n\\nalbumin \\n\\nα1-acid glycoprotein \\n\\nlipoproteins \\n\\nSome drug interactions with warfarin are due to changes in protein binding. \\n\\nPatients have abnormal metabolism by cytochrome P450 due to either inheriting abnormal alleles or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions. \\n\\nAn example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the QT interval. \\n\\nCausality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the Naranjo algorithm, the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply. \\n\\nAn ADR should not be labeled as \\'certain\\' unless the ADR abates with a challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR. \\n\\nAssigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population. \\n\\nMany countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the WHO runs the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and the European Union runs the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies. \\n\\nIn Canada, the Marketed Health Products Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the surveillance of marketed health products. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) conducts postmarket monitoring of therapeutic products. In the UK the Yellow Card Scheme was established in 1963. \\n\\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source for adverse drug events seen in the hospital setting. Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug. A second study by AHRQ found that in 2011, the most common specifically identified causes of adverse drug events that originated during hospital stays in the U.S. were steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants. Patients treated in urban teaching hospitals had higher rates of ADEs involving antibiotics and opiates/narcotics compared to those treated in urban nonteaching hospitals. Those treated in private, nonprofit hospitals had higher rates of most ADE causes compared to patients treated in public or private, for-profit hospitals. \\n\\nIn the U.S., females had a higher rate of ADEs involving opiates and narcotics than males in 2011, while male patients had a higher rate of anticoagulant ADEs. Nearly 8 in 1,000 adults aged 65 years or older experienced one of the four most common ADEs (steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants) during hospitalization. \\n\\nIn 2012 McKinsey & Co. concluded that the cost of the 35 million preventable adverse drug events would be as high as US$115 billion. \\n\\nAlleged problems in the drug approval process \\n\\nClassification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals \\n\\nDrug therapy problems \\n\\nEudraVigilance (European Union) \\n\\nHistory of pharmacy \\n\\nIatrogenesis \\n\\nLethal dose \\n\\nList of withdrawn drugs \\n\\nParadoxical reaction \\n\\nPolypharmacy \\n\\nToxicity \\n\\nToxicology \\n\\nThe Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics \\n\\nYellow Card Scheme (UK) \\n\\nIncidence of adverse drug reactions in human immune deficiency virus-positive patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'A limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the gait. Limping may be caused by pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. The most common underlying cause of a painful limp is physical trauma; however, in the absence of trauma, other serious causes, such as septic arthritis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis, may be present. The diagnostic approach involves ruling out potentially serious causes via the use of X-rays, blood tests, and sometimes joint aspiration. Initial treatment involves pain management. A limp is the presenting problem in about 4% of children who visit hospital emergency departments. \\n\\nA limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the gait. When due to pain it is referred to as an antalgic gait, in which the foot is in contact with the ground for a shorter duration than usual; in severe cases there may be a refusal to walk. \\n\\nThe causes of limping are many and can be either serious or non-serious. It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations. Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children. \\n\\nSeptic arthritis can be difficult to separate from less serious conditions such as transient synovitis. Factors that can help indicate septic arthritis rather than synovitis include a WBC count greater than 12×10 \\n\\nOther infections that classically lead to a limp include Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by a deer tick) and osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone). \\n\\nAccidental or deliberate physical trauma may result in either a fracture, muscle bruising, or a contusion. Deliberate abuse is important to consider. \\n\\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a condition in which the growth plate of the head of the femur slips over the underlying bone. It most commonly presents with hip pain in males during puberty and is associated with obesity. Treatment involves non-weight-bearing movement and surgery. \\n\\nA non-painful limp may be due to a number of mechanical conditions including hip dysplasia and leg length differences. \\n\\nTransient synovitis is a reactive arthritis of the hip of unknown cause. \\n\\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis presents gradually with early morning stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss. \\n\\nLegg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome is a degenerative disease of the head of the femur which results in bone loss and deformity. It usually presents as a chronic condition. \\n\\nCancers including acute lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Ewing’s sarcoma may result in a gradual onset of limping in children. It is often associated with night sweating, easy bruising, weight loss, and pain most prominent at night. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of the cause of a limp is often made based on history, physical exam findings, laboratory tests, and radiological examination. If a limp is associated with pain it should be urgently investigated, while non-painful limps can be approached and investigated more gradually. Young children have difficulty determining the location of leg pain, thus in this population, knee pain equals hip pain. \\n\\nA limp at one hospital emergency department was the presenting complaint in 4% of children. \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a medical condition in which there are anatomic changes and a loss of function of varying degrees of one or more intervertebral discs of the spine of sufficient magnitude as to cause symptoms. Spine. 39(24):page 2538, NOV 2014 DOI:BRS.0b013e3182a8866d, , Issn Print: 0362-2436 Publication Date: 2014/11/15 Lumbar Disc Nomenclature: Version 2.0 \\n\\nDavid F. Fardon; Alan L. Williams; Edward J. Dohring; F. Reed Murtagh; Stephen L. Gabriel Rothman; Gordon K. Sze The root cause is thought to be loss of soluble proteins within the fluid contained in the disc with resultant reduction of the oncotic pressure, which in turn causes loss of fluid volume. Normal downward forces cause the affected disc to lose height, and the distance between vertebrae is reduced. The anulus fibrosus, the rigid outer shell of a disc, also weakens. This loss of height causes laxity of the longitudinal ligaments, which may allow anterior, posterior, or lateral shifting of the vertebral bodies, causing facet joint malalignment and arthritis; scoliosis; cervical hyperlordosis; thoracic hyperkyphosis; lumbar hyperlordosis; narrowing of the space available for the spinal tract within the vertebra (spinal stenosis); or narrowing of the space through which a spinal nerve exits (vertebral foramen stenosis) with resultant inflammation and impingement of a spinal nerve, causing a radiculopathy. \\n\\nDDD can cause mild to severe pain, either acute or chronic, near the involved disc, as well as neuropathic pain if an adjacent spinal nerve root is involved. Diagnosis is suspected when typical symptoms and physical findings are present; and confirmed by x-rays of the vertebral column. Occasionally the radiologic diagnosis of disc degeneration is made incidentally when a cervical x-ray, chest x-ray, or abdominal x-ray is taken for other reasons, and the abnormalities of the vertebral column are recognized. The diagnosis of DDD is not a radiologic diagnosis, since the interpreting radiologist is not aware whether there are symptoms present or not. Typical radiographic findings include disc space narrowing, displacement of vertebral bodies, fusion of adjacent vertebral bodies, and development of bone in adjacent soft tissue (osteophyte formation). An MRI is typically reserved for those with symptoms, signs, and x-ray findings suggesting the need for surgical intervention. \\n\\nTreatment may include physical therapy to reduce pain and increase any reduced range of motion of the spine; strength training with emphasis on correcting abnormal posture, assisting the paravertebral (paraspinous) muscles in stabilizing the spine, and core muscle strengthening; stretching exercises; massage therapy; oral analgesia with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS); and topical analgesia with lidocaine, ice and heat. Immediate surgery may be indicated if the symptoms are severe or sudden in onset, or there is a sudden worsening of symptoms. Elective surgery may be indicated after six months of conservative therapy with unsatisfactory relief of symptoms. \\n\\nDegenerative disc disease can result in lower back or upper neck pain. The amount of degeneration does not correlate well with the amount of pain patients experience. Many people experience no pain while others, with exactly the same amount of damage have severe, chronic pain. Whether a patient experiences pain or not largely depends on the location of the affected disc and the amount of pressure that is being put on the spinal column and surrounding nerve roots. \\n\\nNevertheless, degenerative disc disease is one of the most common sources of back pain and affects approximately 30 million people every year. With symptomatic degenerative disc disease, the pain can vary depending on the location of the affected disc. A degenerated disc in the lower back can result in lower back pain, sometimes radiating to the hips, as well as pain in the buttocks, thighs or legs. If pressure is being placed on the nerves by exposed nucleus pulposus, sporadic tingling or weakness through the knees and legs can also occur. \\n\\nA degenerated disc in the upper neck will often result in pain to the neck, arm, shoulders and hands; tingling in the fingers may also be evident if nerve impingement is occurring. \\n\\nPain is most commonly felt or worsened by movements such as sitting, bending, lifting and twisting. \\n\\nAfter an injury, some discs become painful because of inflammation and the pain comes and goes. Some people have nerve endings that penetrate more deeply into the anulus fibrosus (outer layer of the disc) than others, making discs more likely to generate pain. In the alternative, the healing of trauma to the outer anulus fibrosus may result in the innervation of the scar tissue and pain impulses from the disc, as these nerves become inflamed by nucleus pulposus material. Degenerative disc disease can lead to a chronic debilitating condition and can have a serious negative impact on a person\\'s quality of life. When pain from degenerative disc disease is severe, traditional nonoperative treatment may be ineffective. \\n\\nThere is a disc between each of the vertebrae in the spine. A healthy, well-hydrated disc will contain a great deal of water in its center, known as the nucleus pulposus, which provides cushioning and flexibility for the spine. Much of the mechanical stress that is caused by everyday movements is transferred to the discs within the spine and the water content within them allows them to effectively absorb the shock. At birth, a typical human nucleus pulposus will contain about 80% water. However natural daily stresses and minor injuries can cause these discs to gradually lose water as the anulus fibrosus, or the rigid outer shell of a disc, weakens. Because degenerative disc disease is largely due to natural daily stresses, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists have suggested it is not truly a \" disease \" process. \\n\\nThis water loss makes the discs less flexible and results in the gradual collapse and narrowing of the gap in the spinal column. As the space between vertebrae gets smaller, extra pressure can be placed on the discs causing tiny cracks or tears to appear in the anulus. If enough pressure is exerted, it is possible for the nucleus pulposus material to seep out through the tears in the anulus and can cause what is known as a herniated disc. \\n\\nAs the two vertebrae above and below the affected disc begin to collapse upon each other, the facet joints at the back of the spine are forced to shift which can affect their function. \\n\\nAdditionally, the body can react to the closing gap between vertebrae by creating bone spurs around the disc space in an attempt to stop excess motion. This can cause issues if the bone spurs start to grow into the spinal canal and put pressure on the spinal cord and surrounding nerve roots as it can cause pain and affect nerve function. This condition is called spinal stenosis. \\n\\nFor women, there is evidence that menopause and related estrogen-loss are associated with lumbar disc degeneration, usually occurring during the first 15 years of the climacteric. The potential role of sex hormones in the etiology of degenerative skeletal disorders is being discussed for both genders. \\n\\nDegenerative discs typically show degenerative fibrocartilage and clusters of chondrocytes, suggestive of repair. Inflammation may or may not be present. Histologic examination of disc fragments resected for presumed DDD is routine to exclude malignancy. \\n\\nFibrocartilage replaces the gelatinous mucoid material of the nucleus pulposus as the disc changes with age. There may be splits in the anulus fibrosus, permitting herniation of elements of nucleus pulposus. There may also be shrinkage of the nucleus pulposus that produces prolapse or folding of the anulus fibrosus with secondary osteophyte formation at the margins of the adjacent vertebral body. The pathologic findings in DDD include protrusion, spondylolysis, and subluxation of vertebrae (spondylolisthesis) and spinal stenosis. It has been hypothesized that Cutibacterium acnes may play a role. \\n\\nDiagnosis of degenerative disc disease will usually consist of an analysis of a patient\\'s individual medical history, a physical exam designed to reveal muscle weakness, tenderness or poor range of motion, and an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes. \\n\\nOften, degenerative disc disease can be successfully treated without surgery. One or a combination of treatments such as physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, traction, or epidural steroid injection often provide adequate relief of troubling symptoms. \\n\\nSurgery may be recommended if the conservative treatment options do not provide relief within two to three months. If leg or back pain limits normal activity, if there is weakness or numbness in the legs, if it is difficult to walk or stand, or if medication or physical therapy are ineffective, surgery may be necessary, most often spinal fusion. There are many surgical options for the treatment of degenerative disc disease, including anterior and posterior approaches. The most common surgical treatments include: \\n\\nTraditional approaches in treating patients with DDD-resultant herniated discs oftentimes include discectomy — which, in essence, is a spine-related surgical procedure involving the removal of damaged intervertebral discs (either whole removal, or partially-based). The former of these two discectomy techniques involved in open discectomy is known as Subtotal Discectomy (SD; or, aggressive discectomy) and the latter, Limited Discectomy (LD; or, conservative discectomy). However, with either technique, the probability of post-operative reherniation exists and at a considerably high maximum of 21%, prompting patients to potentially undergo recurrent disk surgery. \\n\\nNew treatments are emerging that are still in the beginning clinical trial phases. Glucosamine injections may offer pain relief for some without precluding the use of more aggressive treatment options. In the US, artificial disc replacement is viewed cautiously as a possible alternative to fusion in carefully selected patients, yet it is widely used in a broader range of cases in Europe, where multi-level disc replacement of the cervical and lumbar spine is common. Adult stem cell or cell transplantation therapies for disc regeneration are in their infancy of development, but initial clinical trials have shown cell transplantation to be safe and initial observations suggest some beneficial effects for associated pain and disability. An optimal cell type, transplantation method, cell density, carrier, or patient indication remains to be determined. Investigation into mesenchymal stem cell therapy knife-less fusion of vertebrae in the United States began in 2006 and a DiscGenics nucleus pulposus progenitor cell transplantation clinical trial has started as of 2018 in the USA and Japan. \\n\\nResearchers and surgeons have conducted clinical and basic science studies to uncover the regenerative capacity possessed by the large animal species involved (humans and quadrupeds) for potential therapies to treat the disease. Some therapies, carried out by research laboratories in New York, include introduction of biologically-engineered, injectable riboflavin cross-linked high density collagen (HDC-laden) gels into disease spinal segments to induce regeneration, ultimately restoring functionality and structure to the two main inner and outer components of vertebral discs — anulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus. \\n\\nDegenerative disc disease can occur in other mammals besides humans. It is a common problem in several dog breeds, and attempts to remove this disease from dog populations have led to several hybrid breeds, such as the Chiweenie. \\n\\nFailed back syndrome \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Failure to thrive (FTT) indicates insufficient weight gain or inappropriate weight loss in pediatric patients unless the term is more precisely defined. \\n\\nThe term \" failure to thrive \" has been used vaguely and in different contexts to refer to different issues in pediatric growth. It is most commonly used to describe a failure to gain weight, but some providers have also used it to describe a failure to grow, or a failure to grow and to gain weight. and different objective standards have been defined. FTT is suggested by a fall in one or more weight centile spaces on a World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart depending on birth weight or when weight is below the 2nd percentile of weight for age irrespective of birth weight. In children whose birth weight was between the 9th and 91st percentile FTT is indicated by a drop across 2 or more centile spaces. Failure to thrive is not a disease, but a sign of inadequate nutrition. \\n\\nIn veterinary medicine it is also referred to as ill-thrift. \\n\\nFailure to thrive occurs in children whose nutritional intake is insufficient for supporting normal growth and weight gain. Failure to thrive typically presents before two years of age, when growth rates are highest. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has also been associated with FTT, and can present with characteristic findings including microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum and a thin vermillion border. Malabsorption, due to disorders like Crohn\\'s disease and cystic fibrosis, can present with abdominal distention and hyperactive bowel sounds. A decrease in length with a proportional drop in weight can be related to long-standing nutritional factors as well as genetic or endocrine causes. \\n\\nTraditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into endogenous and exogenous causes. These causes can be largely grouped into three categories: inadequate caloric intake, malabsorption/caloric retention defect, and increased metabolic demands. Initial investigation should consider prenatal history, postnatal history, past medical history, feeding history to assess overall caloric intake, developmental history, family history, and psychosocial history. \\n\\n; Endogenous (or \" organic \" ):Causes are due to physical or mental issues with the child itself. It can include various inborn errors of metabolism. Problems with the gastrointestinal system such as excessive gas and acid reflux are painful conditions which may make the child unwilling to take in sufficient nutrition. \\n\\n; Exogenous (or \" nonorganic \" ): Caused by caregiver\\'s actions. Examples include physical inability to produce enough breastmilk, A recent study on toddlers with exogenous FTT has found preliminary evidence suggesting that difficulty experienced during feeding times with this condition may in fact be impacted by preexisting sensory processing problems. In developing countries, conflict settings and protracted emergencies, exogenous faltering may be caused by chronic food insecurity, lack of nutritional awareness, and other factors beyond the caregiver\\'s control. As many as 90% of failure to thrive cases are non-organic. \\n\\n; Mixed: However, to think of the terms as dichotomous can be misleading, since both endogenous and exogenous factors may co-exist. \\n\\nPoverty/inadequate food supply – number one risk factor for failure to thrive globally \\n\\nImproper mixing of formula \\n\\nPostpartum depression/maternal depression – studies have shown that mothers with postpartum depression are at increased risk for experiencing breastfeeding difficulties \\n\\nChild neglect – prevalence of neglect in non-organic failure to thrive is estimated to be as high as 5–10% \\n\\nCleft lip and cleft palate – impaired oral motor coordination/poor suck \\n\\nCerebral palsy/hypotonia \\n\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease – symptoms of irritability, fussiness, and spitting up that occur shortly after feeding. Typically resolves by 1–2 years of age. \\n\\nMalrotation \\n\\nPyloric stenosis - Most commonly presents at 1–2 months of age with forceful, projectile vomiting immediately after feeds. More common in first-born males, \\n\\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) \\n\\nLactose intolerance/cow\\'s milk protein allergy – affects 2–3% of infants during the first year of life \\n\\nCoeliac disease \\n\\nShort bowel syndrome – necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause. \\n\\nCystic fibrosis \\n\\nBiliary atresia \\n\\nHyperthyroidism \\n\\nChronic infections – tuberculosis, HIV \\n\\nTORCH infections – toxoplasmosis, other (syphilis, varicella zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes \\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease \\n\\nDiabetes mellitus \\n\\nCongenital heart defects \\n\\nChronic lung disease – bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchiectasis \\n\\nInborn errors of metabolism – galactosemia, glycogen storage diseases \\n\\nFTT may be evaluated through a multifaceted process, beginning with a patient history that notably includes diet history, which is a key element for identifying potential causes of FTT. Next, a complete physical examination may be done, with special attention being paid to identifying possible organic sources of FTT. If indicated, anti-TTG IgA antibodies can be used to assess for Celiac\\'s disease, and a sweat chloride test is used to screen for cystic fibrosis. \\n\\nInfants and children who have had unpleasant eating experiences (e.g. acid reflux or food intolerance) may be reluctant to eat their meals. Special care should be taken to avoid refeeding syndrome when initiating feeds in a malnourished patient. Refeeding syndrome is caused by a shift in fluid and electrolytes in a malnourished person as they receive artificial refeeding. It is potentially fatal, and can occur whether receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The most serious and common electrolyte abnormality is hypophosphatemia, although sodium abnormalities are common as well. It can also cause changes in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism. Incidence of refeeding syndrome is high, with one prospective cohort study showing 34% of ICU experienced hypophosphatemia soon after feeding was restarted. \\n\\nChildren with failure to thrive are at an increased risk for long-term growth, cognitive, and behavioral complications. Early intervention and restoration of adequate nutrition has been shown to reduce the likelihood of long-term sequelae, however, studies have shown that failure to thrive may cause persistent behavioral problems, despite appropriate treatment. \\n\\nFailure to thrive is a common presenting problem in the pediatric population. Failure to thrive is very prevalent in the United States, representing 5–10% of children seen as outpatients by primary care physicians. Failure to thrive is more prevalent in children of lower socioeconomic status and is associated with lower parental education levels. Retrospective studies suggest that males are slightly more likely than females to be admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive (53.2% vs. 46.7%). \\n\\nFTT was first introduced in the early 20th century to describe poor growth in orphan children but became associated with negative implications (such as maternal deprivation) that often incorrectly explained the underlying issues. Throughout the 20th century, FTT was expanded to include many different issues related to poor growth, which made it broadly applicable but non-specific. \\n\\nHospitalism \\n\\nStunted growth \\n\\nSmall for gestational age \\n\\nMalnutrition \\n\\nRefeeding syndrome \\n\\nDevelopmental disorders \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'Isovaleric acidemia is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder which disrupts or prevents normal metabolism of the branched-chain amino acid leucine. It is a classical type of organic acidemia. \\n\\nA characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet. This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals. \\n\\nIn about half of cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma. These medical problems are typically severe and can be life-threatening. In the other half of cases, the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time. They are often triggered by an infection or by eating an increased amount of protein-rich foods. \\n\\nThe disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. \\n\\nMutations in both copies of the IVD gene result in isovaleric acidemia. \\n\\nThe enzyme encoded by IVD, isovaleric acid-CoA dehydrogenase (), plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for the third step in processing leucine, an essential amino acid. If a mutation in the IVD gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. As a result, isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to toxic levels, damaging the brain and nervous system. \\n\\nThe urine of newborns can be screened for isovaleric acidemia using mass spectrometry, allowing for early diagnosis. Elevations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma are found. \\n\\nOn 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including isovaleric acidemia. \\n\\nTreatment consists of dietary protein restriction, particularly leucine. During acute episodes, glycine is sometimes given, which conjugates with isovalerate forming isovalerylglycine, or carnitine which has a similar effect. \\n\\nElevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is a clinical biomarker of biotin deficiency. Without biotin, leucine and isoleucine cannot be metabolized normally and results in elevated synthesis of isovaleric acid and consequently 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylglycine, and other isovaleric acid metabolites as well. Elevated serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentrations can be caused by supplementation with 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, genetic conditions, or dietary deficiency of biotin. Some patients with isovaleric acidemia may benefit from supplemental biotin. Biotin deficiency on its own can have severe physiological and cognitive consequences that closely resemble symptoms of organic acidemias. \\n\\nA 2011 review of 176 cases found that diagnoses made early in life (within a few days of birth) were associated with more severe disease and a mortality of 33%. Children diagnosed later, and who had milder symptoms, showed a lower mortality rate of ~3%. \\n\\nIsovaleric acidemia is estimated to affect at least 1 in 250,000 births in the United States. \\n\\nMaple syrup urine disease \\n\\nMethylmalonic acidemia \\n\\nPropionic acidemia \\n\\n& part=oa-overview GeneReviews: The Organic Acidemias',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': \"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting branched-chain amino acids. It is one type of organic acidemia. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine, particularly prior to diagnosis, and during times of acute illness. \\n\\nMaple syrup urine disease can be classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms, or by its genetic cause. The most common and severe form of this disease is the classic type, which appears soon after birth, and as long as it remains untreated, gives rise to progressive and unremitting symptoms. Variant forms of the disorder may become apparent only later in infancy or childhood, with typically less severe symptoms that may only appear during times of fasting, stress or illness, but still involve mental and physical problems if left untreated. \\n\\nSub-divisions of MSUD: \\n\\n#Classic MSUD \\n\\n#Intermediate MSUD \\n\\n#Intermittent MSUD \\n\\n#Thiamine-responsive MSUD \\n\\nGenerally, majority of patients will be classified into one of these four categories but some patients affected by MSUD do not fit the criteria for the listed sub-divisions and will be deemed unclassified MSUD. \\n\\nThe disease is named for the presence of sweet-smelling urine, similar to maple syrup, when the person goes into metabolic crisis. Along with the smell being present in ear wax of an affected individual during metabolic crisis. In populations to whom maple syrup is unfamiliar, the aroma can be likened to fenugreek, and fenugreek ingestion may impart the aroma to urine. \\n\\nSymptoms of MSUD varies between patients and is greatly related to the amount of residual enzyme activity. \\n\\nInfants with classic MSUD will display subtle symptoms within 2-3 days. Subtle symptoms include poor feeding, either bottle or breast, lethargy, and irritability. The infant will then experience increased focal neurologic signs. These neurologic signs include athetoid, hypertonia, spasticity, and opisthotonus that lead to convulsions and coma. If MSUD is left untreated, central neurologic function and respiratory failure will occur and lead to death. \\n\\nAlthough MSUD can be stabilized, there are still threats of metabolic decompensation and loss bone mass that can lead to osteoporosis, pancreatitis, and intracranial hypertension. Other signs and symptoms associated with classic MSUD include intellectual limitation and behavioral issues. \\n\\nIntermediate MSUD has greater levels of residual enzyme activity than classic MSUD. Majority of children with intermediate MSUD are diagnosed between the ages of 5 months and 7 years. Symptoms associated with classic MSUD also appear in intermediate MSUD. \\n\\nContrary to classic and intermediate MSUD, intermittent MSUD individuals will have normal growth and intellectual development. Symptoms of lethargy and characterized odor of maple syrup will occur when the individual experiences stress, does not eat, or develops an infection. Metabolic crisis leading to seizures, coma, and brain damage is still a possibility. \\n\\nSymptoms associated with thiamine-response MSUD are similar to intermediate MSUD. Newborns rarely present with symptoms. \\n\\nThe symptoms of MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, rapid neurological decline, and coma. Additionally, MSUD patients experience an abnormal course of diseases in simple infections that can lead to permanent damage. \\n\\nMutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease: \\n\\nBCKDHA () \\n\\nBCKDHB () \\n\\nDBT () \\n\\nDLD () \\n\\nThese four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are present in some quantity in almost all kinds of food, but in particular, protein-rich foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, whole grains, seeds, avocados, algae, edible seaweed, beans, and pulses. Mutation in any of these genes reduces or eliminates the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. \\n\\nThis condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene – one from each parent – must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. \\n\\nMSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKAD), leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine.The build up of these BCAAS will lead to the maple syrup odor that is associated with MSUD. The BCKAD complex begins by breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine through the use of branch-chain aminotransferase into their relevant α-ketoacids. The second step involves the conversion of α-ketoacids into acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, and succunyl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoacids. The BCKAD complex consists of four subunits designated E . Mutations of these enzyme subunits will lead to the BCKAD complex unable to break down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The levels of these branched chain amino acids will become elevated and lead to the symptoms associated with MSUD. Glutamate levels are maintained in the brain by BCAA metabolism functions and if not properly maintained can lead to neurological problems that are seen in MSUD individuals. High levels of leucine has also been shown to affect water homeostasis within subcortical gray matter leading to cerebral edema, which occurs is MSUD patients if left untreated. \\n\\nPrior to the easy availability of plasma amino acid measurement, diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor. Affected individuals are now often identified with characteristic elevations on plasma amino acids which do not have the characteristic odor. \\n\\nOn 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including maple syrup urine disease. \\n\\nNewborn screening for maple syrup urine disease involves analyzing the blood of 1–2 day-old newborns through tandem mass spectrometry. The blood concentration of leucine and isoleucine is measured relative to other amino acids to determine if the newborn has a high level of branched-chain amino acids. Once the newborn is 2–3 days old the blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids like leucine is greater than 1000 µmol/L and alternative screening methods are used. Instead, the newborn’s urine is analyzed for levels of branched-chain alpha-hydroxyacids and alpha-ketoacids. \\n\\nThe amount and type of enzyme activity in an affected individual with MSUD will determine which classification the affected individual will identify with. \\n\\nClassic MSUD: Less than 2% of normal enzyme activity \\n\\nIntermediate MSUD: 3-8% normal enzyme activity \\n\\nIntermittent MSUD: 8-15% of normal enzyme activity \\n\\nThiamine-Responsive MSUD: Large doses of thiamine will increase enzyme activity. \\n\\nThere are no methods for preventing the manifestation of the pathology of MSUD in infants with two defective copies of the BCKD gene. However, genetic counselors may consult with couples to screen for the disease via DNA testing. DNA testing is also available to identify the disease in an unborn child in the womb. \\n\\nKeeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of blood chemistry, both at home and in a hospital setting. DNPH or specialised dipsticks may be used to test the patient's urine for ketones (a sign of metabolic decompensation), when metabolic stress is likely or suspected. Fingerstick tests are performed regularly and sent to a laboratory to determine blood levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Regular metabolic consultations, including blood-draws for full nutritional analysis, are recommended; especially during puberty and periods of rapid growth. MSUD management also involves a specially tailored metabolic formula, a modified diet, and lifestyle precautions such as avoiding fatigue and infections, as well as consuming regular, sufficient calories in proportion to physical stress and exertion. Without sufficient calories, catabolism of muscle protein will result in metabolic crisis. Those with MSUD must be hospitalised for intravenous infusion of sugars and nasogastric drip-feeding of formula, in the event of metabolic decompensation, or lack of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting. Food avoidance, rejection of formula and picky eating are all common problems with MSUD. Some patients may need to receive all or part of their daily nutrition through a feeding tube. \\n\\nA diet with carefully controlled levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine must be maintained at all times in order to prevent neurological damage. Since these three amino acids occur in all natural protein, and most natural foods contain some protein, any food intake must be closely monitored, and day-to-day protein intake calculated on a cumulative basis, to ensure individual tolerance levels are not exceeded at any time. As the MSUD diet is so protein-restricted, and adequate protein is a requirement for all humans, tailored metabolic formula containing all the other essential amino acids, as well as any vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and trace elements (which may be lacking due to the limited range of permissible foods), are an essential aspect of MSUD management. These complement the MSUD patient's natural food intake to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm. If adequate calories cannot be obtained from natural food without exceeding protein tolerance, specialised low protein products such as starch-based baking mixtures, imitation rice and pasta may be prescribed, often alongside a protein-free carbohydrate powder added to food and/or drink, and increased at times of metabolic stress. MSUD patients with thiamine- responsive MSUD can have a higher protein intake diet with administration of high doses of thiamine, a cofactor of the enzyme that causes the condition. The typical dosage amount of thiamine-responsive MSUD depends on the enzyme activity present and can range from 10mg - 100mg daily. \\n\\nUsually MSUD patients are monitored by a dietitian. Liver transplantation is another treatment option that can completely and permanently normalise metabolic function, enabling discontinuation of nutritional supplements and strict monitoring of biochemistry and caloric intake, relaxation of MSUD-related lifestyle precautions, and an unrestricted diet. This procedure is most successful when performed at a young age, and weaning from immunosuppressants may even be possible in the long run. However, the surgery is a major undertaking requiring extensive hospitalisation and rigorous adherence to a tapering regimen of medications. Following transplant, the risk of periodic rejection will always exist, as will the need for some degree of lifelong monitoring in this respect. Despite normalising clinical presentation, liver transplantation is not considered a cure for MSUD. The patient will still carry two copies of the mutated BKAD gene in each of their own cells, which will consequently still be unable to produce the missing enzyme. They will also still pass one mutated copy of the gene on to each of their biological children. As a major surgery the transplant procedure itself also carries standard risks, although the odds of its success are greatly elevated when the only indication for it is an inborn error of metabolism. In absence of a liver transplant, the MSUD diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently. However, in both treatment scenarios, with proper management, those afflicted are able to live healthy, normal lives without suffering the severe neurological damage associated with the disease. \\n\\nControl of metabolism is vital during pregnancy of women with MSUD. To prevent detrimental abnormalities in development of the embryo or fetus, dietary adjustments should be made and plasma amino acid concentrations of the mother should be observed carefully and frequently. Amino acid deficiency can be detected through fetal growth, making it essential to monitor development closely. \\n\\nIf left untreated, MSUD will lead to death due to central neurological function failure and respiratory failure. Early detection, diet low in branched-chain amino acids, and close monitoring of blood chemistry can lead to a good prognosis with little or no abnormal developments. Even with proper treatment, metabolic crisis is still likely to occur and can lead to death without immediate medical treatment. \\n\\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Its prevalence in the United States population is approximately 1 newborn out of 180,000 live births. However, in populations where there is a higher frequency of consanguinity, such as the Mennonites in Pennsylvania or the Amish, the frequency of MSUD is significantly higher at 1 newborn out of 176 live births. In Austria, 1 newborn out of 250,000 live births inherits MSUD. It also is believed to have a higher prevalence in certain populations due in part to the founder effect since MSUD has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish, Mennonite, and Jewish descent. \\n\\nGene therapy to overcome genetic mutations cause MSUD has already been proven safe in animals studies with MSUD. The gene therapy involve a healthy cope of the gene causing MSUD is produced and inserted into a viral vector. The adeno-associated virus vector is delivered one-time to the patient intravenously. Hepatocytes will take up vector and functional copies of affected gene is MSUD patients will be expressed. This will allow BCAA to be broken down properly and prevent toxic build up. \\n\\nSodium pheylacetate/benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate has been shown to reduce BCAA in a clinical trial done february 2011. Phenylbutyrate treatment reduced the blood concentration of BCAA and their corresponding BCKA in certain groups of MSUD patients and may be a possible adjunctive treatment. \\n\\nIsovaleric acidemia \\n\\nMethylmalonic acidemia \\n\\nPropionic acidemia \\n\\nJohn Menkes \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'A synovial sarcoma (also known as: malignant synovioma ) is a rare form of cancer which occurs primarily in the extremities of the arms or legs, often in proximity to joint capsules and tendon sheaths. It is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. \\n\\nThe name \" synovial sarcoma \" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium, and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial. \\n\\nPrimary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart. \\n\\nSynovial sarcoma occurs in about 1-2 per 1,000,000 people a year. They occur most commonly in the third decade of life, with males being affected more often than females (ratio around 1.2:1). \\n\\nSynovial sarcoma usually presents with an otherwise asymptomatic swelling or mass, although general symptoms related to malignancies can be reported such as fatigue. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18) chromosomal translocation. \\n\\nTwo cell types can be seen microscopically in synovial sarcoma. One fibrous type, known as a spindle or sarcomatous cell, is relatively small and uniform, and found in sheets. The other is epithelial in appearance. Classical synovial sarcoma has a biphasic appearance with both types present. Synovial sarcoma can also appear to be poorly differentiated or to be monophasic fibrous, consisting only of sheets of spindle cells. Some authorities state that, extremely rarely, there can be a monophasic epithelial form which causes difficulty in differential diagnosis. Depending on the site, there is similarity to biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, although the genetic findings are distinctive. \\n\\nLike other soft tissue sarcomas, there is no universal grading system for reporting histopathology results. In Europe, the Trojani or French system is gaining in popularity while the NCI grading system is more common in the United States. The Trojani system scores the sample, depending on tumour differentiation, mitotic index, and tumour necrosis, between 0 and 6 and then converts this into a grade of between 1 and 3, with 1 representing a less aggressive tumour. The NCI system is also a three-grade one, but takes a number of other factors into account. \\n\\nMost, and perhaps all, cases of synovial sarcoma are associated with a reciprocal translocation t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2). There is some debate about whether the molecular observation itself is definitive of synovial sarcoma. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18). This translocation event between the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 and one of 3 SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4) on chromosome X causes the presence of an SS18-SSX fusion gene. The resulting fusion protein brings together the transcriptional activating domain of SS18 and the transcriptional repressor domains of SSX. It also incorporates into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, a well known tumor suppressor. SS18-SSX is thought to underlie synovial sarcoma pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression. \\n\\nThere is some association between the SS18-SSX1 or SS18-SSX2 fusion type and both tumour morphology and five-year survival. \\n\\nTreatment is usually multimodal, involving surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy: \\n\\nSurgery, to remove the tumor and a safety margin of healthy tissue. This is the mainstay of synovial sarcoma treatment and is curative in approximately 20–70% of patients, depending on the particular study being quoted. \\n\\nConventional chemotherapy, (for example, doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide), to reduce the number of remaining microscopic metastases. \\n\\nRadiotherapy to reduce the chance of local recurrence.

The diagnostic code for excessive sexual drive, F52.7, was ‘decommissioned’ for use in the United States when ICD-10-CM [..] F52.8. DSM-5 also lists ‘other specified sexual dysfunction’ as F52.8 [13]. \" \\n\\nhttp://66.199.228.237/Sexual_Addiction/ConceptualizingHypersexuality-ATSA2009.pdf \\n\\n\" ICD 10 (WHO, 1992) \\n\\nExcessive sexual drive (Satyriasis and Nymphomania) [[outdated terms ..] \\n\\nDSM (APA, 2000) \\n\\nNo formal diagnostic category [..] \" \\n\\n--> \\n\\nSexual addiction, also known as sex addiction, is a state characterized by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity, particularly sexual intercourse, despite negative consequences. \\n\\nProponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder. The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania, Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders. \\n\\nThe concept of sexual addiction is contentious. There is considerable debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, sexologists, and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex, can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm. \\n\\nThe ICD-11 created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover \" a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour \" . \\n\\nNone of the official diagnostic classification frameworks list \" sexual addiction \" as a distinct disorder. \\n\\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) publishes and periodically updates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a widely recognized compendium of mental health diagnostics. \\n\\nThe version published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), referred to \" distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests or other forms of nonparaphilic sexual addiction, involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used. \" The reference to sexual addiction was subsequently removed. The DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR), did not include sexual addiction as a mental disorder. \\n\\nSome authors suggested that sexual addiction should be re-introduced into the DSM system; however, sexual addiction was rejected for inclusion in the DSM-5, which was published in 2013. Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the DSM-5 task force, said that \" [A]lthough \\'hypersexuality\\' is a proposed new addition...[the phenomenon] was not at the point where we were ready to call it an addiction. \" The proposed diagnosis does not make the cut as an official diagnosis due to a lack of research into diagnostic criteria for compulsive sexual behavior, according to the APA. \\n\\nThe World Health Organization produces the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is not limited to mental disorders. The most recent approved version of that document, ICD-10, includes \" excessive sexual drive \" as a diagnosis (code F52.7), subdividing it into satyriasis (for males) and nymphomania (for females). However, the ICD categorizes these diagnoses as compulsive behaviors or impulse control disorders and not addiction. The most recent (yet unapproved) version of that document, ICD-11, includes \" compulsive sexual behavior disorder \" as a diagnosis (code 6C72)—it does not use the addiction model. \\n\\nThe Chinese Society of Psychiatry produces the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), which is currently in its third edition the CCMD-3 does not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis. \\n\\nSome mental health providers have proposed various, but similar, criteria for diagnosing sexual addiction, including Patrick Carnes, and Aviel Goodman. Carnes authored the first clinical book about sex addiction in 1983, based on his own empirical research. His diagnostic model is still largely utilized by the thousands of certified sex addiction therapists (CSATs) trained by the organization he founded. No diagnostic proposal for sex addiction has been adopted into any official government diagnostic manual, however. \\n\\nDuring the update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to version 5 (DSM-5), the APA rejected two independent proposals for inclusion. \\n\\nIn 2011, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the largest medical consensus of physicians dedicated to treating and preventing addiction, redefined addiction as a chronic brain disorder, which for the first time broadened the definition of addiction from substances to include addictive behaviors and reward-seeking, such as gambling and sex. \\n\\nThe ICD, DSM and CCMD list promiscuity as a prevalent and problematic symptom for Borderline Personality Disorder. Individuals with this diagnosis sometimes engage in sexual behaviors that can appear out of control, distressing the individual or attracting negative reactions from others. There is therefore a risk that a person presenting with sex addiction, may in fact be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. This may lead to inappropriate or incomplete treatment. \\n\\nIn November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT), the official body for sex and relationship therapy in the United States, issued a position statement on Sex Addiction that states that AASECT, \" ...does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy. \" \\n\\nIn 2017, three new USA sexual health organizations found no support for the idea that sex or adult films were addictive in their position statement. \\n\\nIn 16 November 2017 the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA) published a position against sending sex offenders to sex addiction treatment facilities. Those centers argued that \" illegal \" behaviors were symptoms of sex addiction, which ATSA challenged they had no scientific evidence to support. \\n\\nAnimal research involving rats that exhibit compulsive sexual behavior has identified that this behavior is mediated through the same molecular mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug addiction. \\n\\nIn humans, a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by drug-induced compulsive engagement in sexual activity or gambling, has also been observed in some individuals taking dopaminergic medications. \\n\\nCurrent experimental models of addiction to natural rewards and drug reward demonstrate common alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection. ΔJunD is the transcription factor which directly opposes ΔFosB. \\n\\nΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. \\n\\nAs of 2017, none of the official regulatory bodies for Psychosexual Counselling or Sex and Relationship therapy, have accepted sex addiction as a distinct entity with associated treatment protocols. Indeed, some practitioners regard sex addiction as a potentially harmful diagnosis and draw parallels with gay conversion therapy. As a result, treatment for sex addiction is more often provided by addiction professionals than psychosexual specialists. \\n\\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a common form of behavioral treatment for addictions and maladaptive behaviors in general. Dialectical behavior therapy has been shown to improve treatment outcomes as well. Certified Sex Addiction Therapists (CSAT) a group of sexual addiction therapists certified by the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals offer specialized behavioral therapy designed specifically for sexual addiction. Their treatments have yet to be subject to peer-review, so it is unclear if they help or harm patients. \\n\\nThe term \" pre-exposure prophylaxis \" (PrEP) generally refers to the use of antiviral drugs to help prevent AIDS. PrEP is an optional treatment for people who are HIV-negative, but have a substantial risk of getting an HIV infection. \\n\\nIn the US, most insurance plans cover these drugs. \\n\\nAccording to a systematic review from 2014, observed prevalence rates of sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder range from 3% to 6%. Some studies suggest that sex addicts are disproportionately male, at 80%. \\n\\nSex addiction as a term first emerged in the mid-1970s when various members of Alcoholics Anonymous sought to apply the principles of 12-steps toward sexual recovery from serial infidelity and other unmanageable compulsive sex behaviors that were similar to the powerlessness and un-manageability they experienced with alcoholism. Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. \\n\\nThe controversy surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, in a clinical setting. As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans; drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs. \\n\\nThere have been debates regarding the definition and existence of sexual addictions for decades, as the issue was covered in a 1994 journal article. The Mayo Clinic considers sexual addiction a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and refer to it as sexual compulsivity (note that by definition, an addiction is a compulsion toward rewarding stimuli). A paper dating back to 1988 and a journal comment letter published in 2006 asserted that sex addiction is itself a myth, a by-product of cultural and other influences. The 1988 paper argued that the condition is instead a way of projecting social stigma onto patients. \\n\\nIn a report from 2003, Marty Klein, stated that \" the concept of sex addiction provides an excellent example of a model that is both sex-negative and politically disastrous. \" Klein singled out a number of features that he considered crucial limitations of the sex addiction model \\n\\nSexual addiction has been the main theme in a variety of films including Diary of a Sex Addict, I Am a Sex Addict, Black Snake Moan, Confessions of a Porn Addict, Shame, Thanks for Sharing, Choke. \\n\\nCompulsive masturbation \\n\\nHypersexuality \\n\\nInternet sex addiction \\n\\nPornography addiction \\n\\nSexual obsessions \\n\\nBooks that provide overview history and treatment techniques for sexual addiction include: \\n\\nOut of the Shadows: Understanding Sex Addiction by Patrick Carnes.

       "  {'title': 'Hypoplastic left heart syndrome',\n",
       "   'parsed_text': 'Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped. It may affect the left ventricle, aorta, aortic valve, or mitral valve. \\n\\nAt birth, the ductus arteriosus is still open, and there is higher than normal resistance to blood flow in the lungs. This allows for adequate oxygenation via mixing between the atria and a normal appearance at birth. When the ductus begins to close and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, blood flow through the ductus is restricted and flow to the lungs is increased, reducing oxygen delivery to the systemic circulation. This results in cyanosis and respiratory distress which can progress to cardiogenic shock. The first symptoms are cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen administration or poor feeding. Peripheral pulses may be weak and extremities cool to the touch. \\n\\nHLHS often co-occurs with low birth weight and premature birth. \\n\\nIn neonates with a small atrial septal defect, termed \" restrictive \" , there is inadequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. These neonates quickly decompensate and develop acidosis and cyanosis. \\n\\nOn EKG, right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are common, but not indicative of HLHS. Chest x-ray may show a large heart (cardiomegaly) or increased pulmonary vasculature. Neonates with HLHS do not typically have a heart murmur, but in some cases, a pulmonary flow murmur or tricuspid regurgitation murmur may be audible. \\n\\nCo-occurring tricuspid regurgitation or right ventricular dysfunction can cause hepatomegaly to develop. \\n\\nThere is no known cause in the majority of HLHS cases. Some cases may have a genetic component, as HLHS has been shown to be heritable and associated with specific gene mutations. \\n\\nIn a retrospective analysis of over 1,300 newborns (born between 1996 and 2006) from 24 children’s hospitals in the United States, researchers at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio found that babies with HLHS were more likely to be born in summer months, suggesting that seasonality and environmental factors may play a significant role in causation. \\n\\nGenetic loci associated with HLHS include GJA1 (connexin 43), HAND1, NKX2.5, 10q22, and 6q23. There is a slight risk of recurrence in future pregnancies, estimated to be 2-4%, which increases to 25% in families with two affected children. \\n\\nHLHS is also associated with several genetic syndromes, including trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), partial trisomy 9, Turner\\'s syndrome (XO), Jacobsen syndrome (11q deletion syndrome), Holt-Oram syndrome, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. \\n\\nPresence of a cystic hygroma increases the risk of HLHS in a fetus. \\n\\nIn typical anatomy, the left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. In people with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped (beginning in utero), and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether. As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it cannot be pumped to the rest of the body by the left ventricle. The neonate is reliant on blood flowing through an atrial septal defect to mix oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and on a patent ductus arteriosus to allow blood to reach the aorta and the systemic circulation via the right ventricle. This is what defines HLHS as a \" single ventricle \" defect. \\n\\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally or after birth via echocardiography. Typical findings include a small left ventricle and aorta, abnormalities of the mitral and aortic valves, retrograde flow in the transverse arch of the aorta, and left-to-right flow between the atria. It is often recognized during the second trimester of pregnancy, between 18 and 24 weeks\\' gestation. \\n\\nWithout life-prolonging interventions, HLHS is fatal, but with intervention, an infant may survive. A cardiothoracic surgeon may perform a series of operations or a full heart transplant. While surgical intervention has emerged as the standard of care in the United States, other national health systems, notably in France, approach diagnosis of HLHS in a more conservative manner, with an emphasis on termination of pregnancy or compassionate care after delivery. \\n\\nBefore surgery, the ductus must be kept open to allow blood-flow using medication containing prostaglandin. Air with less oxygen than normal is used for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These low oxygen levels increases the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and thus improve blood flow to the rest of the body due to the greater pressure difference between the lungs and body. Achieving oxygen levels below atmosphere requires the use of inhaled nitrogen. Nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, and thus reduces PVR and improves venous return. Any factor that increases PVR will impede right sided flow. \\n\\nSurgical operations to assist with hypoplastic left heart are complex and need to be individualized for each patient. A cardiologist must assess all medical and surgical options on a case-by-case basis. \\n\\nCurrently, infants undergo either the staged reconstructive surgery (Norwood or Sano procedure within a few days of birth, Glenn or Hemi-Fontan procedure at 3 to 6 months of age, and the Fontan procedure at 1 1/2 to 5 years of age) or cardiac transplantation. Current expectations are that 70% of those with HLHS may reach adulthood. Factors that increase an infant\\'s risk include lower birth weight, additional congenital anomalies, a genetic syndrome or those with a highly restrictive atrial septum. ) For patients without these additional risk factors, 5 year survival now approaches 80%. Studies show that about 75% of those children who survive surgery show developmental delays in one or more areas, such as motor, cognitive, or language impairments, with about a third of single-ventricle children without a genetic syndrome having significant impairments. Current research focuses on charting the connections between neurodevelopment injuries, surgical and intensive care procedures, and genetic susceptibility with the goal of modifying interventions that impair neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes. An alternative to the traditional Norwood is the Hybrid procedure. \\n\\nSome physicians offer \" compassionate care \" , instead of the surgeries, which results in the child\\'s death, usually within 2 weeks of birth. Compassionate care is overseen by a physician, and may be carried out either in the hospital or at home. However, due to the vast improvement of surgical intervention, with many hospitals achieving over 90% survival, there is debate on whether or not \" compassionate care \" should still be offered to families. A study in 2003 concluded that a selection of physicians who are experts in the care of children with HLHS were evenly split when asked what they would do if their own children were born with HLHS, with 1/3 stating that they would choose surgery, 1/3 stating that they would choose palliative (compassionate) treatment without surgery, and 1/3 stating that they are uncertain which choice they would make. \\n\\nThe three-stage procedure is a palliative procedure (not a cure), as the child\\'s circulation is made to work with only two of the heart\\'s four chambers. \\n\\nThe first step is the Norwood procedure. In this procedure, the right ventricle is used to pump blood into the systemic circulation. Since the right ventricle is no longer directly pumping blood to the lungs, a shunt is required in order to pass deoxygenated blood through the lungs. Either the subclavian artery can be connected to the pulmonary circulation (Blalock-Taussig shunt), or a shunt is made directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation (Sano shunt). The narrow aorta is enlarged using a patch to improve blood flow to the body. \\n\\nDuring this time the baby may be medically fragile and have feeding problems because the heart is working very hard. There is a considerable degree of venous mixing in the right ventricle, leading to lower oxygenation saturation. In addition, both the Blalock-Taussig and the Sano shunts expose the lungs to systemic arterial pressures, leading to long-term pulmonary hypertension and eventually heart failure. \\n\\nThe Hybrid procedure may be used in place of the Norwood. The Hybrid procedure does not necessitate the use of heart-lung bypass or performing a sternotomy. Instead of a six-hour surgery, the Hybrid typically takes one to two hours. In this procedure, a stent is placed in the ductus arteriosus to maintain its patency, and bands are placed over both the left and right pulmonary artery branches to limit pressure and over-circulation to the lungs. Outcomes with the Hybrid approach are comparable to those with the Norwood. \\n\\nThe second stage & mdash;the bidirectional Glenn or Hemi-Fontan (see also Kawashima procedure) & mdash;relieves some of the problems introduced by Stage I palliation. \\n\\nThe final procedure, the Fontan procedure, completes the repair of the hypoplastic left heart. \\n\\nInterventions performed during fetal development are under investigation. In fetuses with hypoplastic left ventricles and an intact interatrial septum, percutaneous atrial septostomy has been attempted. \\n\\n95% of untreated infants with HLHS die in the first weeks of life. \\n\\nEarly survival has improved since the introduction of the Norwood procedure. \\n\\nChildren with HLHS and other comparable single-ventricle conditions, as a group, have poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes than their healthy peers. Deficits in language, executive functioning, and higher rates of anxiety and depression disorders have been demonstrated. Some of these outcomes may be a consequence of genetic factors associated with HLHS, and others may be modifiable through changes to procedures and to the healthcare environment. There is an emerging clinical consensus around the importance of continuous neurodevelopmental surveillance from the earliest years into adulthood. \\n\\nAs is true for patients with other types of heart defects involving malformed valves, HLHS patients run a high risk of endocarditis, and must be monitored by a cardiologist for the rest of their lives to check on their heart function. \\n\\nHeart transplantation may be indicated, typically after Fontan completion. One multi-center study (of patients undergoing the Fontan from 1993-2001) reported a 76% 1-year survival rate in patients who survived to transplant. \\n\\nHLHS occurs in an estimated 1 out of 4,300 live births in the United States, or an estimated total of 960 live births per year in that country. Overall, it is estimated to make up 2-3% of all cases of congenital heart disease, and is the most common single-ventricle defect. It is thought to be more common in male infants, 1.5 times as common as in female infants. \\n\\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome information for parents.',\n",

       "   'parsed_text': 'A Smith\\'s fracture, is a fracture of the distal radius. It is caused by a direct blow to the dorsal forearm or falling onto flexed wrists, as opposed to a Colles\\' fracture which occurs as a result of falling onto wrists in extension. Smith\\'s fractures are less common than Colles\\' fractures. \\n\\nThe distal fracture fragment is displaced volarly (ventrally), as opposed to a Colles\\' fracture which the fragment is displaced dorsally. Depending on the severity of the impact, there may be one or many fragments and it may or may not involve the articular surface of the wrist joint. \\n\\nClassic physical examination findings of a Smith\\'s fracture is palmar displacement of the wrist that results in a \" garden-spade deformity \" . \\n\\nTwo views should be obtained: AP and lateral. \\n\\nPA radiography will look very similar to a Colles\\' fracture, with a fracture along the distal metaphysis of the radius (can be shortened or comminuted). Lateral radiography will demonstrate volar angulation / displacement of the fracture. \\n\\nA commonly used classification of distal radial fractures is the Frykman Classification : \\n\\nType I: Extra-articular \\n\\nType II: Type I, with fracture of distal ulna \\n\\nType III: Radiocarpal joint involvement \\n\\nType IV: Type III with fracture of distal ulna \\n\\nType V: Distal radioulnar joint involved. \\n\\nType VI: Type V with fracture of distal ulna \\n\\nType VII: Radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint both involved. \\n\\nType VIII: Type VII with fracture of distal ulna. \\n\\nTreatment of this fracture depends on the severity of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require closed reduction (putting into place without surgery). Significant angulation and deformity may require an open reduction and internal fixation. An open fracture will always require surgical intervention. \\n\\nIndications for operative management include dorsal or volar comminution, intra-articular involvement, instability post-reduction, angulation greater than 20 degrees, surface step-off over 2mm or shortening of the radius greater than 5mm. \\n\\nFor a closed reduction, the approach is the opposite of reductions completed for Colle\\'s fractures. In the case of a Smith\\'s fracture, the wrist must be reduced and splinted in extension. \\n\\nThe biggest concern is malunion of the wrist due to poor reduction or shortening of the distal radius. This can result in a permanent \" garden-spade deformity \" . \\n\\nThere are also higher risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and osteoarthritis in patients with a previous Smith fractures. \\n\\nEntrapment of the extensor pollicus longus can also occur in cases of non-union, and can result in late rupture of this tendon. \\n\\nComplex regional pain syndrome can be reported in up to 40% of fractures. \\n\\nThis fracture is named after the orthopedic surgeon, Robert William Smith (1807–1873) in his book A Treatise on Fractures in the Vicinity of Joints, and on certain forms of Accidents and Congenital Dislocations published in 1847. \\n\\nRadiograph of Smith\\'s fracture',\n",

Pathologically, there is motor axonal degeneration with antibody-mediated attacks of motor nerves and nodes of Ranvier. \\n\\nA link to Campylobacter jejuni was suspected when a young girl was admitted to Second Teaching Hospital. She had become ill after feeding the family chickens. She developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Investigators discovered that several of the chickens in the home displayed similar symptoms and C. jejuni was found in their droppings. Several of the paralysis patients were found to have antibodies to C. jejuni and anti-GD1a antibodies, suggesting a link between the pathogen and the disease. In 2015, Zika virus was linked to AMAN. \\n\\nThe syndrome typically presents as a progressive flaccid symmetric paralysis with areflexia, often causing respiratory failure. Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. Pathologically, it is a noninflammatory axonopathy without demyelination. Antibodies attack the coating of the motor neurons without causing inflammation or loss of myelin. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement. \\n\\nAMAN, also known as Chinese Paralytic Syndrome, was first described by a group of Johns Hopkins University and University of Pennsylvania neurologists in collaboration with neurologists from the Second Teaching Hospital of Hebei Medical School and Beijing Children's Hospital. In 1991, Guy Mckhann, Jack Griffin, Dave Cornblath and Tony Ho from Johns Hopkins University and Arthur Asbury from University of Pennsylvania visited China to study a mysterious epidemic of paralytic syndrome occurring in northern China. Every summer, hundreds of children from rural China developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Hospitals were overwhelmed with number of cases and often ran out of ventilators and hospital beds. Examination of these children showed that many of them had acute flaccid paralysis and areflexia but with little or no sensory loss. Electrophysiological testing of these children showed motor axonal loss with occasional conduction block with a lack of demyelinating features and normal sensory potentials. In contrast, the common form of Guillain\\u2013Barr\\u00e9 syndrome in the West often presents with sensory loss and demyelination on electrophysiology testing and is more common in adults. Later, several autopsies confirmed the focus of the immune attack was at the motor axolemma especially around the nodes of Ranvier. These cases showed deposition of antibody and complement along the motor axolemma and associated macrophage infiltration. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-14T20:35:13Z\", \"text_length\": 3272}\n",

In this case prompt medical action is required. \\n\\nThe main causes are M\\u00fcllerian agenesis and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. \\n\\nIn order to facilitate sexual intercourse, the main treatments are self-dilation methods (using intra-vaginal cylinders of increasing size) and surgical vaginoplasty to lengthen the vagina. \\n\\nSelf-dilation has a high success rate, estimated at 75%, and is usually the first-line treatment due to low surgical invasiveness. Overall, the complication rates are significantly lower with dilation than with vaginoplasty. \\n\\nSurgery is indicated when there is inability or reluctance to perform self-dilation, or where it is performed but with failed result. One appropriate surgical variant is the Vecchietti technique. In this procedure, an olive-shaped pressure device is pressed towards the potential vaginal space by a thread that goes through the skin, behind the urinary bladder and pubic bone and exits the skin in the hypogastrium, where it is attached to a plate that provides counter-traction. Vaginoplasty can also be performed using a skin graft or an intestinal graft. Traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%), whereas skin graft procedures and intestinal procedures have the lowest successful outcomes (83\\u201395%). \\n\\nAfter vaginoplasty, available evidence suggests that continued self-dilation is needed to maintain patency in periods of coital inactivity. \\n\\nVaginal hypoplasia is estimated to occur in 1 in 4,000\\u20135,000 live female births. It is often unnoticed until adolescence when pain and a lack of menstrual flow indicates the condition. \\n\\nCervical agenesis \\n\\nM\\u00fcllerian agenesis \\n\\nInternational Birth Defects Information System \\n\\nVagina, Anatomical Atlases, an Anatomical Digital Library (2018) \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-02-16T18:55:06Z\", \"text_length\": 3248}\n",

However, the increase of tryptophan in that disorder is negligible when compared to that of hypertryptophanemia. \\n\\nA number of abnormalities and symptoms have been observed with hypertryptophanemia. \\n\\nMusculoskeletal effects include: joint contractures of the elbows and interphalangeal joints of the fingers and thumbs (specifically the distal phalanges), pes planus (fallen arches), an ulnar drift affecting the fingers of both hands (an unusual, yet correctible feature where the fingers slant toward the ulnar side of the forearm), joint pain and laxity, and adduction of the thumbs (where the thumb appears drawn into the palm, related to contracture of the adductor pollicis). \\n\\nBehavioral, developmental and other anomalies often include: hypersexuality, perceptual hypersensitivity, emotional lability (mood swings), hyperaggressive behavior; hypertelorism (widely-set eyes), \\n\\noptical strabismus (misalignment) and myopia. \\n\\nMetabolically, hypertryptophanemia results in tryptophanuria and exhibits significantly elevated serum levels of tryptophan, exceeding 650% of maximum (normal range: 25-73 micromole/l) in some instances. \\n\\nA product of the bacterial biosynthesis of tryptophan is indole. The excess of tryptophan in hypertryptophanemia also results in substantial excretion of indoleic acids. These findings suggest a possible congenital defect in the metabolic pathway where tryptophan is converted to kynurenine. \\n\\nHypertryptophanemia is believed to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means a defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. \\n\\nAt present, no specific enzyme deficiency nor genetic mutation has been implicated as the cause of hypertryptophanemia. Several known factors regarding tryptophan metabolism and kynurenines, however, may explain the presence of behavioral abnormalities seen with the disorder. \\n\\nTryptophan is an essential amino acid, and is required for protein synthesis. Aside from this crucial role, the remainder of tryptophan is primarily metabolized along the kynurenine pathway in most tissues, including those of the brain and central nervous system. \\n\\nAs the main defect behind hypertryptophanemia is suspected to alter and disrupt the metabolic pathway from tryptophan to kynurenine, a possible correlation between hypertryptophanemia and the known effects of kynurenines on neuronal function, physiology and behavior may be of interest. \\n\\nOne of these kynurenines, aptly named kynurenic acid, serves as a neuroprotectant through its function as an antagonist at both nicotinic and glutamate receptors (responsive to the neurotransmitters nicotine and glutamate, respectively). This action is in opposition to the agonist quinolinic acid, another kynurenine, noted for its potential as a neurotoxin. Quinolinic acid activity has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease, the neuroprective abilities of kynurenic acid forming a counterbalance against this process, and the related excitotoxicity and similar damaging effects on neurons. \\n\\nIndoleic acid excretion is another indicator of hypertryptophanemia. Indirectly related to kynurenine metabolism, indole modifies neural function and human behavior by interacting with voltage-dependent sodium channels (integral membrane proteins that form ion channels, allowing vital synaptic action potentials). \\n\\nBlue diaper syndrome \\n\\nTryptamine \\n\\nSerotonin \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-17T17:29:45Z\", \"text_length\": 5110}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Cardiac fibroma\", \"parsed_text\": \"Cardiac fibroma, also known as cardiac fibromatosis, cardiac fibrous hamartoma, fibroelastic hamartoma of heart and fibroma of heart is the second highest type of primary cardiac tumor seen in infants and children. This benign tumor made by connective tissue and fibroblast is largely observed in the ventricles of the heart. The left ventricle is the most common location of cardiac fibroma and accounts for approximately 57% of cardiac fibroma cases followed by the right ventricle with 27.5% of cases. Symptoms of the disease depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the conduction system, and whether it obstructs blood flow. Two-thirds of children with this tumor are asymptomatic, showing no signs and symptoms. Therefore the cause of cardiac fibroma is unexplained but has been associated with Gorlin Syndrome. Echocardiography is the primarily diagnostic method used to detect if an individual has cardiac fibroma. Resection of the tumor is recommended however heart transplantation is done if surgery is not possible. Overall prognosis of resection is favorable and the chance of recurrence is scarcely reported. \\n\\nSigns and symptoms in cardiac fibroma are nonspecific, some individuals experience arrhythmias, dyspnea, cyanosis, chest-pain and sudden mortality. In addition, the majority of individuals with cardiac fibroma are asymptomatic therefore leading to signs and symptoms that depend on the size and location of the tumor. Tumors range from millimeters to extensive tumors in the range of 12.5 x 10.0 x 8.5 cm. For instance, individuals with larger tumors due to cardiac fibroma which include the conduction system of the heart can demonstrate cardiac dysrhythmias as a symptom. \\n\\nThe cause of cardiac fibroma is still unknown. However, some tumors have been found to be associated with Gorlin syndrome which is also known as Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS is a genetic condition that affects various parts of the body and increases the possibility of acquiring distinct cancerous and non cancerous tumors. \\n\\nThe mechanism behind cardiac fibromas is still unclear. Fibromas have a homogeneous mass of fibroblasts mixed with an abundance of collagen and elastic fibers. These masses represent mesenchymal growth, but lack other mesenchymal elements, such as blood vessels, cartilage bone, and muscle. These masses often entrap cardiomyocytes, which are muscle cells that make up the cardiac muscle; cells decrease while collagen content increase in these masses. The growth of cardiac fibromas are also slow and produce detrimental physical effects. This is due to infiltration and replacement of myocardium which protrude into the cavity of the heart. These tumors usually occur within the anterior wall of the left ventricle or the interventricular septum and rarely involves the right ventricle. Large fibromas bulge into the cavity of the chamber, interfering with the functions of heart valves and blood flow through the heart. When the left ventricular is obstructed, the outflow tract may give rise to a failed diagnosis of congenital subaortic stenosis. Moreover, it can cause severe congestive heart failure. Cardiac fibromas may present lymphocyte and monocyte aggregates, as well as areas of calcification, which are shown on a chest x-ray or CT scan. The dimensions of these masses and the location cause clinical symptoms. \\n\\nEarly and precise diagnosis of cardiac fibroma can lead to healing and avoidance of surgery. Echocardiography is the preferred initial method of diagnosis for cardiac fibroma. This is due to the exams non-invasiveness, reduced cost and extensive availability. Echocardiography depicts the morphologic appearance, region and motion of the tumor. On the other hand, additional examinations such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are also conducted for additional diagnostic information. The CT exam provides precise spatial resolution of the tumor meanwhile an MRI provides a comprehensive overview of tissue characterization and does not expose the patient to radiation. Tumor biopsy is utilized in cardiac fibroma as the gold standard to confirmation a patient diagnosis with cardiac fibroma. Family medical history and physical examination of an individual is also used as a diagnostic method, close examination of the heart is concluded along with careful detection of any abnormal heart sounds. \\n\\nCardiac fibroma is commonly treated through surgical excision procedures. The removal of the cardiac tumor requires open heart surgery. During surgery, the tumor and tissues around it is removed to reduce the risk of the tumor returning. Recovery after surgery is between 4\\u20135 days in the hospital and 6 weeks in total. An echocardiogram is taken every year after the surgery to make sure the tumor has not returned or formed any new growth. On the other hand, if surgery is not possible, a heart transplantation is required. \\n\\nCardiac fibromas in infancy which are unable to be removed surgically due to size and extensive myocardial infiltration, have a poor prognosis. The is due to the high ratio of tumor-to-heart size that may produce low cardiac output and as a result lead to a poorer prognosis. As a result, defibrillator implantation or cardiac transplantation may be required. However, tumors that are able to be surgically removed even incompletely have a good prognosis. Long-term survival after surgical resection is favorable, and the chance of recurrence is scarcely reported. \\n\\nCardiac fibromas account for 12%-16% of primary cardiac tumors in children. Therefore, leading it to be the second most common benign cardiac tumor in children. However, it has rarely been found in adults but mainly found in infants under the age of one. \\n\\nLiterature Survey on Epidemiology and Pathology of Cardiac Fibroma: \\n\\nDuring this study, researchers searched through the literature databases on cardiac fibroma to find factors that predict poor outcomes that lead to death. Researchers found that patients who did not survive were significantly younger than those who did survive. These results suggest that younger individuals diagnosed with cardiac fibroma are associated with a poorer outcome. Researchers found no significant difference between the maximum diameter of the tumor between age groups. However, although younger individuals have smaller hearts, the high ratio of tumor-to-heart sizes may generate low cardiac output, which leads to a poor outcome. In addition, literature revealed that 18 of 178 patients with cardiac fibroma were diagnosed during prenatal and neonatal periods, resulting in the tumor having a certain size regardless of the child's age. These findings suggest that cardiac fibromas may be a congenital disorder. \\n\\nSuccessful Surgical Excision of a Large Cardiac Fibroma in an Asymptomatic Child: \\n\\nA 3-year-old girl, who was asymptomatic, underwent a successful surgical excision of a large cardiac fibroma. The individual had frequent coughs, and therefore underwent several diagnostic exams to diagnose the cause of her frequent cough. A cardiac mass was found on the echocardiograph and later was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The cardiac mass was monitored and after 24 hours, it showed sinus rhythms of normal variability. In addition, the mass dimensions were 38 X 28 mm in the apical area of the left ventricle. A surgical procedure was recommended due to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The surgery was a success and physicians were able to remove the entire tumor without any complications. Follow-up evaluations at six-months and a year showed the patient in good health and no signs of tumor recurrence. \\n\\nPrimary Cardiac Tumors in Children: A Center's Experience: \\n\\nThe Department of Cardiac Surgery Children's Hospital in China conducted a study to analyze different characteristics and outcomes of pediatric patients who have primary cardiac tumors treated in their center. They had sixteen patients with primary cardiac tumors between the ages of 1\\u201313 years. All patients were diagnosed by echocardiography, MRI, and CT. 15 of the 16 patients were able to get successful remove of their mass and one patient had partial resection. However, one patient did died during surgery due to low cardiac output syndrome after five days of their initial surgery to remove their mass. The pathological examination of the cardiac masses showed that rhabdomyoma is the most frequent tumor in children, followed by myxoma and fibromas; morbidity of rhabdomyomas and fibromas were reported higher in infancy, while myxomas were more frequent in older children. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-07T21:32:07Z\", \"text_length\": 9881}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Dental avulsion\", \"parsed_text\": \"Dental avulsion is the complete displacement of a tooth from its socket in alveolar bone owing to trauma. \\n\\nThe treatment for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. Deciduous teeth should not be replanted due to the risk of damaging the permanent tooth germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the root surface. In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the periodontal ligament. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half. Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the root surface is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet, thus giving rise to storage media recommendations such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper osmolality (cell pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and glucose. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident. \\n\\nIn contact sports, such as rugby, and even in non-contact sports, such as basketball, there is significant risk of dental injury. The best method for the prevention of knocked-out teeth is the use of helmets and mouth protectors (mouthguards). Custom-made mouth protectors, as opposed to ill-fitting, over-the-counter mouth protectors offer the best protection. \\n\\nMouth protectors can be very inexpensive, however, the compliance rate for their use is poor. Studies have shown that, even when mandated, athletes and other high risk individuals often will not use them. Also, even with their use, mouth guards can be knocked-out, leaving the user unprotected. \\n\\nPostnormal occlusion \\n\\nAn over-jet exceeding 4 mm \\n\\nShort upper lip \\n\\nIncompetent lips \\n\\nMouth breathing \\n\\nDental avulsion is a real dental emergency in which prompt management (within 20\\u201340 minutes of injury) affects the prognosis of the tooth. The avulsed permanent tooth should be gently but well rinsed with saline, with care taken not to damage the surface of the root which may have living periodontal fiber and cells. Once the tooth and mouth are clean an attempt can be made to re-plant in its original socket within the alveolar bone and later splinted by a dentist for several weeks. Failure to re-plant the avulsed tooth within the first 40 minutes after the injury may result in a less favorable prognosis for the tooth. If the tooth cannot be immediately replaced in its socket, follow the directions for Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth and cold milk or saliva and take it to an emergency room or a dentist. If the mouth is sore or injured, cleansing of the wound may be necessary, along with stitches, local anesthesia, and an update of tetanus immunization if the mouth was contaminated with soil. Management of injured primary teeth differs from management of permanent teeth; avulsed primary tooth should not be re-planted (to avoid damage to the permanent dental crypt). \\n\\nAlthough some dentists advise that the best treatment for an avulsed tooth is immediate replantation, for a variety of reasons this can be difficult for the non-professional person. The teeth are often covered with debris. This debris must be washed off with a physiological solution and not scrubbed. Often multiple teeth are knocked-out and the person will not know which socket an individual tooth belongs to. The injured victim may have other more serious injuries that require more immediate attention or injuries such as a severely lacerated bleeding lip or gum that prevent easy visualization of the socket. Pain may be severe and the person may resist replantation of the teeth. People may, in light of infectious diseases (e.g. HIV), fear handling the teeth or touching the blood associated with them. If immediate replantation is not possible, the teeth should be placed in an appropriate storage solution and brought to a dentist who can then replant them. The dentist will clean the socket, wash the teeth if necessary, and replant them into their sockets. He will splint them to non-knocked-out teeth for a maximum of two weeks for teeth with normal alveolar process and bone support. Properly handled, even replantation of periodontally compromised permanent teeth in older patients under good maintenance have been reported, with splinting extending for over 4 weeks due to the reduced support structure for the root due to periodontal disease. One week to ten days after the replantation, the dental pulps of the replanted teeth should be removed and a root canal treatment completed within two months. \\n\\nIn addition, as recommended in all dental traumas good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking for several days may provide a favorable condition for periodontal ligaments regeneration. \\n\\nWhen a patient arrives at the Dentist they should be seen quickly and with urgency. If the tooth has not been placed in a suitable storage medium, the Dentist should do this immediately. A thorough extra oral and intra-oral examination should be performed. The clinician should consider the age of the patient, the history of the injury and that it is in line with clinical findings. If there is concern about non-accidental injury, then safeguarding procedures should be followed. \\n\\nPrior to the beginning of the procedure, a local anesthetic should be administered to both the palatal/lingual tissues to minimize discomfort. Gentle Irrigation with a saline solution should be performed as this removes any clots within the socket, which could prevent the proper re-positioning of the tooth into its original position. The tooth should always be handled via the enamel on the crown, not the root! Wash the root surface with saline, be careful not to scrub the root surface, as this may crush the delicate cells. Any stubborn debris can be removed by 'gently dabbing with gauze soaked in saline'. The tooth may then be gently placed back into the socket. \\n\\nSoaking is the practice of soaking the tooth in an active medicament before re-implantation. It has been shown that soaking the avulsed tooth in an immune-modulating drug prior to re-implantation can increase periodontal healing and tooth survival, compared to a saline control. \\n\\nEvery tooth is connected to its surrounding bone by the periodontal ligament. The tooth receives its nourishment through this ligament. When a tooth is knocked-out, this ligament is stretched and splits in half; half stays on the tooth root and half stays on the socket wall. If these two halves can be kept alive, the tooth can be replanted and the halves of the ligament will reattach and the tooth will remain vital. The half that stays on the socket wall, since it remains connected to the bone blood supply, is naturally kept alive. However, the ligament cells that remain on the tooth root lose their blood and nutrition supply and must be artificially maintained. They must be protected from two potentially destructive processes: cell crushing and loss of normal cell metabolism. All treatment between the time of the accident and the ultimate replantation must be focused on preventing these two possibilities. \\n\\nWhen teeth are knocked-out, they end up on an artificial surface: the floor, the ground or material such as carpeting. If the surface is hard, the tooth root cells will be traumatized. Since the cells remaining on the tooth root are very delicate, additional trauma to the tooth root cells must be avoided so as to avoid more tooth root cell crushing. This damage can occur while picking the tooth up and/or during transportation to the dentist. \\n\\nWhen a tooth is picked up, it should always be grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger pressure on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a physiologic saline. Even with the use of a physiologic saline, the \\u201cscrubbing\\u201d of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a physiologic solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the physiologic storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the physiologic storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a physiologic environment. \\n\\nNormally metabolizing tooth root cells have an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When there is an uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body at a later time is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called \\u201creplacement root resorption\\u201d. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called \\u201croot resorption\\u201d It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal tooth eruption and impedes normal jaw growth. \\n\\nResearch has shown that the critical factor for reduction of the death of the tooth root cells and the subsequent root replacement resorption following reimplantation of knocked-out teeth is maintenance of normal cell physiology and metabolism of the cells left on the tooth root while the tooth is out of the socket. In order to maintain this normalcy, the environment in which the teeth are stored must supply the optimum internal cell pressure, cell nutrients and pH. \\n\\nThere are many storage media available for knocked-out tooth storage. The most often recommended are: saliva, physiologic saline, milk and pH balanced cell preserving fluids. Water and ice have been shown to damage the tooth root cells, and as such, avulsed teeth should never be stored in them. The osmolality and pH of water and ice is very low (7-17mOs) compared to normal cell pressure (280 mOs). When a knocked-out tooth is placed in water, the cells attempt to equalize with the surrounding environment, the cell fluid tries to move to the outside pressure environment and burst. Water with table salt in it is damaging to the knocked out teeth. \\n\\nSaliva, that is placing the tooth under the accident victim\\u2019s tongue or in the cheek, has been recommended. Saliva, as a storage media, causes twice damage as water. Its osmolality is very low, causing bursting of the tooth root cells, but additionally, because saliva is filled with its normal flora of microorganisms, it will severely infect the tooth root cells. When the tooth is replanted, not only will the cells be necrotic but they will also infect the bone socket. \\n\\nPhysiologic saline has a fairly compatible osmolality and will not cause cell swelling but it lacks the metabolites and glucose necessary for maintenance of normal cell metabolism. \\n\\nMilk has been also recommended as a storage medium for avulsed teeth. Its advantage is the high availability of fresh whole milk. Only whole milk can be used for tooth preservation. Skim milk and heavy cream do not have the correct fluid pressure and will cause damage to the root cells. Milk has no observed regenerative properties for cells on knocked out teeth. \\n\\nIt was discovered 30 years ago that milk was less damaging to knocked out teeth than water or saliva. It was recommended because it has a compatible osmolality (fluid pressure) to tooth root cells and it is thought to be readily available. However, like physiologic saline, milk lacks the necessary metabolites and glucose necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism of the tooth root cells. The cells on knocked-out tooth roots in milk do not die immediately but are unable to replicate (mitosis) and so are less able to reform new cells when replanted. \\n\\nThe most optimum storage media that are available have been shown to be pH balanced cell preserving solutions. The best known and most extensively tested is called Hank\\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). It has all of the metabolites such as Ca, phosphate ions, K+ and glucose that are necessary to maintain normal cell metabolism for long periods of time. HBSS has been extensively tested in dental and medical research for the past twenty years. This research has shown that 90% of cells stored in HBSS for 24 hours maintain their normal viability and after four days, still have 70%viable. In research studies, extracted dog\\u2019s teeth that have been placed in HBSS for four days can still be replanted with little signs of resorption. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution is found in a Save-A-Tooth, a storage device for the storage, preservation, and regeneration of tooth root cells. \\n\\nHBSS also has been shown to be capable of replacing lost cell metabolites. Since a cell that has been cut off from its blood supply depletes its stored metabolites after fifteen minutes, a tooth that has been extra-oral for one hour has less vital cells to reconnect with the bone ligament cells. \\n\\nSome studies in dental research have shown that knocked out teeth that have been dry for up to one hour will have less resorption if they are soaked in a HBSS for 30 minutes prior to replantation. In these studies, dog\\u2019s teeth were extracted and left dry for 30, 45 and 60 minutes and then soaked in HBSS for 30 minutes and then reimplanted. These teeth showed 50% less replacement resorption following reimplantation. It has also been shown that keeping the teeth cold while in the HBSS does not affect success. \\n\\nMany other types of storage liquids have been tested such as powdered milk, Enfamil, Gatorade, and contact lens solution. All of them have been shown to either be ineffective or damaging to avulsed tooth. \\n\\nDespite the treatment provided, dental avulsion carries one of the poorest outcomes with 73-96% of the replanted teeth eventually being lost. There are three main factors which significantly influence the prognosis of the tooth. These include: \\n\\nThe extent of damage to the periodontal ligament (PDL) at the time of injury \\n\\nThe storage conditions of the avulsed tooth \\n\\nThe duration prior to replantation \\n\\nDental trauma varies widely in complexity and usually there is little that lay people or professionals (excluding dentists) can do. However, avulsion is the one type of traumatic dental injury where lay people can play a critical role in determining the prognosis of the tooth. The tooth has the best prognosis if it is replanted within 15 minutes of the accident but also has an excellent prognosis if it has been stored in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident. \\n\\nPDL healing is the primary outcome measure when assessing interventions for tooth avulsion. When the healing of the PDL is unfavourable it means that there is no longer protection for the root from the surrounding alveolar bone. The bone that surrounds the tooth is continually undergoing physiological remodelling. Over time, the root is gradually replaced by bone, which leads to the loss of tooth root and so the crown of the tooth fractures. \\n\\nThe results of replanting permanent incisor teeth can be divided into short, medium and long term survival of the tooth. If the tooth is replanted it acts in the short term to maintain space, maintain bone and provide good to excellent aesthetics. If unfavourable healing has occurred, the tooth can last into the medium term on 2-10+ years depending on the speed of bone turnover. Long-term survival of the tooth only happens when favourable healing of the periodontal ligament has occurred. If this happens the tooth can be estimated to survive as long as any other tooth \\n\\nResearch has shown that more than five million teeth are knocked-out each year in the United States. Dental avulsion is a type of dental trauma and the prevalence of dental trauma is estimated at 17.5% and can vary due to the geographical area. Although dental trauma is relatively low, dental avulsion is the fourth most prevalent type of dental trauma. \\n\\nDental avulsion is more prevalent in males than females. Males are three times more likely to suffer from dental avulsion than females. \\n\\nUp to 25% of school-aged children and military trainees and fighters experience some kind of dental trauma each year. The incidence of dental avulsion in school aged children ranges from 0.5 to 16% of all dental trauma. Many of these teeth are knocked-out during school activities or sporting events such as contact sports, football, basketball, and hockey. It is important for anyone whom is related, working, or witnessing sports that they be educated on this subject matter. Being educated could aid in minimizing injuries that could do further harm to the victim. Being informed and spreading awareness of dental avulsion in the state of knowledge, treatment, and prevention could make an impact. \\n\\nThe first reported cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth should be considered a temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the dental pulp following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the tooth root. In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank\\u2019s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank\\u2019s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog\\u2019s teeth that were dry for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog\\u2019s teeth could be stored in Hank\\u2019s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours. \\n\\nDental emergency \\n\\nDental trauma \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-26T21:13:02Z\", \"text_length\": 24616}\n",

Papillary fibroelastomas, while considered generally rare, make up about 10 percent of all primary tumors of the heart.

In particular, chest pain or syncope may be due to transient occlusion of the left main coronary artery by the tumor, while a heart attack or sudden cardiac death may be due to embolization of a portion of the tumor into a coronary artery. \\n\\nPapillary fibroelastoma are typically found and accurately diagnosed by imaging. \\n\\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by pathology.

      "{\"title\": \"Motor neuron disease\", \"parsed_text\": \"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body. \\n\\nAccording to ICD-11, the following disorders are counted among motor neuron diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), pseudobulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA), as well as some rarer variants resembling ALS. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases affect both children and adults. While each motor neuron disease affects patients differently, they all cause movement-related symptoms, mainly muscle weakness. Most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes, but some forms are inherited. Studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes (e.g. SOD1) that are thought be important in understanding how the disease occurs. \\n\\nSymptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life. Most of these diseases worsen over time; while some of them shorten one's life expectancy (e.g. ALS), others do not. \\n\\nCurrently, there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders, and care is mostly symptomatic. \\n\\nSigns and symptoms depend on the specific disease, but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement-related symptoms. They come on slowly, and worsen over the course of more than three months. Various patterns of muscle weakness are seen, and muscle cramps and spasms may occur. One can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs (exertion), difficulty breathing when lying down (orthopnea), or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved. Bulbar symptoms, including difficulty speaking (dysarthria), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and excessive saliva production (sialorrhea), can also occur. Sensation, or the ability to feel, is typically not affected. Emotional disturbance (e.g. pseudobulbar affect) and cognitive and behavioral changes (e.g. problems in word fluency, decision-making, and memory) are also seen. There can be lower motor neuron findings (e.g. muscle wasting, muscle twitching), upper motor neuron findings (e.g. brisk reflexes, Babinski reflex, Hoffman's reflex, increased muscle tone), or both. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases are seen both in children and in adults. Those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial, and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk. Those that affect adults tend to appear after age 40. The clinical course depends on the specific disease, but most progress or worsen over the course of months. Some are fatal (e.g. ALS), while others are not (e.g. PLS). \\n\\nVarious patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases. Weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric, and it can occur in body parts that are distal, proximal, or both... According to Statland et al., there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases, which are: \\n\\nAsymmetric distal weakness without sensory loss (e.g. ALS, PLS, PMA, MMA) \\n\\nSymmetric weakness without sensory loss (e.g. PMA, PLS) \\n\\nSymmetric focal midline proximal weakness (neck, trunk, bulbar involvement; e.g. ALS, PBP, PLS) \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases are on a spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings, while others have a mix of both. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, spasticity, muscle spasm, and abnormal reflexes. \\n\\nPure upper motor neuron diseases, or those with just UMN findings, include PLS. \\n\\nPure lower motor neuron diseases, or those with just LMN findings, include PMA. \\n\\nMotor neuron diseases with both UMN and LMN findings include both familial and sporadic ALS. \\n\\nMost cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known. It is thought that environmental, toxic, viral, or genetic factors may be involved. \\n\\nTARDBP (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), also referred to as TDP-43, is a critical component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enzymatic pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons. TDP-43 is rapidly recruited to double-strand breaks where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the XRCC4-DNA ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double-strand breaks. About 95% of ALS patients have abnormalities in the nucleus-cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of TDP43. In TDP-43 depleted human neural stem cell-derived motor neurons, as well as in sporadic ALS patients\\u2019 spinal cord specimens there is significant double-strand break accumulation and reduced levels of NHEJ. \\n\\nIn adults, men are more commonly affected than women. \\n\\nDifferential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms, shared between several motor neuron diseases. Frequently, the diagnosis is based on clinical findings (i.e. LMN vs. UMN signs and symptoms, patterns of weakness), family history of MND, and a variation of tests, many of which are used to rule out disease mimics, which can manifest with identical symptoms. \\n\\nPlease refer to individual articles for the diagnostic methods used in each individual motor neuron disease. \\n\\nMotor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on electrophysiological testing. As discussed above, the term \\\" motor neuron disease \\\" has varying meanings in different countries. Similarly, the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term \\\" motor neuron disease \\\" . The four main types of MND are marked () in the table below. \\n\\nAll types of MND can be differentiated by two defining characteristics: \\n\\nIs the disease sporadic or inherited? \\n\\nIs there involvement of the upper motor neurons (UMN), the lower motor neurons (LMN), or both? \\n\\nSporadic or acquired MNDs occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease. Inherited or genetic MNDs adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Some disorders, like ALS, can occur sporadically (85%) or can have a genetic cause (15%) with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease. \\n\\nUMNs are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord. LMNs originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles. Both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle, but damage to an UMN can be distinguished from damage to a LMN by physical exam. \\n\\nType UMN degeneration LMN degeneration \\n\\nSporadic MNDs \\n\\nSporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Yes Yes \\n\\nPrimary lateral sclerosis (PLS) Yes No \\n\\nProgressive muscular atrophy (PMA) No Yes \\n\\nProgressive bulbar palsy (PBP) Yes Yes, bulbar region \\n\\nPseudobulbar palsy Yes, bulbar region No \\n\\nMonomelic amyotrophy (MMA) \\n\\nNo \\n\\nYes \\n\\nInherited MNDs \\n\\nFamilial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\\n\\nYes \\n\\nYes \\n\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests: Analysis of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord could reveal signs of an infection or inflammation. \\n\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI of the brain and spinal cord is recommended in patients with UMN signs and symptoms to explore other causes, such as a tumor, inflammation, or lack of blood supply (stroke). \\n\\nElectromyogram (EMG) & nerve conduction study (NCS): The EMG, which evaluates muscle function, and NCS, which evaluates nerve function, are performed together in patients with LMN signs. \\n\\nFor patients with MND affecting the LMNs, the EMG will show evidence of: (1) acute denervation, which is ongoing as motor neurons degenerate, and (2) chronic denervation and reinnervation of the muscle, as the remaining motor neurons attempt to fill in for lost motor neurons. \\n\\nBy contrast, the NCS in these patients is usually normal. It can show a low compound muscle action potential (CMAP), which results from the loss of motor neurons, but the sensory neurons should remain unaffected. \\n\\nTissue biopsy: Taking a small sample of a muscle or nerve may be necessary if the EMG/NCS is not specific enough to rule out other causes of progressive muscle weakness, but it is rarely used. \\n\\nThere are no known curative treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders.

      "{\"title\": \"Tympanic membrane retraction\", \"parsed_text\": \"Tympanic membrane retraction describes a condition in which a part of the eardrum lies deeper within the ear than its normal position. \\n\\nThe eardrum comprises two parts, the pars tensa, which is the main part of the eardrum, and the pars flaccida, which is a smaller part of the eardrum located above the pars tensa. Either or both of these parts may become retracted. The retracted segment of eardrum is often known as a retraction pocket. The terms \\\" atelectasis \\\" or sometimes \\\" adhesive otitis media \\\" can be used to describe retraction of a large area of the pars tensa. \\n\\nTympanic membrane retraction is fairly common and has been observed in one quarter of a population of British school children. Retraction of both eardrums is less common than having a retraction in just one ear. It is more common in children with cleft palate. Tympanic membrane retraction also occurs in adults. \\n\\nAttempts have been made to categorise the extent of tympanic membrane retraction though the validity of these classifications is limited. \\n\\nThe majority of tympanic membrane retractions do not cause any symptoms. Some cause hearing loss by restricting sound-induced vibrations of the eardrum. Permanent conductive hearing loss can be caused by erosion of the ossicles (hearing bones). Discharge from the ear often indicates that the retraction pocket has developed into a cholesteatoma. \\n\\nThree factors must occur for the tympanic membrane to become retracted: \\n\\nWhen gas pressure within the middle ear is less than atmospheric pressure, the eardrum can become sucked into the middle ear space. This is caused by inadequate opening of the Eustachian tube and absorption of air from the middle ear space. People with a patulous Eustachian tube may also cause negative middle ear pressure by repeatedly sniffing to try to keep their Eustachian tube closed. \\n\\nThe middle layer of the pars tensa is strengthened by fibres of collagen protein. This layer may be weaker in the postero-superior quadrant (top rear quarter) or after the eardrum heals after perforation or tympanostomy tubes (grommets) so predispose to retraction in these areas. The pars flaccida is prone to retraction as it does not contain the same stiffening layer of collagen. \\n\\nAll over the body, new skin cells are continually produced to replace old skin cells which dry out and slough off. Growth of new cells on the surface of the eardrum is unusual in that the new cells migrate over the surface and move out along the ear canal. Even if migration along the ear canal is blocked, new cells continue to grow so the surface of the eardrum becomes larger. This process of proliferation and migration can result in enlargement of a retraction pocket so that the eardrum expands and grows deeper into the ear. \\n\\nThe majority of tympanic membrane retractions remain stable for long periods of time, or may even resolve spontaneously so that eardrum becomes normal again. Not all retractions are able to resolve even if middle ear pressure normalizes, as the retracted segment may become adherent to other structures within the middle ear. Some retractions continue to progress and grow more deeply into the ear. This can result in erosion of bone. \\n\\nAs the middle ear is only a narrow space, the eardrum only has to retract a short distance before it touches boney structures within the middle ear such as the ossicles. It may become adherent to these bones and in some cases, this contact leads to erosion of the bone. As well as ossicular erosion, the bone of the ear canal (e.g. the scutum) and even bone over the cochlea (the promontory) can become eroded. \\n\\nAs skin cells die they form a barrier of dry protein called keratin. This layer of keratin is normally pushed out of the ear by migration of skin cells along the ear canal and is turned into wax. Clearance of keratin can be disrupted by tympanic membrane retraction so that keratin accumulates within the retraction pocket. When keratin becomes trapped deep inside the ear and cannot be cleaned out, it is known as cholesteatoma. Growth of bacteria in the trapped keratin causes smelly discharge from the ear and can spread to cause serious infection. \\n\\nVarious strategies may be used to manage tympanic membrane retraction, with the aims of preventing or relieving hearing loss and cholesteatoma formation. \\n\\nAs retraction pockets may remain stable or resolve spontaneously, it may be appropriate to observe them for a period of time before considering any active treatment. \\n\\nThe Valsalva maneuver increases middle ear pressure and can push a retracted eardrum out of the middle ear if it is not adherent to middle ear structures. Hearing may improve as a result, however it can be a painful maneuver. The benefits are typically only temporary. Middle ear pressure can also be increased by Politzerization and with commercially available devices (e.g. Otovent and Ear Popper). \\n\\nA ventilation tube, also known as a tympanostomy tube or a grommet, may be placed through the eardrum to equalize middle ear pressure. Although this intervention may be effective, research has not yet shown whether it provides better results than simple observation. Further weakness or perforation of the eardrum may occur. \\n\\nThese are intended to improve Eustachian tube function. Adenoidectomy can improve middle ear function and nasal steroid sprays can reduce adenoid size but it is not known whether these treatments alter tympanic membrane retraction. \\n\\nEnlargement of the Eustachian tube opening in the nose with laser or balloon dilatation is being evaluated as a potential treatment for tympanic membrane retraction. \\n\\nExcision of the retracted segment of an eardrum, with or without placement of a tympanostomy tube has been advocated. Healing of the area can result in a more normal eardrum. Laser therapy has been used to shrink and stiffen retraction pockets. \\n\\nTympanoplasty is the surgical technique of removal of the retracted area from the middle ear and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. Some surgeons use cartilage (taken from the outer ear) to stiffen the eardrum with the aim of preventing further retraction. Surgical removal is required once a cholesteatoma has formed. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-04T02:18:03Z\", \"text_length\": 7452}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Hydrolethalus syndrome\", \"parsed_text\": \"Hydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes improper fetal development, resulting in birth defects and, most commonly, stillbirth. \\n\\nHLS is associated with HYLS1 mutations. The gene encoding HYLS1 is responsible for proper cilial development within the human body. Cilia are microscopic projections that allow sensory input and signalling output within cells, as well as cell motility. Dysfunction results in a range of abnormalities that are often the result of improper cell signalling. A variant form, HLS2, with additional mutations to the KIF7 gene, is less common. KIF7 also ensures correct cilia formation and function, specifically cilia stability and length. \\n\\nHydrolethalus syndrome (HLS) was first mistakenly identified in Finland, during a study on Meckel syndrome. Like HLS, Meckel syndrome presents with severe physiological abnormalities, namely disruptions to the central nervous system and the presence of extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). HLS can be distinguished from Meckel syndrome by analysing kidney function, which is dysfunctional in Meckel syndrome as a result of cyst formation. \\n\\nHLS presents itself as various, lethal developmental abnormalities, which often result in either premature stillbirth or death shortly after birth. Rare cases of children born with HLS surviving for several months have been noted. A characteristic abnormality of HLS is an absence of brain tissue and midline structures, with the presence of excess brain fluid (hydrocephalus) as a result of abnormal development of the central nervous system. Other common defects include incomplete lung development, heart defects, a cleft lip or palate, polydactyly, and an abnormally small jaw. Stillbirth and an excess of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) are common during pregnancy with a HLS-affected foetus, with cases of up to 8 litres cited compared to the normal 1 litre. Less common symptoms such as abnormally small eyes and a broad nose are also possible. \\n\\nHLS is caused by a genetic missense mutation of the HYLS1 gene, encoding for Hydrolethalus syndrome protein 1, on chromosome 11; a single base change to the amino acid sequence for HYLS1 in exon 6 involves the replacement of aspartic acid 211 with glycine (D211G) in the polypeptide chain. Exon 6 is the only protein coding exon in HYLS1; proper functioning of exons 1-5 ensures regulation and expression of the entire protein. \\n\\nHLS is an autosomal recessive syndrome; development is only possible if both parents carry the defective gene, and in that instance, the risk of the foetus developing the syndrome is 25%. HLS is a member of the Finnish disease heritage, with incidences more common in Finland than the rest of the world; roughly 1 in 20,000 developing foetuses are affected in Finland. Rare cases in other regions have also been documented, often with less severe phenotypes as a result of allele variability across countries, allowing survival of affected offspring for up to several months. Individuals of Finnish descent are advised to undergo genetic testing before attempting to conceive. \\n\\nPrior to the discovery of HLS, the HYLS1 gene was unknown, and similar genes within humans have not been identified. Orthologs, genes in other species with common ancestral heritage, have been examined to explain the pathophysiology of HLS; a similar gene within the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is responsible for the formation of cilia. Current hypotheses place a dysfunction of cilia as the main cause of HLS defects arising from the HYLS1 mutation in humans. \\n\\nDifferences between wild type and mutant HYLS1 have been clearly observed; the wild type form is localised to the cytoplasm, while the mutant form is localised to the nucleus and forms small clusters, suggesting that the mutant gene disrupts cellular localisation. The protein encoded by the HYLS1 mutant form is unable to carry out essential targeting of centrioles to the plasma membrane, disrupting ciliary function, which results in ciliopathy. As cilia are located in almost all cells throughout the body, cilial dysfunction causes developmental defects in a range of organs and thus the phenotype of HLS can vary greatly, though brain malformation and polydactyly are most commonly observed. \\n\\nCurrently, no environmental factors are known to increase the likelihood of HLS development or progression; HLS is caused only by genetic abnormalities. \\n\\nThe pathophysiology of HLS is abnormal cilia development arising from the inability of the mutated HYLS1 gene to correctly target centrioles to the plasma membrane. Specifically, transition fibres within the transition zone, at the base of the axoneme and adjoining to the plasma membrane, lack proper development. As these structures form the cilial gate, improper development results in a loss of selectivity for protein entry into the ciliary compartment. \\n\\nMutations in KIF7 have also been noted in patients that present a similar phenotype to HLS and the characteristic HYLS1 A to G transformation; homozygous deletion of the KIF7 gene causes a variant form of HLS, HLS2. KIF7 encodes a structural factor vital to cilial transport, and is also implicated in other developmental disorders, such as Joubert syndrome (JS). \\n\\nAdditionally, mutations in HYLS1 are no longer explicitly connected to HLS in humans. Homozygous mutations removing the stop codon in exon 4 of HYLS1 result in a different genomic sequence disruption to the missense mutation of HLS, and phenotypically present as JS. The \\u2018molar tooth sign\\u2019 of the brain, an anomaly in which cerebellar volume is reduced but cerebellar shape is retained, resembles the molar tooth and is used to identify JS. JS presents with mutations in more than 30 genes, whilst the HYLS1 mutation is the sole cause of HLS, but is also present in the HLS2 variant form with the mutated KIF7 gene. \\n\\nHLS can be readily diagnosed during pregnancy through the use of ultrasound, which will often reveal hydrocephaly and an abnormal structure of the brain. \\n\\nPrecise examination via ultrasound or at birth is necessary to rule out Meckel syndrome, Trisomy 13, or Smith\\u2013Lemli\\u2013Opitz syndrome, which present with similar physiological defects. HLS can be detected at the end of the first trimester, approximately 13 weeks gestation. \\n\\nNo cure or treatment option for individuals with HLS currently exist. Due to the severity of the foetal defects and the poor prognosis for those with HLS, the pregnancy is often terminated. Certain prevention can only be achieved by avoiding conception if genetic testing indicates both prospective parents as carriers of the defective HYLS1 gene. \\n\\n\\u2022HYLS1 \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-27T12:42:01Z\", \"text_length\": 8128}\n",

This genetically inherited condition affects the retina and the white matter of the central nervous system, resulting in vision loss, lacunar strokes and ultimately dementia. Symptoms commonly begin in the early to mid-forties, and treatments currently aim to manage or alleviate the symptoms rather than treating the underlying cause. The overall prognosis is poor, and death can sometimes occur within 10 years of the first symptoms appearing. \\n\\nNo recognizable symptoms until after age 40. \\n\\nNo environmental toxins have been found to be attributable to the condition. \\n\\nThe condition is primarily localized to the brain and eyes. \\n\\nOptically correctable, but continuous, deterioration of visual acuity due to extensive multifocal microvascular abnormalities and retinal neovascularization leading, ultimately, to a loss of vision. \\n\\nElevated levels of alkaline phosphatase. \\n\\nSubtle vascular changes in the retina resembling telangiectasia (spider veins) in the parafovea circulation. \\n\\nBilateral capillary occlusions involving the perifovea vessels as well as other isolated foci of occlusion in the posterior pole of the retina. \\n\\nHeadaches due to papilledema. \\n\\nMental confusion, loss of cognitive function, loss of memory, slowing of speech and hemiparesis due to \\u201cfirm masses\\u201d and white, granular, firm lesions in the brain. \\n\\nJacksonian seizures and grand mal seizure disorder. \\n\\nProgressive neurologic deterioration unresponsive to systemic corticosteroid therapy. \\n\\nDiscrete, often confluent, foci of coagulation necrosis in the cerebral white matter with intermittent findings of fine calcium deposition within the necrotic foci. \\n\\nVasculopathic changes involving both arteries and veins of medium and small caliber present in the cerebral white matter. \\n\\nFibroid necrosis of vessel walls with extravasation of fibrinoid material into adjacent parenchyma present in both necrotic and non-necrotic tissue. \\n\\nObliterative fibrosis in all the layers of many vessel walls. \\n\\nParivascular, adventitial fibrosis with limited intimal thickening. \\n\\nRaynaud's phenomenon \\n\\nAnemia \\n\\nHypertension \\n\\nNormocytic anemia \\n\\nNormochromic anemia \\n\\nGastrointestinal bleeding or telangiectasias \\n\\nElevated alkaline phosphatase \\n\\nThe official name of the TREX1 gene is \\u201cthree prime repair exonuclease 1.\\u201d The normal function of the TREX1 gene is to provide instructions for making the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. This enzyme is a DNA exonuclease, which means it trims molecules of DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the ends of the molecules. In this way, it breaks down unneeded DNA molecules or fragments that may be generated during genetic material in preparation for cell division, DNA repair, cell death, and other processes. \\n\\nChanges (mutations) to the TREX1 gene can result in a range of conditions one of which is AD-RVCL. The mutations to the TREX1 gene are believed to prevent the production of the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. Researchers suggest that the absence of this enzyme may result in an accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA molecules may be mistaken by cells for those of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions that result in the symptoms of AD-RVCL. \\n\\nMutations in the TREX1 gene have also been identified in people with other disorders involving the immune system. These disorders include a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including a rare form of SLE called chilblain lupus that mainly affects the skin. \\n\\nThe TREX1 gene is located on chromosome 3: base pairs 48,465,519 to 48,467,644 \\n\\nThe immune system is composed of white blood cells or leukocytes. \\n\\nThere are 5 different types of leukocytes. \\n\\nCombined, the 5 different leukocytes represent the 2 types of immune systems (The general or innate immune system and the adaptive or acquired immune system). \\n\\nThe adaptive immune system is composed of two types of cells (B-cells which release antibodies and T-cells which destroy abnormal and cancerous cells). \\n\\nDuring mitosis, tiny fragments of \\u201cscrap\\u201d single strand DNA naturally occur inside the cell. Enzymes find and destroy the \\u201cscrap\\u201d DNA. The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this single strand \\u201cscrap\\u201d DNA. A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the single strand DNA to be less than completely effective. The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows \\u201cscrap\\u201d single strand DNA to build up in the cell. The buildup of \\u201cscrap\\u201d single strand DNA alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal. \\n\\nThe abnormality of the cells with the high concentration of \\u201cscrap\\u201d DNA triggers a T-cell response and the abnormal cells are destroyed. Because the TREX1 gene is identical in all of the cells in the body the ineffective enzyme allows the accumulation of \\u201cscrap\\u201d single strand DNA in all of the cells in the body. Eventually, the immune system has destroyed enough of the cells in the walls of the blood vessels that the capillaries burst open. The capillary bursting happens throughout the body but is most recognizable when it happens in the eyes and brain because these are the two places where capillary bursting has the most pronounced effect. \\n\\nThe main pathologic process centers on small blood vessels that prematurely \\u201cdrop out\\u201d and disappear. The retina of the eye and white matter of the brain are the most sensitive to this pathologic process. Over a five to ten-year period, this vasculopathy (blood vessel pathology) results in vision loss and destructive brain lesions with neurologic deficits and death. \\n\\nMost recently, AD-RVCL (CRV) has been renamed. The new name is CHARIOT which stands for Cerebral Hereditary Angiopathy with vascular Retinopathy and Impaired Organ function caused by TREX1 mutations. \\n\\nCurrently, there is no therapy to prevent the blood vessel deterioration. \\n\\n1985 \\u2013 1988: CRV (Cerebral Retinal Vasculopathy) was discovered by John P.

      "{\"title\": \"Creatine transporter defect\", \"parsed_text\": \"Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD) is an inborn error of creatine metabolism in which creatine is not properly transported to the brain and muscles due to defective creatine transporters. CTD is an X-linked disorder caused by mutation in SLC6A8. SLC6A8 is located at Xq28. Hemizygous males with CTD express speech and behavior abnormalities, intellectual disabilities, development delay, seizures, and autistic behavior. Heterozygous females with CTD generally express fewer, less severe symptoms. CTD is one of three different types of cerebral creatine deficiency (CCD). The other two types of CCD are guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and deficiency. Clinical presentation of CTD is similar to that of GAMT and AGAT deficiency. CTD was first identified in 2001 with the presence of a hemizygous nonsense change in SLC6A8 in a male patient. \\n\\nGenerally, the majority of individuals with creatine transporter defect express the following symptoms with varying levels of severity: developmental delay and regression, mental retardation, and abnormalities in expressive and cognitive speech. However, several studies have shown a wider variety of symptoms including, but not limited to attention deficit and hyperactivity with impulsivity, myopathy, hypotonia, semantic-pragmatic language disorder, oral dyspraxia, extrapyramidal movement disorder, constipation, absent speech development, seizures, and epilepsy. Furthermore, symptoms can significantly vary between hemizygous males and heterozygous females, although, symptoms are generally more severe in hemizygous males. Hemizygous males more commonly express seizures, growth deficiency, severe mental retardation, and severe expressive language impairment. Heterozygous females more commonly express mild intellectual disability, impairments to confrontational naming and verbal memory, and learning and behavior problems. \\n\\nCTD is caused by pathogenic variants in SLC6A8, located at Xq28. SLC6A8 contains 13 exons and spreads across 8.5 kb of genomic DNA (gDNA). The presence of hemizygous variants in males and heterozygous variants in females in SLC6A8 provides evidence that CTD is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This usually results in hemizygous males having severe symptoms, while heterozygous female carriers tend to have less severe and more varying symptoms. \\n\\nThe creatine phosphate system is needed for the storage and transmission of phosphate-bound energy in the brain and muscle. The brain and muscle have particularly high metabolic demands, therefore, making creatine a necessary molecule in ATP homeostasis. In regard to the brain, in order for creatine to reach the brain, it must first pass through the blood\\u2013brain barrier (BBB). The BBB separates blood from brain interstitial fluid and is, therefore, able to regulate the transfer of nutrients to the brain from the blood. In order to pass through the BBB, creatine utilizes creatine transporter (CRT). When present at the BBB, CRT mediates the passage of creatine from the blood to the brain. When being transported from the blood to the brain, creatine has to constantly move against the creatine concentration gradient that is present at the border between the brain and circulating blood. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of CTD is usually suspected based on the clinical presentation of intellectual disability, abnormalities in cognitive and expressive speech, and developmental delay. Furthermore, a family history of X-linked intellectual disability, developmental coordination disorder, and seizures is strongly suggestive. Initial screening of CTD involves obtaining a urine sample and measuring the ratio of creatine to creatinine. If the ratio of creatine to creatinine is greater than 1.5, then the presence of CTD is highly likely. This is because a large ratio indicates a high amount of creatine in the urine. This, in turn, indicates inadequate transport of creatine into the brain and muscle. However, the urine screening test often fails in diagnosing heterozygous females. Studies have demonstrated that as a group heterozygous females have significantly decreased cerebral creatine concentration, but that individual heterozygous females often have normal creatine concentrations found in their urine. Therefore, urine screening tests are unreliable as a standard test for diagnosing CTD, particularly in females. \\n\\nA more reliable and sophisticated manner of testing for cerebral creatine concentrations is through in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). In vivo 1H MRS uses proton signals to determine the concentration of specific metabolites. This method of testing is more reliable because it provides a fairly accurate measurement of the amount of creatine inside the brain. Similar to urine testing, a drawback of using 1H MRS as a test for CTD is that the results of the test could be attributed to any of the cerebral creatine deficiencies. The most accurate and reliable method of testing for CTD is through DNA sequence analysis of SLC6A8. DNA analysis of SLC6A8 allows the identification of the location and type of variant causing the cerebral creatine deficiency. Furthermore, DNA analysis of SLC6A8 is able to prove that a cerebral creatine deficiency is due to CTD and not GAMT or AGAT deficiency. \\n\\nCTD is difficult to treat because the actual transporter responsible for transporting creatine to the brain and muscles is defective. Affected individuals have sufficient amounts of creatine, however it cannot get to the tissues where it is needed. Studies in which oral creatine monohydrate supplements were given to patients with CTD found that patients did not respond to treatment. However, similar studies conducted in which patients that had GAMT or AGAT deficiency were given oral creatine monohydrate supplements found that patient\\u2019s clinical symptoms improved. Patients with CTD are unresponsive to oral creatine monohydrate supplements because regardless of the amount of creatine they ingest, the creatine transporter is still defective, and therefore creatine is incapable of being transported across the BBB. Given the major role that the BBB has in the transport of creatine to the brain and unresponsiveness of oral creatine monohydrate supplements in CTD patients, future research will focus on working with the BBB to deliver creatine supplements. However, given the limited number of patients that have been identified with CTD, future treatment strategies must be more effective and efficient when recognizing individuals with CTD. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-31T19:32:32Z\", \"text_length\": 7606}\n",

The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive. Some of their fears include body odor, gas, excessive or insufficient eye contact, blushing, etc. \\n\\nIn the official Japanese diagnostic system, taijin kyofusho is subdivided into the following categories: \\n\\nSekimen-kyofu (), the phobia of blushing (ereuthophobia) \\n\\nShubo-kyofu (), the phobia of a deformed body, similar to body dysmorphic disorder \\n\\nJikoshisen-kyofu (), the phobia of eye contact \\n\\nJikoshu-kyofu (), the phobia of having foul body odor (also termed olfactory reference syndrome, osmophobia or bromidrosiphobia) \\n\\nJapan psychology also recognizes additional types of taijin kyofusho based on severity: \\n\\nTransient: This type of taijin kyofusho is short-lived and moderately severe. It most commonly appears in teens, but may occur at any time. \\n\\nDelusional: This is the most common type of taijin kyofusho and is the most similar to social phobia. It is chronic, often begins before the age of 30, and varies in severity from moderate to severe. \\n\\nPhobic with schizophrenia: This is a more complicated disorder. In such cases, rather than a phobia, taijin kyofusho is a manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms. \\n\\nA person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through shame, embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so. Those likely to develop taijin kyofusho have more of a temperamental characteristic of being hypochondriacal. The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion. The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have, and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed. \\n\\nA problem with culture-bound syndromes is that they are resistant to some medicine. } The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is Morita therapy, developed by Shoma Morita in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu (nervousness). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced bed rest, diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and group treatments. This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho. Other treatments include systematic desensitization, which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear, and learning relaxation skills, to extinguish fear and anxiety. \\n\\nMilnacipran, a serotonin\\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related social anxiety disorder. The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations. \\n\\nTypically, this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and shyness. It is possible that it could result from a humiliating traumatic experience, or it could emerge from a lifelong onset of the illness that only comes to the surface after time. \\n\\nClinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females, despite the fact that females scored higher on a social phobia scale than men, and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males. The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3% and 13% with changes in severity occurring throughout one's lifetime. It is estimated that about 17% of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor. \\n\\nAnthropophobia \\n\\nAvoidant personality disorder \\n\\nHikikomori \\n\\nNEET \\n\\nObsessive\\u2013compulsive disorder \\n\\nhttp://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/taijin-kyofusho-the-disorder-of-fear \\n\\nhttp://anthropology.msu.edu/anp204-us12/2012/07/20/taijin-kyofusho-in-japan-and-south-korea/ \\n\\nhttp://www.stolaf.edu/depts/ciswp/khughes/papers/psychopathology.pdf \\n\\nhttp://jcc.sagepub.com/content/43/2/219.abstract\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-27T02:22:25Z\", \"text_length\": 8529}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Tooth ankylosis\", \"parsed_text\": \"Tooth ankylosis is the pathological fusion between alveolar bone and the cementum of teeth, which is a rare phenomenon in the deciduous dentition and even more uncommon in permanent teeth. Ankylosis occurs when partial root resorption is followed by repair with either cementum or dentine that unites the tooth root with the alveolar bone, usually after trauma. However, root resorption does not necessarily lead to tooth ankylosis and the causes of tooth ankylosis remain uncertain to a large extent. However, it is evident that the incident rate of ankylosis in deciduous teeth is much higher than that of permanent teeth. \\n\\nRisk factors of tooth ankylosis can be generally classified into genetic factors and dental trauma. Diagnostic methods of tooth ankylosis include the use of clinical examinations, x-ray and cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). Tooth ankylosis could have several symptoms, with decreased tooth count being the most prominent one. Factors like gender and sex may also lead to the incidence of certain signs, yet the full mechanisms have not been well evaluated. In general, the non-growing subjects and growing subjects would exhibit different signs and symptoms. \\n\\nThe individuals suffering from ankylosis of deciduous teeth would experience the risk of losing the teeth in the end due to the failure of the tooth eruption during facial growth and would lead to a series of functional and aesthetical problems. After diagnosed with clinical examination or CBCT image, tooth ankylosis is often treated by removing the crown of the affected tooth. Early orthodontic interception is also confirmed to be effective in promoting the recovery of the lost space as well as allowing the eruption of the teeth. It is current under the investigation of its probability being used as a prevention of tooth ankylosis. \\n\\nSince ankylosis may hinder the normal development of teeth, early diagnosis and intercession is important to avoid further progression and deterioration of the situation. In particular, when such an abnormality is found in deciduous teeth among children and adolescents, it would often result in the infraocclusion of the ankylosed tooth, inclination of the teeth adjacent to the space. Subsequently, impaction of the permanent successor tooth would result. In light of the situation, early interceptive orthodontic treatment is confirmed to be effective in promoting the recovery of the lost space as well as allowing the eruption of the teeth. According to a reported case, this method provided positive results and ameliorated the situation of the patient. \\n\\nTooth ankylosis can be recognised clinically by the loss of physiological mobility, and a high P note. It may also be detected radiographically, loss of periodontal ligament space and evidence of replacement resorption. Ankylosis usually initially occurs on the labial and lingual root surfaces making radiographic detection in the early stages difficult. Early diagnosis allows the practitioner to plan for future complications. \\n\\nThe signs and symptoms for patients can be varied mainly depending on the growing state of teeth (permanent or deciduous). Other factors, such as age, sex, site of infection may also lead to the occurrence of specific signs and symptoms, but their roles are not well-studied and evaluated. General symptoms include decreased tooth count, abnormal tooth enamel, curving of the fifth digit, enlarged lower jaw and abnormal dentition, with decreased tooth count as the most frequent symptom. \\n\\nFor non-growing subjects who possess fully developed permanent teeth, there may not be any observable symptoms. The alveolar support of the affected tooth will be lowered due to continuous replacement resorption of the root. This process will stop with the appearance of root fractures and shed crown, and changes in dentition, especially the anterior teeth, can be observed in this stage. Symptoms such as infraocclusion and asymmetry in the smile arc may be developed. However, for ankylosis in posterior teeth happening in non-growing subjects, it may be completely asymptomatic because the slow change in height of the affected teeth may not be noticeable to both the patient and the doctor, compared to that happened in anterior teeth. \\n\\nFor growing subjects, symptoms can also be varied as different growth aspects of teeth including the vertical, sagittal and transverse growth are different in children and adolescents. Generally, symptoms are more severe for earlier occurrence of the disease. Most ankyloses occurring in children are trauma-induced, which can lead to malposition of the affected teeth as the major symptom. \\n\\nFor moderate and severe conditions in growing subjects, symptoms such as functional impairment due to loss of occlusal contacts which results from the reduced vertical distance of the ankylosed teeth, and shift in dental midline associated with tipping of adjacent teeth towards the affected tooth, are likely to be developed. Alternatively, open bite and supra-eruption of opposing teeth may also be noticed. \\n\\nThe causes of ankylosis of teeth is uncertain. One common belief is the role of genetic factors with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, evidenced by the appearance of family occurrence in several families. Trauma, inflammation and infection may also be responsible for causing the disease. \\n\\nThe frequency for ankylosis to happen in deciduous teeth is far more frequent than that in permanent teeth, with a ratio of about 10 to 1, and the majority of the ankylosed teeth occur in lower teeth, about twice as often as in the upper teeth. Therefore, it is strongly believed that their incidence may be due to different causes. \\n\\nFor ankylosis in permanent teeth, with the first molar being the most common affected teeth, it is hard to find a precise cause because of the complicated nature which is believed to be linked to several different factors and the difficulty in diagnosis as many cases are asymptomatic. \\n\\nFor other cases, there are several theories explaining the cause. Dental trauma may be a major cause for the disease since it can lead to luxation, reported in 30 to 44% of all dental trauma cases, and hence replacement resorption, which is the situation in ankylosis of teeth. The association between tooth ankylosis and orthodontic treatment are also observed in some cases, in which the leakage of etchant to the junction between cementum and enamel during the surgery, damage to the junction or tilting of the tooth may be some possible mechanisms to relate the disease to the treatment. Genetic factors may also be involved in causing the disease, which is supported by the occurrence of ankylosed molars, either in primary or permanent dentition, in close relatives. The possible explanation is the inheritance of a gene which might be a process imitator of ankylosis in the periodontal ligament. This gene can then be transferred from parents to offsprings and lead to ankylosis of teeth. \\n\\nAnkylosis of deciduous teeth may rarely occur. The most commonly affected tooth is the mandibular (lower) second deciduous molar. Partial root resorption first occurs and then the tooth fuses to the bone. This prevents normal exfoliation of the deciduous tooth and typically causes impaction of the permanent successor tooth. As growth of the alveolar bone continues and the adjacent permanent teeth erupt, the ankylosed deciduous tooth appears to submerge into the bone, although in reality it has not changed position. Treatment is by extraction of the involved tooth, to prevent malocclusion, periodontal disturbance or dental caries. \\n\\nIn healthy teeth, the periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts block osteogenic cells within the periodontium by releasing locally acting regulators. This separates the tooth root from alveolar bone. Damage to the PDL disrupts this process resulting bone growth across the periodontal space and fusion with the root. It may occur following dental trauma, especially re-implanted or severely intruded teeth. Increasing the extra oral dry time increases the likelihood of ankylosis The probability also increases with the severity of intrusion. There is no known treatment to arrest the process. Ankylosis itself is not a reason to remove a permanent tooth, however teeth which must be removed for other reasons are made significantly more difficult to remove if they are ankylosed. Ankylosis in growing patients can result in infra occlusion of teeth, this can lead to an aesthetic and functional deficit. \\n\\nAs ankylosis of teeth is often associated with metabolic abnormalities and deficiencies in vertical-bone growth, positive family history with the occurrence of dental ankylosis cases would be a prominent risk factor since such pathological condition could be inherited. Furthermore, other factors or activities that would contribute to injuries, inflammations or infections would also increase the risk of developing ankylosis of teeth. \\n\\nAnkylosis initiates with extensive necrosis of the periodontal ligament with formation of bone which will invade the denuded root surface area. Trauma is believed to be the cause of ankylosis, causing cell death on the root surface. Ankylosis may happen once the injured surface area has reached more than 20%. Damage to the root surface area will trigger an inflammatory response, migration and repopulation of faster bone forming cells, instead of slower periodontal ligament fibroblasts or cementoblasts, occurring in the teeth root surface. In this stage, the teeth are termed to be ankylosed. This migration and repopulation process, termed replacement resorption, will continue and thus the teeth root will become fused with the bone tissue adjacent to it. \\n\\nDiagnostic methods of tooth ankylosis include the use of clinical examinations and x-ray. The feasibility of using cone beam computed tomography to diagnose ankylosed teeth is also explored and discussed in a recent research article. \\n\\nExaminations of teeth are carried out to identify typical features of ankylosis, these features include varying percussion sound with adjacent normal teeth and a lack of mobility. However, these examinations are not always reliable. Although a metal sound on examination of percussion is usually used to indicate the presence of ankylosis, it is found that only one-third of ankylosed teeth give a metal sound in percussion test. In addition, a lack of mobility is not a definitive sign of ankylosis as the tooth can still be mobile if less than 20% of root surface is ankylosed . A definitive diagnosis of ankylosis is believed to be given by checking the mobility of the targeted tooth after applying orthodontic force, an ankylosed tooth will show no mobility. \\n\\nIn early detection of ankylosis, radiographic examination is not effective because it only produces 2-dimensional graphic. This means that the ankylosed site would not be apparent if it is not perpendicular to the x-ray beam. Therefore, it is impossible to identify ankylosis in some areas using x-ray, for instance, buccal or lingual root surface. To overcome such difficulty, cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) is adopted to provide a 3-dimensional image for better clinical inspection of ankylosis. In a recent research article, a retrospective cohort study was conducted where a wide range of teeth clinically diagnosed as ankylosed were collected and analyzed. The histological sections of each tooth obtained from the CBCT scan were then evaluated by two specialists blinded to the details of the research to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the result. As a result, all histologically established ankylosed teeth were identified by both observers provided with the CBCT image but some false positive results were obtained. It is concluded that CBCT scan can be used as a feasible and effective diagnostic method when it comes to the detection of tooth ankylosis. However, it is not recommended to treat CBCT image as the sole model in the identification of ankylosed teeth unless the false positive results are being eliminated. \\n\\nAnkylosis and primary fail of eruption (PFE) give similar symptoms, since in both cases a targeted tooth is positioned not vertically and unresponsive to orthodontic force applied. Therefore, ankylosis should be differentiated from primary fail of eruption. For an ankylosed molar, distal teeth can respond to orthodontic force normally and thus can be used as substitute if the ankylosed tooth is extracted. Surgical luxation is sometimes used to break the ankylosis bridge to restore occlusion. For a case of PFE, the targeted molar can only be treated by osteotomy to restore its occlusion. \\n\\nGrowing state of patient is one of the factors when deciding what treatment is going to be used. \\n\\nFor growing patients, decoronation is used. Decoronation is the removal of tooth crown. It serves as an alternative surgery for tooth extraction.It is recommended over extraction because it limits bone resorption and therefore maintains a sufficient growth of alveolar bone to enable tooth implantation . Decoronation can be carried out on both deciduous and permanent teeth. However, if the patient is too young and not close to puberty, decoronation should be postponed . In order to maximize the benefits of decoronation, regular monitoring and intervention are needed \\n\\nFor non-growing patients, decoronation is generally not recommended because the growth of alveolar bone may be inadequate for a future tooth implant, and therefore is said to not give ideal treatment outcomes. As a result, other methods are considered when treating non-growing patients. \\n\\nFollow-ups are often being adopted in the cases of late onset tooth ankylosis. As tooth growth is insignificant, no surgical procedures are needed to treat the ankylosed tooth as long as its height difference with adjacent teeth is small. In some cases where the height difference is more significant, tooth crown build-up is recommended to restore occlusion. \\n\\nIn addition to tooth crown build-up, ankylosed teeth repositioning is another conservative method. In surgical luxation, after the bridge of ankylosis is broken mechanically, the tooth is positioned slightly away from its original site and allowed to erupt with a temporary insertion of a splint or an orthodontic appliance. Tooth repositioning can also be performed by osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis in cases where surgical luxation fails, or as alternatives. \\n\\nExtraction of an ankylosed tooth can be considered in both growing and non-growing patients. This method usually serves as a last resort when other methods such as osteotomy and distraction osteogenesis fail to treat ankylosis. \\n\\nGrowing state of patient is not the sole factor when deciding the treatment for an ankylosed tooth. Infraocclusion severity, bone resorption, location of the target tooth as well as dentist's preference all affect the option for treatment. Therefore, treatment for an ankylosed tooth is case-specific. \\n\\nThe prevalence of tooth ankylosis is still unknown. Individuals of both genders regarless of the ethnic groups may be affected due to inheritance or sporadic traumatic injuries. \\n\\n</references>\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-24T19:11:05Z\", \"text_length\": 16987}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Steroid dementia syndrome\", \"parsed_text\": \"Steroid dementia syndrome describes the signs and symptoms of hippocampal and prefrontal cortical dysfunction, such as deficits in memory, attention, and executive function, induced by glucocorticoids. Dementia-like symptoms have been found in some individuals who have been exposed to glucocorticoid medication, often dispensed in the form of asthma, arthritis, and anti-inflammatory steroid medications. The condition reverses, but not always completely, within months after steroid treatment is stopped. \\n\\nThe term \\\" steroid dementia \\\" was coined by Varney et al. (1984) in reference to the effects of long-term glucocorticoid use in 1,500 patients. While the condition generally falls under the classification of Cushing's syndrome, the term \\\" steroid dementia syndrome \\\" is particularly useful because it recognizes both the cause of the syndrome and the specific effects of glucocorticoids on cognitive function. Further, the more precise terminology clearly distinguishes the condition from full-blown Cushing's syndrome, which is extremely broad regarding the causes (endogenous or exogenous, pituitary or adrenal) and the multitude of symptoms (ranging from skin disorders to osteoporosis), and from hypercortisolemia, which identifies neither the source nor the symptoms of excess circulatory cortisol. \\n\\nCognitive symptoms from steroids appear within the first few weeks of treatment, appear to be dose dependent, and may or may not be accompanied by steroid psychosis or other Cushing's-type symptoms. \\n\\nThe symptoms include deficits in \\n\\nverbal and non-verbal memory \\n\\nworking memory \\n\\nattention \\n\\nsustained concentration \\n\\nexecutive function \\n\\npsychomotor speed \\n\\nacademic or occupational performance. \\n\\nThese symptoms have been shown to improve within months to a year after discontinuing glucocorticoid medication, but residual impairments following prolonged steroid use can remain. \\n\\nRegions of the brain with a high density of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex are particularly sensitive to elevated circulating levels of glucocorticoids even in the absence of stress. Scientific studies have mainly focused on the impact of glucocorticoids on the hippocampus because of its role in memory processes and on the prefrontal cortex for its role in attention and executive function. \\n\\nElevated glucocorticoid activity is associated with down-regulation of GRs (known as \\\" glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis \\\" ), which diminishes neuroreparative activity and attenuates neurogenesis that can result in decreased hippocampal volume with prolonged glucocorticoid exposure. \\n\\nVariations in individual sensitivity to glucocorticoid medications may be due to either GR hypofunction or hyperfunction. Similarly, variations in individual hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness can modulate the type and number of side effects. \\n\\nAside from discontinuation of glucocorticoid medication, potential treatments discussed in the research literature include: \\n\\nanti-glucocorticoids \\n\\npsychoactive drugs that up-regulate the GRII glucocorticoid receptor: \\n\\ntricyclic antidepressants: Desipramine, Imipramine, and Amitriptyline (SSRIs do not ) \\n\\nserotonin antagonists: Ketanserin \\n\\nmood stabilizers: Lithium \\n\\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists \\n\\nglutamate antagonists \\n\\ndehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) \\n\\nsmall molecule brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) analogs \\n\\nstress reduction therapies and exercise. \\n\\nGlucocorticoid medications have been known to be associated with significant side effects involving behavior and mood, regardless of previous psychiatric or cognitive condition, since the early 1950s. But cognitive side effects of steroid medications involving memory and attention are not as widely publicized and may be misdiagnosed as separate conditions, such as attention deficit disorder (ADHD or ADD) in children or early Alzheimer's disease in elderly patients. \\n\\nWolkowitz et al. (2001) presented a 10-year-old male patient, with no prior psychiatric history, who showed significant declines in academic performance that began during a 5-week course of glucocorticoid treatment for acute asthma flare. The medications included prednisone, and methylprednisolone, plus albuterol, beclomethasone, dexamethasone, cromolyn, salmeterol and clarithromycin. Within days of beginning the glucocorticoid treatment, however, the patient began to show symptoms that included major depression, irritability, muscle weakness, and hallucinations ( \\\" stars \\\" or \\\" spots \\\" ). The patient had a fraternal twin brother, and the two previously performed in parallel academically, but following the steroid treatment the patient exhibited poor memory, attention, concentration, insomnia, and avoidance of eye contact. As a result, he began to fall behind his twin brother in academic, developmental, and social areas. The treatment with steroids was stopped and three years later (while still taking buspirone, albuterol, fluticasone and salmeterol inhalers, loratadine and theophylline) the boy showed gradual improvement, but MRI brain scans revealed that the patient's hippocampal volume was 19.5% smaller than that of his twin. His teachers reported continued deficits in memory function, new learning efficiency, verbal reasoning skills, organizational skills, attention, and concentration, deficits which were confirmed by neuropsychological testing; as such, stopping the treatment with steroids brought on a substantial but incomplete relief, the damage being possibly permanent. \\n\\nSacks et al. (2005) reported the case of a 72-year-old man, described as professionally successful, intelligent, and cultivated, with polymyalgia rheumatica, who after being treated with prednisone developed a psychosis and dementia, which several behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry consultants initially diagnosed as early dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Large dosage variations in the patient's medication (including a self-increased dosage from 10 mg/day to as much as 100 mg/day for at least 3 months) produced extreme behavioral changes, from missed appointments to physical altercations, and eventually admission to a psychiatric ward and later to a locked Alzheimer facility. During this time, neuropsychological testing showed a decline in the patient's previously superior IQ as well as deficits in memory, language, fluency, and visuospatial function, which given the patient's age was considered to be compatible with early dementia. When the steroid treatment ended after a year, the patent's confusion and disorganized appearance stopped immediately. Within several weeks, testing showed strong improvement in almost all cognitive functions. His doctors were surprised at the improvement, since the results were inconsistent with a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's. Testing after 14 months showed a large jump in Full Scale IQ from 87 to 124, but mild dysfunction in executive function, memory, attentional control, and verbal/nonverbal memory remained. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-03T16:16:28Z\", \"text_length\": 8016}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Ocular myasthenia\", \"parsed_text\": \"Ocular myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disease of the neuromuscular junction resulting in hallmark variability in muscle weakness and fatigability. MG is an autoimmune disease where anomalous antibodies are produced against the naturally occurring acetylcholine receptors in voluntary muscles. MG may be limited to the muscles of the eye (ocular MG), leading to abrupt onset of weakness/fatigability of the eyelids or eye movement. MG may also involve other muscle groups (generalized MG). \\n\\nAlthough these blocking antibodies may be confined to one of the larger muscles responsible for moving the face or appendages or for breathing, about 90% of MG patients eventually have eye involvement. The most common symptoms are double vision (diplopia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis), whereas the pupil is always spared. Diplopia occurs when MG affects a single extraocular muscle in one eye, limiting eye movement and leading to double vision when the eye is turned toward the affected muscle. Ptosis occurs when the levator palpebrae superioris (the muscle responsible for eyelid elevation) is affected on one or both sides, leading to eyelid drooping. Although these symptoms may not be readily apparent in well-rested patients, weakness can usually be induced with exercise of the commonly affected muscles (e.g. by having the patient look upward for about 60 seconds). \\n\\nIn 75% of MG cases, the initial manifestation is in the eye. Within 2 years, 80% of patients with ocular onset of MG will progress to involve other muscle groups, thereby developing generalized MG. If MG is confined to the ocular muscles for more than 3 years, there is a 94% likelihood that the symptoms will not worsen or generalize. \\n\\nAside from asymmetric ptosis (which becomes worse with fatigue, sustained upgaze, and at the end of the day) and variable limitation of extraocular muscles/diplopia, other clinical signs of ocular MG include gaze-evoked nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, oscillatory motion of the eyeball) and Cogan\\u2019s lid twitch (upper lid twitch present when patient looks straight ahead after looking down for 10\\u201315 seconds). \\n\\nNormally, muscle contraction is a result of electrical signals sent from the central nervous system to muscle fibers via nerve impulses. At the neuromuscular junction, this electrical message is converted into a chemical message as acetylcholine is released from nerve fibers and attaches to corresponding receptors on the muscle fiber. \\n\\nIn MG, antibodies are produced that block acetylcholine receptors, preventing the molecule from binding to the receptor and leading to a breakdown in communication between the nervous system and the muscle, resulting in muscle fatigue, and sometimes paralysis. Autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors are detectable in 70\\u201390% of patients with generalized MG, but only 50% in ocular MG. \\n\\nThe precise reasons for the preferential involvement of eye muscles in MG is not well understood, but there are several lines of thought. \\n\\nFunctional hypotheses propose that although multiple muscles may be affected, a deficit may be more readily apparent in the eyes for several reasons. Slight weakness in a limb may be tolerated, but slight weakness in the extraocular muscles would lead to misalignment of the two eyes, even a small degree of which could lead to diplopia. Eyes may also be less able to adapt to variable weakness, because extraocular muscles use visual rather than proprioceptive (body position-sensing) cues for fine-tuning. \\n\\nImmunologic hypotheses proposes that there may be differences in the antibodies in ocular MG versus generalized MG that may favor the muscles responsible for eye movement and eyelid elevation. \\n\\nPhysiologic hypotheses propose that it is the unique structure and function of extraocular muscles that predispose them to weakness in MG. Compared to extremity muscles, extraocular muscles are smaller, served by more nerve fibers, and are among the fastest contracting muscles in the body. This higher level of activity may predispose them to fatigue in MG. Additionally, some reports indicate that there may be fewer acetylcholine receptors in extraocular muscles versus limb muscles. \\n\\nThe variable course of MG may make the diagnosis difficult. In brief, the diagnosis of MG relies mostly on the patient's history and physical findings, with particular attention to neurologic, eye motility, and eyelid exams. Frequently, patients will describe experiencing alternating ptosis (lid droop in one eye that gets better, then is followed by ptosis in the other eye), as well as diplopia that worsens during the day (with increasing extraocular muscle fatigue). \\n\\nA tensilon (edrophonium chloride) test can be used, which temporarily blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine, and briefly relieves weakness; however, false-negative results are common. Single-fiber electromyography can be used to electrically stimulate single muscle fibers to determine if there is muscle weakness present. The diagnosis of MG can also be confirmed with blood work that measures the amount of blocking antibody present, but only 70% of ocular MG patients have detectable antibody levels. Additional lab and image tests for commonly associated thyroid, thymus and autoimmune diseases are also advisable. \\n\\nThe prognosis tends to be good for patients with MG. It is often best not to treat mild cases of MG. Management necessitates avoidance of medications that can worsen neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, beta-blockers, chloroquine, anti-arrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, some anticonvulsants and intravenous iodinated contrast should be avoided. \\n\\nMG is characteristically variable in course, with the frequency of diplopia and ptosis affected by environmental, emotional and physical factors such as bright sunlight, stress, viral illness, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. Spontaneous remission can occur in any patient and remain for years. In a study of the natural history of generalized MG among 168 patients (with an average follow-up of 12 years), 14% experienced complete remission. \\n\\nPatients with mild-to-moderate ocular myasthenia are usually treated initially with oral anticholinesterase agents, Mestinon (pyridostigmine) being the most commonly employed. There have not been any randomized clinical trials conducted with these agents, and this treatment is often unsuccessful, particularly in resolving diplopia. Immunosuppressive therapy is then started and the agent of choice is usually prednisone. In a small controlled study this drug demonstrated greater efficacy than pyridostigmine. Steroid therapy is controversial, but in another study the results suggested that prednisone does decrease progression to generalized MG. There is no single recommended dosing regimen in light of the side effects commonly associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy, and the difficulty in weaning patients from steroids without exacerbation of symptoms. Response to prednisone therapy is variable. \\n\\nAdditionally, MG patients should be examined for thymomas, and if found, should undergo surgery to address this condition. A prophylactic thymectomy is controversial, but has been shown to be helpful in young MG patients with acute disease within 3 years of disease onset, in patients with enlarged thymus glands and for whom surgery is low-risk, and patients with generalized MG who are unresponsive to medical treatment. \\n\\nThe symptoms of ocular MG can also be addressed by non-medicinal means. Ptosis can be corrected with placement of crutches on eyeglasses and with ptosis tape to elevate eyelid droop. Diplopia can be addressed by occlusion with eye patching, frosted lens, occluding contact lens, or by simply placing opaque tape over a portion of eyeglasses.

      "{\"title\": \"Hedonophobia\", \"parsed_text\": \"Hedonophobia is an excessive fear or aversion to obtaining pleasure. The purported background of some such associated feelings may be due to an egalitarian-related sentiment, whereby one feels a sense of solidarity with individuals in the lowest Human Development Index countries. For others, a recurring thought that some things are too good to be true has resulted in an ingrainedness that they are not entitled to feel too good. Sometimes, it can be triggered by a religious upbringing wherein asceticism is propounded. \\n\\nHedonophobia is formally defined as the fear of experiencing pleasure. 'Hedon' or 'hedone' comes from ancient Greek, meaning 'pleasure' + fear: 'phobia'. Hedonophobia is the inability to enjoy pleasurable experiences, and is often a persistent malady. Diagnosis of the condition is usually related to the age of 'maturity' in each country where the syndrome exists. For instance, in the US a person must be 18 years old to be considered an adult, whereas in Canada he or she must be 18 or 19 years old, depending on the province of residence. Globally, the ages range from (+/-) 12 to 24 years and are mainly determined by traditional ethical practices from previous societies. High anxiety, panic attacks, and extreme fear are symptoms that can result from anticipating pleasure of any kind. Expecting or anticipating pleasure at some point in the future can also trigger an attack. \\n\\nHedonophobics have a type of guilt about feeling pleasure or experiencing pleasurable sensations, due to a cultural background or training (either religious or cultural) that eschews pleasurable pursuits as frivolous or inappropriate. Oftentimes, social guilt is connected to having fun while others are suffering, and is common for those who feel undeserving or have self-worth issues to work through. Also, there is a sense that they shouldn't be given pleasures due to their lack of performance in life, and because they have done things that are deemed \\\" wrong \\\" or \\\" undeserving. \\\" \\n\\nTo determine the depth of the diagnosis for those who suffer from hedonophobia, background is crucial. For example, when a child is taught that a strong work ethic is all that makes them worthy of the good things in life, guilt becomes a motivator to move away from pleasure when they begin to experience it. The individual learns that pleasures are bad, and feeling good is not as sanctified as being empathetic towards those who suffer. \\n\\nC.B.T. (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is an effective approach to the resolution of past beliefs that infiltrate and affect the sufferer's current responses to various situations. Medication is only necessary when there is an interference in the person's normal daily functioning. Various techniques are used by those afflicted with the condition to hide, camouflage or mask their aversion to pleasure. \\n\\nAny relationship that includes things that are pleasurable is re-established when the sufferer learns that he is not worthy of anything pleasurable, or that he only deserves the opposite of those things which are pleasurable. A disconnect is necessary to determine the sufferer's lack of ability to intervene in the overall process. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-26T21:38:15Z\", \"text_length\": 3545}\n",

It is a classical type of organic acidemia. \\n\\nA characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet. This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals. \\n\\nIn about half of cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma. These medical problems are typically severe and can be life-threatening. In the other half of cases, the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time. They are often triggered by an infection or by eating an increased amount of protein-rich foods. \\n\\nThe disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. \\n\\nMutations in both copies of the IVD gene result in isovaleric acidemia. \\n\\nThe enzyme encoded by IVD, isovaleric acid-CoA dehydrogenase (), plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for the third step in processing leucine, an essential amino acid. If a mutation in the IVD gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. As a result, isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to toxic levels, damaging the brain and nervous system. \\n\\nThe urine of newborns can be screened for isovaleric acidemia using mass spectrometry, allowing for early diagnosis. Elevations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma are found. \\n\\nOn 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including isovaleric acidemia. \\n\\nTreatment consists of dietary protein restriction, particularly leucine. During acute episodes, glycine is sometimes given, which conjugates with isovalerate forming isovalerylglycine, or carnitine which has a similar effect. \\n\\nElevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is a clinical biomarker of biotin deficiency. Without biotin, leucine and isoleucine cannot be metabolized normally and results in elevated synthesis of isovaleric acid and consequently 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylglycine, and other isovaleric acid metabolites as well. Elevated serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentrations can be caused by supplementation with 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, genetic conditions, or dietary deficiency of biotin. Some patients with isovaleric acidemia may benefit from supplemental biotin. Biotin deficiency on its own can have severe physiological and cognitive consequences that closely resemble symptoms of organic acidemias. \\n\\nA 2011 review of 176 cases found that diagnoses made early in life (within a few days of birth) were associated with more severe disease and a mortality of 33%.

      "{\"title\": \"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\", \"parsed_text\": \"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart. This weakening may be triggered by emotional stress, such as the death of a loved one, a break-up, rejection from a partner or constant anxiety. This leads to one of the common names, broken heart syndrome. Stress cardiomyopathy is now a well-recognized cause of acute congestive heart failure, lethal abnormal heart rhythms, and rupture of the heart wall. \\n\\nA sudden massive surge of catecholamines such as adrenaline and norepinephrine from extreme stress or a tumor secreting these chemicals is thought to play a central role. This adrenaline surge triggers the arteries to tighten, thereby raising blood pressure and placing more stress on the heart, and may lead to spasm of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This impairs the arteries from delivering adequate blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. Together, these events can lead to congestive heart failure and decrease the heart's output of blood with each squeeze. \\n\\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs worldwide. The condition is thought to be responsible for 2% of all acute coronary syndrome cases presenting to hospitals. Although TTS has generally been considered a benign disease, contemporary observations show that the rates of cardiogenic shock and death in TTS are comparable to those of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. \\n\\nIt occurs more commonly in postmenopausal women. The name \\\" takotsubo \\\" comes from the Japanese word ' \\\" octopus trap \\\" , because the left ventricle of the heart takes on a shape resembling an octopus trap when affected by this condition. \\n\\nThe typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes mimicking a myocardial infarction of the anterior wall. During the course of evaluation of the patient, a bulging out of the left ventricular apex with a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle is often noted. It is the hallmark bulging-out of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name takotsubo \\\" octopus trap \\\", in Japan, where it was first described. \\n\\nStress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with more than 85% of cases set in motion by either a physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms. Examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of a loved one, fear of public speaking, arguing with a spouse, relationship disagreements, betrayal, and financial problems. Acute asthma, surgery, chemotherapy, and stroke are examples of physical stressors. In a few cases, the stress may be a happy event, such as a wedding, winning a jackpot, a sporting triumph, or a birthday. \\n\\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women. Often there is a history of a recent severe (usually negative, sometimes happy) emotional or physical stress. \\n\\nThe cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed. \\n\\nTransient vasospasm: Some of the original researchers of takotsubo suggested that multiple simultaneous spasms of coronary arteries could cause enough loss of blood flow to cause transient stunning of the myocardium. Other researchers have shown that vasospasm is much less common than initially thought. It has been noted that when there are vasospasms, even in multiple arteries, that they do not correlate with the areas of myocardium that are not contracting. \\n\\nMicrovascular dysfunction: The theory gaining the most traction is that there is dysfunction of the coronary arteries at the level where they are no longer visible by coronary angiography. This could include microvascular vasospasm, however, it may well have some similarities to diseases such as diabetes mellitus. In such disease conditions the microvascular arteries fail to provide adequate oxygen to the myocardium. \\n\\nMid-ventricular obstruction, apical stunning: It has been suggested that a mid-ventricular wall thickening with outflow obstruction is important in the pathophysiology. \\n\\nCatecholamine-induced myocyte injury:' It has been suggested that the response to catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, released in response to stress) leads to heart muscle dysfunction that contributes to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. \\n\\nIt is likely that there are multiple factors at play that could include some amount of vasospasm and a failure of the microvasculature \\n\\nCase series looking at large groups of patients report that some patients develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an emotional stress, while others have a preceding clinical stressor (such as an asthma attack or sudden illness). Roughly one-third of patients have no preceding stressful event. A 2009 large case series from Europe found that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was slightly more frequent during the winter season. This may be related to two possible/suspected pathophysiological causes: coronary spasms of microvessels, which are more prevalent in cold weather, and viral infections \\u2013 such as Parvovirus B19 \\u2013 which occur more frequently during the winter. \\n\\nA 2019 case involved a 60 year-old woman presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to over-consumption of wasabi, mistaking it for avocado. \\n\\nTransient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is found in 1.7\\u20132.2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. While the original case studies reported on individuals in Japan, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted more recently in the United States and Western Europe. It is likely that the syndrome previously went undiagnosed before it was described in detail in the Japanese literature. Evaluation of individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically includes a coronary angiogram to rule out occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, which will not reveal any significant blockages that would cause the left ventricular dysfunction. Provided that the individual survives their initial presentation, the left ventricular function improves within two months. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult upon presentation. The ECG findings often are confused with those found during an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. It classically mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and is characterised by acute onset of transient ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities (ballooning) accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion or QT-interval prolongation on ECG. Cardiac enzymes are usually negative and are moderate at worst, and cardiac catheterization usually shows absence of significant coronary artery disease. \\n\\nThe diagnosis is made by the pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities, in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic. This is accompanied by the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities. Although apical ballooning has been described classically as the angiographic manifestation of takotsubo, it has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome includes not only the classic apical ballooning, but also different angiographic morphologies such as mid-ventricular ballooning and, rarely, local ballooning of other segments. \\n\\nThe ballooning patterns were classified by Shimizu et al. as takotsubo type for apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia, reverse takotsubo for basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia, mid-ventricular type for mid-ventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia, and localised type for any other segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of takotsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction. \\n\\nIn short, the main criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are: the patient must have experienced a stressor before the symptoms began to arise; the patient's ECG reading must show abnormalities from a normal heart; the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles; the levels of cardiac enzymes in the heart must be elevated or irregular; and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in a short amount of time. \\n\\n<gallery> \\n\\nFile:Takotsubo ventriculography.gif|Left ventriculography during systole showing apical ballooning akinesis with basal hyperkinesis in a characteristic takotsubo ventricle \\n\\nFile:Takotsubo left ventriculogram.jpg|Left ventriculogram during systole displaying the characteristic apical ballooning with apical motionlessness in a patient with takotsubo cardiomyopathy \\n\\nFile:Takotsubo ultrasound.gif|(A) Echocardiogram showing dilatation of the left ventricle in the acute phase (B) Resolution of left ventricular function on repeat echocardiogram six days later \\n\\nFile:Takotsubo ECG.JPEG|ECG showing sinus tachycardia and non-specific ST and T wave changes from a person with confirmed takotsubo cardiomyopathy \\n\\nFile:UOTW 74 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Echocardiogram showing the effects of the disease \\n\\n</gallery> \\n\\nThe treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive in nature, for it is considered a transient disorder. Treatment is dependent on whether patients experience heart failure or acute hypotension and shock. In many individuals, left ventricular function normalizes within two months. Aspirin and other heart drugs also appear to help in the treatment of this disease, even in extreme cases. After the patient has been diagnosed, and myocardial infarction (heart attack) ruled out, the aspirin regimen may be discontinued, and treatment becomes that of supporting the patient. \\n\\nWhile medical treatments are important to address the acute symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, further treatment includes lifestyle changes. It is important that the individual stay physically healthy while learning and maintaining methods to manage stress, and to cope with future difficult situations. \\n\\nAlthough the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually go away on their own and the condition completely resolves itself within a few weeks, some serious complications can happen that must be treated. These most commonly include congestive heart failure and very low blood pressure, and less commonly include blood clotting in the apex of the left ventricle, irregular heart beat, and tearing of the heart wall. \\n\\nFor patients in acute heart failure, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers, are considered mainstays of heart failure treatment. But use of beta blockers specifically for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is controversial, because they may confer no benefit. \\n\\nFor people with cardiogenic shock, medical treatment is based on whether a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present. Therefore, early echocardiography is necessary to determine proper management. For those with obstructed LVOTs inotropic agents should not be used, but instead should be managed like patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, (e.g. phenylephrine and fluid resuscitation). For cases in which the LVOT is not obstructed, inotropic therapy (e.g. dobutamine and dopamine) may be used, but with the consideration that takotsubo is caused by excess catecholamines. \\n\\nFurthermore, mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is well-established as supportive treatment. \\n\\nDespite the grave initial presentation in some of the patients, most of the patients survive the initial acute event, with a very low rate of in-hospital mortality or complications. Once a patient has recovered from the acute stage of the syndrome, they can expect a favorable outcome and the long-term prognosis is excellent. Even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation, it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months. Although infrequent, recurrence of the syndrome has been reported and seems to be associated with the nature of the trigger. \\n\\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare, affecting between 1.2% and 2.2% of people in Japan and 2% to 3% in Western countries who suffer a myocardial infarction. It also affects far more women than men with 90% of cases being women, most postmenopausal. Scientists believe one reason is that estrogen causes the release of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in response to mental stress. It is not likely for the same recovered patient to experience the syndrome twice, although it has happened in rare cases. The average ages at onset are between 58 and 75 years. Less than 3% of cases occurred in patients under age 50. \\n\\nRees, et al. wrote in 1967 that the death of a close relative increases the risk of dying within one year by a factor of seven. \\n\\nEngel wrote about sudden and rapid death during psychological stress in 1971 and itemized 8 causation categories: [1] on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person; [2] during acute grief; [3] on threat of loss of a close person; [4] during mourning or on an anniversary; [5] on loss of status or self-esteem; [6] personal danger or threat of injury; [7] after the danger is over; [8] reunion, triumph, or happy ending. He proposed these events provoke neurovegetative responses, involving both the flight-fight and conservation-withdrawal systems, conducive to lethal cardiac events, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease. \\n\\nAlthough the first scientific description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not until the 1990s, Cebelin and Hirsch wrote about human stress cardiomyopathy in 1980. The two looked at homicidal assaults that had happened in Cuyahoga County, Ohio the past 30 years, specifically those with autopsies who had no internal injury, but had died of physical assault. They found that 11 of 15 had myofibrillar degeneration similar to animal stress studies. In the end, they concluded their data supported \\\" the theory of catecholamine mediation of these myocardial changes in man and of the lethal potential of stress through its effect on the heart \\\" . \\n\\nThe first studied case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was in Japan in 1991 by Sato et al. More cases of the syndrome appeared in Japan within the next decade, although western medicine had still not acknowledged it. The syndrome finally occurred in 1997 when Pavin et al. wrote about two cases of \\\" reversible LV dysfunction precipitated by acute emotional stress. \\\" The western world had not heard of such a thing at the time, as it was incredibly rare and often misdiagnosed. The Japanese at last reported about the syndrome to the west in 2001 under the name \\\" transient LV apical ballooning \\\" though at this point the west had already heard of numerous cases. The syndrome reached international audiences through the media in 2005 when the New England Journal of Medicine'' wrote about the syndrome. \\n\\nTakotsubo website \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-21T00:40:33Z\", \"text_length\": 17981}\n",

FXII appears to be not essential for blood clotting, as individuals with this condition are usually asymptomatic and form blood clots in vivo. FXII deficiency tends to be identified during presurgical laboratory screening for bleeding disorders. \\n\\nThe condition can be inherited or acquired. \\n\\nWhile it is indicated that people with FXII deficiency are generally asymptomatic, studies in women with recurrent miscarriages suggest an association with FXII deficiency. The condition is of importance in the differential diagnosis to other bleeding disorders, specifically the hemophilias: hemophilia A with a deficiency in factor VIII or antihemophilic globulin, hemophilia B with a deficiency in factor IX (Christmas disease), and hemophilia C with a deficiency in factor XI. Other rare forms of bleeding disorders are also in the differential diagnosis. \\n\\nThere is concern that individuals with FXII deficiency are more prone to thrombophilic disease, however, this is at variance with a long term study from Switzerland. \\n\\nInherited or congenital FX deficiency is usually passed on by autosomal recessive inheritance.

People who have only one defective gene are asymptomatic, but may have lower FXII levels and can pass the gene on to half their offspring. \\n\\nIn persons with congenital FXII deficiency the condition is lifelong.

      "{\"title\": \"Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome\", \"parsed_text\": \"Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS), also known as infantile parkinsonism-dystonia, is a rare movement disorder that causes progressively worsening dystonia and parkinsonism. It is the first known inherited dopamine 'transportophathy.' \\n\\nDTDS is an extremely rare disease; only about 20 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature. Researchers believe this condition is likely underdiagnosed because its signs and symptoms overlap with other movement disorders, including cerebral palsy. \\n\\nThe onset of DTDS is a continuum that ranges from early-onset DTDS (in the first 6 months) to atypical later-onset DTDS (in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood). \\n\\nThe main symptom of DTDS, presenting in 80-99% of DTDS patients, is Parkinsonism. This is a neurological anomaly resulting from degeneration of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, and is characterized by shaking and tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking and gait. \\n\\nVarious other symptoms present less commonly (30-79%), including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), acid reflux, muscular hypertonia, and chorea. \\n\\nDTDS is caused by mutations in the SLC6A3 gene, which codes for the dopamine transporter protein DAT. In contrast to various mutations that up-regulate DAT activity, which is implicated in clinical depression, this mutation results in DAT down-regulation and, consequently, DTDS. Known DTDS-related SLC6A3 mutations include: \\n\\nR85L \\n\\nA314V \\n\\nG386R \\n\\nR445C \\n\\nY470S \\n\\nIn vitro replication of SLC6A3 mutations like those present in DTDS demonstrate multifaceted loss of dopamine transporter functions. Dopamine intake is universally impaired. These mutants also demonstrated diminished dopamine binding affinity, reduced cell surface transporter, loss of post-translational dopamine transporter glycosylation, and failure of amphetamine-mediated dopamine efflux. \\n\\nThe age at which signs and symptoms appear seems to be related to the severity of DAT dysfunction. Early-onset DTDS movement problems in infancy most often have transporter activity that is less than 5 percent of normal. Those whose movement problems appear in childhood or later tend to have somewhat higher levels of transporter activity, although they are still lower than normal. Researchers speculate that higher levels of transporter activity may delay the onset of the disease in these individuals. \\n\\nDTDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means, for affected individuals, both copies of the gene in each cell have SLC6A3 mutations. As such, each sibling of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once a SLC6A3 pathogenic variant is identified within an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis for pregnancies can be options considered for genetic counseling. \\n\\nDiagnosis of SLC6A3-negative DTDS is established in a proband via molecular genetic testing, looking for biallelic (i.e. homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic SLC6A3 variants. DTDS-positive patients are further identified by matching their genetic testing results with known characteristic clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. \\n\\nTo date, another potential diagnostic tool is neurotransmitter analysis of patient cerebrospinal fluid. All individuals tested with classical early-onset, SLC6A3-related DTDS display raised homovanillic acid (HVA) levels with normal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite) levels. DTDS patients demonstrate a HVA:5-HIAA ratio of 5.0-13.0, above the normal range of 1.0-4.0. In addition, the patients have normal pterin profiles. \\n\\nMutant constructs of human dopamine transporter can be used for in vitro functional analysis of any particular mutant's dopamine uptake and cocaine-analogue binding. \\n\\nA multidisciplinary approach to long-term management of this progressive disorder is optimal. Treatment can be split into three categories: treatment of DTDS manifestations, prevention of secondary complications, and monitoring of overall disease progression. \\n\\nTreatment to control the chorea and dyskinesia in the early stages of DTDS is done with tetrabenazine and benzodiazepines. The dystonia is more difficult to control and the first-line agents include pramipexole and ropinirole; adjuncts include trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, gabapentin, and clonidine for severe dystonia, and chloral hydrate and benzodiazepines for exacerbations of dystonia or status dystonicus. \\n\\nRegular physiotherapy is recommended to reduce the risk of contractures, shortening and hardening of the muscles. Feeding may become difficult and alternative feeding strategies including nasogastric tubes or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies may become necessary due to progressive bulbar dysfunction. The influenza vaccine is used in combination with prophylactic antibiotics to prevent chest infections. \\n\\nPatients are evaluated every six to 12 months for early evidence of hip dislocation and spinal deforities. Risk of pulmonary aspiration is evaluated with regular swallowing assessments. Nutritional assessments are performed regularly to ensure adequate caloric intake. \\n\\nPreliminary experiments have examined the potential of drugs to act as pharmacological chaperones of DAT to rescue DTDS mutations. Bupropion and ibogaine appear to promote DAT maturation and functional activity by acting as pharmacological chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum. These two drugs rescue DAT maturation and functional activity of two DTDS-associated mutations (A314V and R445C). \\n\\nA variety of support and advocacy groups exist to connect with other patients and families or provide valuable services. \\n\\nInternational Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society \\n\\nParkinson & Movement Disorder Alliance \\n\\nParkinson's Foundation \\n\\nPediatric Neurotransmitter Disease Association \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-16T23:40:56Z\", \"text_length\": 6815}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato\", \"parsed_text\": \"Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato refers to a group of bacteria species within the Helicobacter genus. The Helicobacter genus consists of at least 40 species of spiral-shaped (also described as corkscrew-shaped) flagellated, Gram-negative bacteria of which the by far most prominent and well-known species is Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori is associated with the development of gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori has also been associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. \\n\\nThe Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato species of helicobacter bacteria take as part of their definition a similarity to H. pylori in being associated with the development of stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lypmhomas, and extrnodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. It is important to recognize and diagnose the association of Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato with these upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, particularly extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because many of them have been successfully treated using antibiotic-based drug regimens directed against the instigating Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato bacterial species. \\n\\nThe current taxonomy of Helicobacter bacteria is a bit complex and incomplete with new species currently being considered as possibly belonging to the Helicobactor genus. Within the Helicobacter genus, Helicobacter heilmannii are a group of Helicobacter species that are distinguished from H. pylori by being 2- to 3-fold larger in size (they are 4-10 micrometers in length and 0.5-0.8 micrometers in width while H. pylor are 2.5-4 micrometers in length and 0.5-1.0 micrometers in width) as well as in the position and noumber of their flagella (they have 4-23 flagella which are located at only one of their ends while H. pylori have 4-8 flagella which are divided between both of their ends). The Helcobacter heilmannii grouping of bacteria is further divided into two groups: Helicobacter heilmanii sensu stricto (H. heilmanni s.s.) and Helicobacter heilmani sensu lato (H. heilmanni s.l.). H. heilmanni s.l. are Helicobacter heilmannii bacteria species that have been isolated from the stomachs of humans and animals but identified only on the basis of their histopathological appearance, electron microscopic appearance, and/or other crude taxonomic data: in most studies, the species of these Helicobacter heilmannii bacteria is not defined other than that they are non-H. pylori isolated from the stomachs of humans and animals. H. heilmanni s.l. is a clinically useful designation indicating unidentified H. pylori species of Helicobacer heilmannii that, like H. pylori, can cause upper gastrointestinal tract diseases in humans and are sensitive to a common set of antibiotic regimens. H. heilmanni s.s., in contrast, are Helicobacter heilmannii isolates whose species have been clearly defined, typically by unambiguous molecular biology methods. \\n\\nMost clinical studies have not identified the exact species of Helicobacter heilmanii associated with upper gastrointestinal tract disease and therefore designated these bacterial species as H. heilmanni s.l. However, investigative studies have identified these species in some patients with H. heilmanni s.l.-associated stomach diseases. The H. heilmanni s.s. species identified to date in the stomachs of humans with these upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, the natural hosts for these species, the sites these species colonize in their natural, non-human hosts, and each species prevalence as a percentage of all H.heilmanii s.s. species isolated from humans are given in the following Table. \\n\\nH. heilmanni s.s species identified in the stomachs of patients with H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases Non-human natural hosts Colonized sites in non-humans hosts Prevalence in humans \\n\\nHelicobacter bizzozeronii cat, dog, fox, lynx stomach, dog saliva 4% \\n\\nHelicobacter felis cat, dog, rabbit, cheetah stomach 15% \\n\\nHelicobacter salomonis cat, dog, rabbit stomach, dog saliva 21% \\n\\nHelicobacter suis pig, non-human primates stomach 14%-37% \\n\\nHelicobacter heilmannii s.s <sup> 1 </sup> cat dog, fox, lyrnx, non-human primates stomach 8% \\n\\n#Helicobacter heilmannii s.s. is a species in the Helicobacter heilmanii group; the appended \\\" s.s \\\" . abbreviation is used to indicate that it refers to a specific species rather than the Helicobacter heilmannii group. \\n\\nMany reports suggest that individuals, including children, acquire H. heilmanni s.l. infections by close contact with cats, dogs, pigs, and other farm animals as well as by eating raw pork contaminated by H. suis. The H. heilmanni s.s. species listed in the above table have been isolated from these animals while H. suis has been isolated from fresh raw pork (H. suis remains viable for up to 48\\u201372 hours in fresh raw pork). Furthermore, there is a higher rate of H. heilmanni s.l.-associated infections in rural areas. These findings suggest that the H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases are zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. \\n\\nH. heilmanni s.l. has been detected in the stomach of patients with acute and chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease of the stomach and duodenum, non-lymphoma types of stomach cancers, and extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the stomach. Based on the ability of antibiotic-based drug regimens to improve and cure some of these diseases in humans and animal models, H. heilmanni s.l. infections are considered to be key contributes in their development and/or progression. H. pylori is far more often involved in these diseases: H. heilmanni s.l. is typically associated with <1% of all Helicobacter-induced upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, while H. pylori is associated with the remaining cases. In certain Asian countries, however, H. heilmanni s.l. appears to be associated with higher percentages of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases; for example, it is associated with 4% and 6.2%, respectively, of all Helicobacter-associated diseases in China and Thailand. \\n\\nThe treatment of patients with H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases has employed the same antibiotic-based drug regiments that have been successfully used to treat and cure H. pylori-associated diseases. These regimens have eradicated the H. heilmanni s.l. bacterium in the stomach to achieve symptomatic relief and total regression of some of the infection-associated non-malignant as well as malignant diseases, particularly extranodal marginal B-cell lymphoma. Drug regimens of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor have been used to treat S. heilmani s.l.-associated upper gastrointestinal tract diseases successfully. \\n\\nHelicobacter \\n\\nHelicobacter pylori'' \\n\\nMarginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the stomach \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-11-26T13:58:40Z\", \"text_length\": 8664}\n",

It is defined as lasting from 2.0 seconds to several minutes. Since the heart contains multiple pacemakers, this interruption of the cardiac cycle generally lasts only a few seconds before another part of the heart, such as the atrio-ventricular junction or the ventricles, begins pacing and restores the heart action. This condition can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a brief period of irregular length with no electrical activity before either the sinoatrial node resumes normal pacing, or another pacemaker begins pacing. If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm. If no other pacemaker begins pacing during an episode of sinus arrest it becomes a cardiac arrest. This condition is sometimes confused with sinoatrial block, a condition in which the pacing impulse is generated, but fails to conduct through the myocardium.

Temporal arteritis is an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels that happens especially with advancing age. AAION occurs in about 15-20 percent of patients with temporal arteritis. Damage to the blood vessels supplying the optic nerves leads to insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the nerve and subsequent optic nerve fiber death. Most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss first to one eye. If the temporal arteritis is left untreated, the fellow eye will likely suffer vision loss as well within 1\\u20132 weeks.

Most infections are asymptomatic. Manifestations may include abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss. Vitamin B12 deficiency with subsequent megaloblastic anemia may occur, but has not for several decades in D. latum infections, possibly because of improved nutrition. In one test, nearly half of the ingested vitamin was absorbed by D. latum in otherwise healthy patients, while 80\\u2013100% was absorbed by the worm in patients with anemia. It is not known why anemia occurs in some cases but not others. Massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. Migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis. \\n\\nFemales cases are disproportionately reported, most likely due to the higher likelihood for them to be involved in meal preparation, rather than any morphological differences. \\n\\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in the stool is the basis of specific diagnosis. Eggs are usually numerous and can be demonstrated without concentration techniques. Examination of proglottids passed in the stool is also of diagnostic value. \\n\\nDiagnostic tool: \\n\\nMicroscopy \\n\\nMorphologic comparison with other intestinal parasites \\n\\nThough it is difficult to identify the eggs or proglottids to the species level, the distinction is of little medical importance because, like most adult tapeworms in the intestine, all members of this genus respond to the same drugs. \\n\\nAvoid ingestion of raw freshwater fish. Adequate cooking or freezing of freshwater fish will kill the encysted fish tapeworm larvae. Also, because human feces is an important mechanism for spreading eggs, proper disposal of sewage can cut down on infection of fish and thus of humans. \\n\\nUpon diagnosis, treatment is quite simple and effective. The standard treatment for diphyllobothriasis, as well as many other tapeworm infections is a single dose of praziquantel, 5\\u201310 mg/kg orally once for both adults and children. An alternative treatment is niclosamide, 2 g orally once for adults or 50 mg/kg (max 2 g) for children. Praziquantel is not FDA-approved for this indication and niclosamide is not available for human or even animal use in the United States. Reportedly, albendazole can also be effective. Another interesting potential diagnostic tool and treatment is the contrast medium, Gastrografin, introduced into the duodenum, which allows both visualization of the parasite, and has also been shown to cause detachment and passing of the whole worm. \\n\\nDiphyllobothriasis occurs in areas where lakes and rivers coexist with human consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish. Such areas are found in Europe, newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, North America, Asia, Uganda, Peru (because of ceviche), and Chile. Diphyllobothriasis nihonkaiense was once endemic to coastal provinces of central and northern Japan, where salmon fisheries thrived. In recent decades, regions with endemic diphyllobothriasis nihonkaiense have disappeared from Japan, though cases continue to be reported among urbanites who consume sushi or sashimi. In Kyoto, it is estimated that the average incidence in the past 20 years was 0.32 cases per 100,000 population per year, and that in 2008 was 1.0 case per 100,000 population, suggesting that D. nihonkaiense infection is equally as prevalent in Japan as D. latum is in some European countries. \\n\\nThe disease is rare in the United States.

      "{\"title\": \"Psychopathy\", \"parsed_text\": \"Psychopathy is traditionally a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. It is sometimes considered synonymous with sociopathy. Different conceptions of psychopathy have been used throughout history that are only partly overlapping and may sometimes be contradictory. \\n\\nHervey M. Cleckley, an American psychiatrist, influenced the initial diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality reaction/disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as did American psychologist George E. Partridge. The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder (DPD) respectively, stating that these diagnoses have been referred to (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy. The creation of ASPD and DPD was driven by the fact that many of the classic traits of psychopathy were impossible to measure objectively. Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his Psychopathy Checklist. \\n\\nAlthough no psychiatric or psychological organization has sanctioned a diagnosis titled \\\" psychopathy \\\" , assessments of psychopathic characteristics are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations and may have important consequences for individuals. The study of psychopathy is an active field of research, and the term is also used by the general public, popular press, and in fictional portrayals. While the term is often employed in common usage along with \\\" crazy \\\" , \\\" insane \\\" , and \\\" mentally ill \\\" , there is a categorical difference between psychosis and psychopathy. \\n\\nA person suffering from a chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior. \\n\\nThere are multiple conceptualizations of psychopathy, including Cleckleyan psychopathy (Hervey Cleckley's conception entailing bold, disinhibited behavior, and \\\" feckless disregard \\\" ) and criminal psychopathy (a meaner, more aggressive and disinhibited conception explicitly entailing persistent and sometimes serious criminal behavior). The latter conceptualization is typically used as the modern clinical concept and assessed by the Psychopathy Checklist. The label \\\" psychopath \\\" may have implications and stigma related to decisions about punishment severity for criminal acts, medical treatment, civil commitments, etc. Efforts have therefore been made to clarify the meaning of the term. \\n\\nThe triarchic model suggests that different conceptions of psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to various degrees. Analyses have been made with respect to the applicability of measurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) to this model. \\n\\nBoldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness. The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond to differences in the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear. \\n\\nDisinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in frontal lobe systems that are involved in such control. \\n\\nMeanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close attachments, use of cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of authority, and destructive excitement seeking. The PCL-R in general is related to this but in particular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to PPI, but also includes elements of subscales in Impulsive antisociality. \\n\\nAn early and influential analysis from Harris and colleagues indicated that a discrete category, or taxon, may underlie PCL-R psychopathy, allowing it to be measured and analyzed. However, this was only found for the behavioral Factor 2 items they identified, child problem behaviors; adult criminal behavior did not support the existence of a taxon. Marcus, John, and Edens more recently performed a series of statistical analyses on PPI scores and concluded that psychopathy may best be conceptualized as having a \\\" dimensional latent structure \\\" like depression. \\n\\nMarcus et al. repeated the study on a larger sample of prisoners, using the PCL-R and seeking to rule out other experimental or statistical issues that may have produced the previously different findings. They again found that the psychopathy measurements do not appear to be identifying a discrete type (a taxon). They suggest that while for legal or other practical purposes an arbitrary cut-off point on trait scores might be used, there is actually no clear scientific evidence for an objective point of difference by which to label some people \\\" psychopaths \\\" ; in other words, a \\\" psychopath \\\" may be more accurately described as someone who is \\\" relatively psychopathic \\\" . \\n\\nThe PCL-R was developed for research, not clinical forensic diagnosis, and even for research purposes to improve understanding of the underlying issues, it is necessary to examine dimensions of personality in general rather than only a constellation of traits. \\n\\nStudies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such as antagonism (high), conscientiousness (low) and anxiousness (low). \\n\\nPsychopathy has also been linked to high psychoticism\\u2014a theorized dimension referring to tough, aggressive or hostile tendencies. Aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility, impulsivity, sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression. \\n\\nOtto Kernberg, from a particular psychoanalytic perspective, believed psychopathy should be considered as part of a spectrum of pathological narcissism, that would range from narcissistic personality on the low end, malignant narcissism in the middle, and psychopathy at the high end. \\n\\nPsychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism, three personality traits that are together referred to as the dark triad, share certain characteristics, such as a callous-manipulative interpersonal style. The dark tetrad refers to these traits with the addition of sadism. \\n\\nThe current conceptions of psychopathy have been criticized for being poorly conceptualized, highly subjective, and encompassing a wide variety of underlying disorders. Dorothy Otnow Lewis has written \\n\\nHalf of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist consists of symptoms of mania, hypomania, and frontal-lobe dysfunction, which frequently results in underlying disorders being dismissed. Hare's conception of psychopathy has also been criticized for being reductionist, dismissive, tautological, and ignorant of context as well as the dynamic nature of human behavior. Some have called for rejection of the concept altogether, due to its vague, subjective and judgmental nature that makes it prone to misuse. \\n\\nSocially, psychopathy expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development. \\n\\nIn terms of simple correlations, the PCL-R manual states an average score of 22.1 has been found in North American prisoner samples, and that 20.5% scored 30 or higher. An analysis of prisoner samples from outside North America found a somewhat lower average value of 17.5. Studies have found that psychopathy scores correlated with repeated imprisonment, detention in higher security, disciplinary infractions, and substance misuse. \\n\\nPsychopathy, as measured with the PCL-R in institutional settings, shows in meta-analyses small to moderate effect sizes with institutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent crime with similar effects for the three outcomes. Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime. \\n\\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and violence, and the PCL-R emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior. Researchers, however, have noted that psychopathy is dissociable from and not synonymous with violence. \\n\\nIt has been suggested that psychopathy is associated with \\\" instrumental \\\" , also known as predatory, proactive, or \\\" cold blooded \\\" aggression, a form of aggression characterized by reduced emotion and conducted with a goal differing from but facilitated by the commission of harm. One conclusion in this regard was made by a 2002 study of homicide offenders, which reported that the homicides committed by homicidal offenders with psychopathy were almost always (93.3%) primarily instrumental, significantly more than the proportion (48.4%) of those committed by non-psychopathic homicidal offenders, with the instrumentality of the homicide also correlated with the total PCL-R score of the offender as well as their scores on the Factor 1 \\\" interpersonal-affective \\\" dimension. However, contrary to the equating of this to mean exclusively \\\" in cold blood \\\" , more than a third of the homicides committed by psychopathic offenders involved some component of emotional reactivity as well. In any case, FBI profilers indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense, and some research supports this, at least with regard to sexual offending. One study has found more serious offending by non-psychopathic offenders on average than by offenders with psychopathy (e.g. more homicides versus more armed robbery and property offenses) and another that the Affective facet of the PCL-R predicted reduced offense seriousness. \\n\\nStudies on perpetrators of domestic violence find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy, with the prevalence estimated to be at around 15-30%. Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the PCL-R, which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and exploitative interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to the types of psychosocial interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators. \\n\\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence risk assessment. A large systematic review and meta-regression found that the PCL performed the poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence. In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores. Nonetheless, the PCL-R may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it. \\n\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that psychopathic behavior is consistent with traits common to some serial killers, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and predatory behavior. It has also been found that the homicide victims of psychopathic offenders were disproportionately female in comparison to the more equitable gender distribution of victims of non-psychopathic offenders. \\n\\nPsychopathy has been associated with commission of sexual crime, with some researchers arguing that it is correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior. A 2011 study of conditional releases for Canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non-violent offences but not more sexual offences. For child molesters, psychopathy was associated with more offences. A study on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers, in which 84.2% of the sample had PCL-R scores above 20 and 47.4% above 30, found that 82.4% of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence (defined as enjoyment indicated by self-report or evidence) compared to 52.6% of those with scores below 30, and total PCL-R and Factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence. Despite this, it is reported that offenders with psychopathy (both sexual and non-sexual offenders) are about 2.5 times more likely to be granted conditional release compared to non-psychopathic offenders. \\n\\nIn considering the issue of possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non-offending parent and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher, then they should be excluded from any consideration of being placed in a home with children under any circumstances. There is, however, increasing concern that PCL scores are too inconsistent between different examiners, including in its use to evaluate sex offenders. \\n\\nThe possibility of psychopathy has been associated with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism. \\n\\nIt may be that a significant portion of people with the disorder are socially successful and tend to express their antisocial behavior through more covert avenues such as social manipulation or white collar crime. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as \\\" successful psychopaths \\\" , and may not necessarily always have extensive histories of traditional antisocial behavior as characteristic of traditional psychopathy. \\n\\nThe PCL:YV is an adaptation of the PCL-R for individuals aged 13\\u201318 years. It is, like the PCL-R, done by a trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records. The \\\" Antisocial Process Screening Device \\\" (APSD) is also an adaptation of the PCL-R. It can be administered by parents or teachers for individuals aged 6\\u201313 years. High psychopathy scores for both juveniles, as measured with these instruments, and adults, as measured with the PCL-R and other measurement tools, have similar associations with other variables, including similar ability in predicting violence and criminality. Juvenile psychopathy may also be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger, hostility, anxiety, and depression. Psychopathic traits in youth typically comprise three factors: callous/unemotional, narcissism, and impulsivity/irresponsibility. \\n\\nThere is positive correlation between early negative life events of the ages 0\\u20134 and the emotion-based aspects of psychopathy. There are moderate to high correlations between psychopathy rankings from late childhood to early adolescence. The correlations are considerably lower from early- or mid-adolescence to adulthood. In one study most of the similarities were on the Impulsive- and Antisocial-Behavior scales. Of those adolescents who scored in the top 5% highest psychopathy scores at age 13, less than one third (29%) were classified as psychopathic at age 24. Some recent studies have also found poorer ability at predicting long-term, adult offending. \\n\\nConduct disorder is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behavior in childhood and/or adolescence, and may be seen as a precursor to ASPD. Some researchers have speculated that there are two subtypes of conduct disorder which mark dual developmental pathways to adult psychopathy. The DSM allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10 and adolescent onset at age 10 and later. Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime referred to as \\\" life-course- persistent \\\" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior. \\n\\nIt has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model. \\n\\nThe DSM-5 includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a callous, unemotional interpersonal style across multiple settings and relationships. The specifier is based on research which suggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe form of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy and increased boldness and/or meanness in the triarchic model. \\n\\nDysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala regions of the brain have been associated with specific learning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury, including damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled \\\" psychopathic individuals \\\" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus-reinforced learning in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their uncinate fasciculus\\u2014white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence from DT-MRI, of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas. \\n\\nAlthough some studies have suggested inverse relationships between psychopathy and intelligence, including with regards to verbal IQ, Hare and Neumann state that a large literature demonstrates at most only a weak association between psychopathy and IQ, noting that the early pioneer Cleckley included good intelligence in his checklist due to selection bias (since many of his patients were \\\" well educated and from middle-class or upper-class backgrounds \\\" ) and that \\\" there is no obvious theoretical reason why the disorder described by Cleckley or other clinicians should be related to intelligence; some psychopaths are bright, others less so \\\" . Studies also indicate that different aspects of the definition of psychopathy (e.g. interpersonal, affective (emotion), behavioral and lifestyle components) can show different links to intelligence, and the result can depend on the type of intelligence assessment (e.g. verbal, creative, practical, analytical). \\n\\nA large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. The overall pattern of results across studies indicates that people diagnosed with psychopathy demonstrate reduced MRI, fMRI, aMRI, PET, and SPECT activity in areas of the brain. Research has also shown that an approximate 18% smaller amygdala size contributes to a significantly lower emotional sensation in regards to fear, sadness, amongst other negative emotions, which may likely be the reason as to why psychopathic individuals have lower empathy. Some recent fMRI studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives). Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. Meta-analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions (i.e., not only fear and sadness) in both adults and children/adolescents. \\n\\nPsychopathy has been associated with amorality\\u2014an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for moral beliefs. There are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment. Studies of developmental level (sophistication) of moral reasoning found all possible results\\u2014lower, higher or the same as non-psychopaths. Studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-psychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less severe. \\n\\nA study comparing judgments of whether personal or impersonal harm would be endorsed in order to achieve the rationally maximum (utilitarian) amount of welfare found no significant differences between subjects high and low in psychopathy. However, a further study using the same tests found that prisoners scoring high on the PCL were more likely to endorse impersonal harm or rule violations than non-psychopathic controls were. The psychopathic offenders who scored low in anxiety were also more willing to endorse personal harm on average. \\n\\nAssessing accidents, where one person harmed another unintentionally, psychopaths judged such actions to be more morally permissible. This result has been considered a reflection of psychopaths' failure to appreciate the emotional aspect of the victim's harmful experience. \\n\\nBehavioral genetic studies have identified potential genetic and non-genetic contributors to psychopathy, including influences on brain function. Proponents of the triarchic model believe that psychopathy results from the interaction of genetic predispositions and an adverse environment. What is adverse may differ depending on the underlying predisposition: for example, it is hypothesized that persons having high boldness may respond poorly to punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments. \\n\\nGenetically informed studies of the personality characteristics typical of individuals with psychopathy have found moderate genetic (as well as non-genetic) influences. On the PPI, fearless dominance and impulsive antisociality were similarly influenced by genetic factors and uncorrelated with each other. Genetic factors may generally influence the development of psychopathy while environmental factors affect the specific expression of the traits that predominate. A study on a large group of children found more than 60% heritability for \\\" callous-unemotional traits \\\" and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children without these traits. \\n\\nA study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the PCL:SV at age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, being physically neglected, low involvement of the father with the boy, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing. There has also been association between psychopathy and detrimental treatment by peers. However, it is difficult to determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of evidence of its strong heritability. \\n\\nResearchers have linked head injuries with psychopathy and violence. Since the 1980s, scientists have associated traumatic brain injury, such as damage to the prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex, with psychopathic behavior and a deficient ability to make morally and socially acceptable decisions, a condition that has been termed \\\" acquired sociopathy \\\" , or \\\" pseudopsychopathy \\\" . Individuals with damage to the area of the prefrontal cortex known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex show remarkable similarities to diagnosed psychopathic individuals, displaying reduced autonomic response to emotional stimuli, deficits in aversive conditioning, similar preferences in moral and economic decision making, and diminished empathy and social emotions like guilt or shame. These emotional and moral impairments may be especially severe when the brain injury occurs at a young age. Children with early damage in the prefrontal cortex may never fully develop social or moral reasoning and become \\\" psychopathic individuals ... characterized by high levels of aggression and antisocial behavior performed without guilt or empathy for their victims \\\" . Additionally, damage to the amygdala may impair the ability of the prefrontal cortex to interpret feedback from the limbic system, which could result in uninhibited signals that manifest in violent and aggressive behavior. \\n\\nPsychopathy is associated with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of disability and death due to factors such as violence, accidents, homicides, and suicides. This, in combination with the evidence for genetic influences, is evolutionarily puzzling and may suggest that there are compensating evolutionary advantages, and researchers within evolutionary psychology have proposed several evolutionary explanations. According to one hypothesis, some traits associated with psychopathy may be socially adaptive, and psychopathy may be a frequency-dependent, socially parasitic strategy, which may work as long as there is a large population of altruistic and trusting individuals, relative to the population of psychopathic individuals, to be exploited. It is also suggested that some traits associated with psychopathy such as early, promiscuous, adulterous, and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive success. Robert Hare has stated that many psychopathic males have a pattern of mating with and quickly abandoning women, and thereby have a high fertility rate, resulting in children that may inherit a predisposition to psychopathy. \\n\\nCriticism includes that it may be better to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability. Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of a very large number of adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small effect that it escapes natural selection. The personality is thought to be influenced by a very large number of genes and may be disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be a product of a high mutation load. Psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or side-effect, of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself. \\n\\nSome laboratory research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, as well as low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While it has been argued that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy. \\n\\nThanks to advancing MRI studies, experts are able to visualize specific brain differences and abnormalities of individuals with psychopathy in areas that control emotions, social interactions, ethics, morality, regret, impulsivity and conscience within the brain. Blair, a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic tendencies stated, \\u201cWith regard to psychopathy, we have clear indications regarding why the pathology gives rise to the emotional and behavioral disturbance and important insights into the neural systems implicated in this pathology\\u201d. Dadds et al., remarks that despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy. \\n\\nA 2008 review by Weber et al. suggested that psychopathy is sometimes associated with brain abnormalities in prefrontal-temporo-limbic regions that are involved in emotional and learning processes, among others. Neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences between those scoring high and low on the PCL-R in a 2011 review by Skeem et al. stating that they are \\\" most notably in the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, striatum, insula, and frontal and temporal cortex \\\" . A 2010 meta-analysis found that antisocial, violent and psychopathic individuals had reduced structure function in the right orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. \\n\\nThe amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (such as the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors. Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have been associated with \\\" callous-unemotional \\\" traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be due to methodological issues. \\n\\nSome of these findings are consistent with other research and theories. For example, in a neuroimaging study of how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words, widespread differences in activation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared to \\\" normal \\\" volunteers, which is consistent with views in clinical psychology. Additionally, the notion of psychopathy being characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala, since deficits in aversive conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala dysfunction, potentially compounded by orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction, although the specific reasons are unknown. \\n\\nProponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy distinction and triarchic model argue that there are neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their views. For instance, the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued to be associated with reduced activity in the amygdala during fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced startle response, while the disinhibition factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable. \\n\\nHigh levels of testosterone combined with low levels of cortisol and/or serotonin have been theorized as contributing factors. Testosterone is \\\" associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction \\\" , and injecting testosterone \\\" shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity \\\" , decreases fearfulness, and increases \\\" responding to angry faces \\\" . Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with \\\" impulsive and highly negative reactions \\\" , and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated. Several animal studies note the role of serotonergic functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior. \\n\\nHowever, some studies on animal and human subjects have suggested that the emotional-interpersonal traits and predatory aggression of psychopathy, in contrast to impulsive and reactive aggression, is related to increased serotoninergic functioning. A study by Dolan and Anderson on the relationship between setotonin and psychopathic traits in a sample of personality disordered offenders, found that serotonin functioning as measured by prolactin response, while inversely associated with impulsive and antisocial traits, were positively correlated with arrogant and deceitful traits, and, to a lesser extent, callous and remorseless traits. Bari\\u015f Yildirim theorizes that the 5-HTTLPR \\\" long \\\" allele, which is generally regarded as protective against internalizing disorders, may interact with other serotoninergic genes to create a hyper-regulation and dampening of affective processes that results in psychopathy's emotional impairments. Furthermore, the combination of the 5-HTTLPR long allele and high testosterone levels has been found to result in a reduced response to threat as measured by cortisol reactivity, which mirrors the fear deficits found in those afflicted with psychopathy. \\n\\nStudies have suggested other correlations. Psychopathy was associated in two studies with an increased ratio of HVA (a dopamine metabolite) to 5-HIAA (a serotonin metabolite). Studies have found that individuals with the traits meeting criteria for psychopathy show a greater dopamine response to potential \\\" rewards \\\" such as monetary promises or taking drugs such as amphetamines. This has been theoretically linked to increased impulsivity. A 2010 British study found that a large 2D:4D digit ratio, an indication of high prenatal estrogen exposure, was a \\\" positive correlate of psychopathy in females, and a positive correlate of callous affect (psychopathy sub-scale) in males \\\" . \\n\\nFindings have also shown monoamine oxidase A to affect the predictive ability of the PCL-R. Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and are, therefore, capable of influencing feelings, mood, and behavior in individuals. Findings suggest that further research is needed in this area. \\n\\nPsychopathy is most commonly assessed with the Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R), created by Robert D. Hare based on Cleckley's criteria from the 1940s, criminological concepts such as those of William and Joan McCord, and his own research on criminals and incarcerated offenders in Canada. The PCL-R is widely used and is referred to by some as the \\\" gold standard \\\" for assessing psychopathy. There are nonetheless numerous criticisms of the PCL-R as a theoretical tool and in real-world usage. \\n\\nUnlike the PCL, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) was developed to comprehensively index personality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves. It is a self-report scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales. The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two. Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality. \\n\\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying mental disorders\\u2014the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. \\n\\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \\\" antisocial reaction \\\" and \\\" dyssocial reaction \\\" . The latter two eventually became antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in the DSM and dissocial personality disorder in the ICD. Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such. \\n\\nThere are some traditional personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Psychopathic Deviate scale), California Psychological Inventory (Socialization scale), and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There is also the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), but in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults. \\n\\nAs with other mental disorders, psychopathy as a personality disorder may be present with a variety of other diagnosable conditions. Studies especially suggest strong comorbidity with antisocial personality disorder. Among numerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders, panic and obsessive\\u2013compulsive disorders, but not neurotic disorders in general, schizophrenia, or depression. \\n\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be highly comorbid with conduct disorder (a theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies. This may be explained in part by deficits in executive function. Anxiety disorders often co-occur with ASPD, and contrary to assumptions, psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety; this appears to be related to items from Factor 2 but not Factor 1 of the PCL-R. Psychopathy is also associated with substance use disorders. \\n\\nIt has been suggested that psychopathy may be comorbid with several other conditions than these, but limited work on comorbidity has been carried out. This may be partly due to difficulties in using inpatient groups from certain institutions to assess comorbidity, owing to the likelihood of some bias in sample selection. \\n\\nResearch on psychopathy has largely been done on men and the PCL-R was developed using mainly male criminal samples, raising the question of how well the results apply to women. Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar factor structure for men and women. \\n\\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with openness to experience in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while in women it manifests more as a histrionic pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women. \\n\\nStudies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men, with one study reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to 31 percent of violent males. Other studies have also pointed out that high psychopathic females are rare in forensic settings. \\n\\nPsychopathy has often been considered untreatable. Its unique characteristics makes it among the most refractory of personality disorders, a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered difficult to treat. People afflicted with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their condition, and can be uncooperative in therapy. Attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as yet, no pharmacological therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime. Some studies suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the behavior of psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat. These failures have led to a widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects, a view that is exacerbated by the little research being done into this disorder compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses, which makes it more difficult to gain the understanding of this condition that is necessary to develop effective therapies. \\n\\nAlthough the core character deficits of highly psychopathic individuals are likely to be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings. \\n\\nPsychiatric medications may also alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes associated with the disorder or with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medications, although none have yet been approved by the FDA for this purpose. For example, a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high-security hospital inpatients with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits. However, research into the pharmacological treatment of psychopathy and the related condition antisocial personality disorder is minimal, with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental disorders. \\n\\nThe PCL-R, the PCL:SV, and the PCL:YV are highly regarded and widely used in criminal justice settings, particularly in North America. They may be used for risk assessment and for assessing treatment potential and be used as part of the decisions regarding bail, sentence, which prison to use, parole, and regarding whether a youth should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. There have been several criticisms against its use in legal settings. They include the general criticisms against the PCL-R, the availability of other risk assessment tools which may have advantages, and the excessive pessimism surrounding the prognosis and treatment possibilities of those who are diagnosed with psychopathy. \\n\\nThe interrater reliability of the PCL-R can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in applied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the PCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study it was estimated that of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to which side the rater testified for, and 30% was due to other rater differences. \\n\\nTo aid a criminal investigation, certain interrogation approaches may be used to exploit and leverage the personality traits of suspects thought to have psychopathy and make them more likely to divulge information. \\n\\nThe PCL-R score cut-off for a label of psychopathy is 25 out of 40 in the United Kingdom, instead of 30 as it is in the United States. \\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, \\\" psychopathic disorder \\\" was legally defined in the Mental Health Act (UK), under MHA1983, as \\\" a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including significant impairment of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned \\\" . This term was intended to reflect the presence of a personality disorder in terms of conditions for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. Amendments to MHA1983 within the Mental Health Act 2007 abolished the term \\\" psychopathic disorder \\\" , with all conditions for detention (e.g. mental illness, personality disorder, etc.) encompassed by the generic term of \\\" mental disorder \\\" . \\n\\nIn England and Wales, the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder is grounds for detention in secure psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act if they have committed serious crimes, but since such individuals are disruptive to other patients and not responsive to usual treatment methods this alternative to traditional incarceration is often not used. \\n\\nStarting in the 1930s, before some modern concepts of psychopathy were developed, \\\" sexual psychopath \\\" laws, the term referring broadly to mental illness, were introduced by some states, and by the mid-1960s more than half of the states had such laws. Sexual offenses were considered to be caused by underlying mental illnesses, and it was thought that sex offenders should be treated, in agreement with the general rehabilitative trends at this time. Courts committed sex offenders to a mental health facility for community protection and treatment. \\n\\nStarting in 1970, many of these laws were modified or abolished in favor of more traditional responses such as imprisonment due to criticism of the \\\" sexual psychopath \\\" concept as lacking scientific evidence, the treatment being ineffective, and predictions of future offending being dubious. There were also a series of cases where persons treated and released committed new sexual offenses. Starting in the 1990s, several states have passed sexually dangerous person laws, including registration, housing restrictions, public notification, mandatory reporting by health care professionals, and civil commitment, which permits indefinite confinement after a sentence has been completed. Psychopathy measurements may be used in the confinement decision process. \\n\\nThe prognosis for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, with some studies reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates, though it is noted that one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today. However, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has yet examined whether the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments. \\n\\nA 2008 study using the PCL:SV found that 1.2% of a US sample scored 13 or more out of 24, indicating \\\" potential psychopathy \\\" . The scores correlated significantly with violence, alcohol use, and lower intelligence. A 2009 British study by Coid et al., also using the PCL:SV, reported a community prevalence of 0.6% scoring 13 or more. However, if the scoring was adjusted to the recommended 18 or more, this would have left the prevalence closer to 0.1%. The scores correlated with younger age, male gender, suicide attempts, violence, imprisonment, homelessness, drug dependence, personality disorders (histrionic, borderline and antisocial), and panic and obsessive\\u2013compulsive disorders. \\n\\nPsychopathy has a much higher prevalence in the convicted and incarcerated population, where it is thought that an estimated 15\\u201325% of prisoners qualify for the diagnosis. A study on a sample of inmates in the UK found that 7.7% of the inmates interviewed met the PCL-R cut-off of 30 for a diagnosis of psychopathy. A study on a sample of inmates in Iran using the PCL:SV found a prevalence of 23% scoring 18 or more. A study by Nathan Brooks from Bond University found that around one in five corporate bosses display clinically significant psychopathic traits - a proportion similar to that among prisoners. \\n\\nThere is limited research on psychopathy in the general work populace, in part because the PCL-R includes antisocial behavior as a significant core factor (obtaining a PCL-R score above the threshold is unlikely without having significant scores on the antisocial-lifestyle factor) and does not include positive adjustment characteristics, and most researchers have studied psychopathy in incarcerated criminals, a relatively accessible population of research subjects. \\n\\nHowever, psychologists Fritzon and Board, in their study comparing the incidence of personality disorders in business executives against criminals detained in a mental hospital, found that the profiles of some senior business managers contained significant elements of personality disorders, including those referred to as the \\\" emotional components \\\" , or interpersonal-affective traits, of psychopathy. Factors such as boldness, disinhibition, and meanness as defined in the triarchic model, in combination with other advantages such as a favorable upbringing and high intelligence, are thought to correlate with stress immunity and stability, and may contribute to this particular expression. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as \\\" successful psychopaths \\\" or \\\" corporate psychopaths \\\" and they may not always have extensive histories of traditional criminal or antisocial behavior characteristic of the traditional conceptualization of psychopathy. Robert Hare claims that the prevalence of psychopathic traits is higher in the business world than in the general population, reporting that while about 1% of the general population meet the clinical criteria for psychopathy, figures of around 3\\u20134% have been cited for more senior positions in business. Hare considers newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a \\\" corporate psychopath \\\" . \\n\\nAcademics on this subject believe that although psychopathy is manifested in only a small percentage of workplace staff, it is more common at higher levels of corporate organizations, and its negative effects (for example, increased bullying, conflict, stress, staff turnover, absenteeism, reduction in productivity) often causes a ripple effect throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire corporate culture. Employees with the disorder are self-serving opportunists, and may disadvantage their own organizations to further their own interests. They may be charming to staff above their level in the workplace hierarchy, aiding their ascent through the organization, but abusive to staff below their level, and can do enormous damage when they are positioned in senior management roles. Psychopathy as measured by the PCL-R is associated with lower performance appraisals among corporate professionals. The psychologist Oliver James identifies psychopathy as one of the dark triadic traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and Machiavellianism, which, like psychopathy, can have negative consequences. \\n\\nAccording to a study from the University of Notre Dame published in the Journal of Business Ethics, psychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision, and are more likely to thrive under abusive bosses, being more resistant to stress, including interpersonal abuse, and having less of a need for positive relationships than others. \\n\\nCharacters with psychopathy or sociopathy are some of the most notorious characters in film and literature, but their characterizations may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy as it is defined in psychiatry, criminology, and research. The character may be identified as having psychopathy within the fictional work itself, by its creators, or from the opinions of audiences and critics, and may be based on undefined popular stereotypes of psychopathy. Characters with psychopathic traits have appeared in Greek and Roman mythology, Bible stories, and some of Shakespeare's works. \\n\\nSuch characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or antihero, where the general characteristics and stereotypes associated with psychopathy are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions, criteria, and popular conceptions throughout its history have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many of the characters characterized as psychopathic in notable works at the time of publication may no longer fit the current definition and conception of psychopathy. There are several archetypal images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming con artist, the deranged serial killer and mass murderer, the callous and scheming businessperson, and the chronic low-level offender and juvenile delinquent. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of a mythical bogeyman, the disgust and intrigue surrounding evil, and fascination and sometimes perhaps envy of people who might appear to go through life without attachments and unencumbered by guilt, anguish or insecurity. \\n\\nThe word psychopathy is a joining of the Greek words psyche (\\u03c8\\u03c5\\u03c7\\u03ae) \\\" soul \\\" and pathos (\\u03c0\\u03ac\\u03b8\\u03bf\\u03c2) \\\" suffering, feeling \\\" . The first documented use is from 1847 in Germany as psychopatisch, and the noun psychopath has been traced to 1885. In medicine, patho- has a more specific meaning of disease (thus pathology has meant the study of disease since 1610, and psychopathology has meant the study of mental disorder in general since 1847. A sense of \\\" a subject of pathology, morbid, excessive \\\" is attested from 1845, including the phrase pathological liar from 1891 in the medical literature). \\n\\nThe term psychopathy initially had a very general meaning referring to all sorts of mental disorders and social aberrations, popularised from 1891 in Germany by Koch's concept of \\\" psychopathic inferiority \\\" (psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten). Some medical dictionaries still define psychopathy in both a narrow and broad sense, such as MedlinePlus from the U.S. National Library of Medicine. On the other hand, Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines psychopathy only as an outdated term for an antisocial type of personality disorder. \\n\\nThe term psychosis was also used in Germany from 1841, originally in a very general sense. The suffix -\\u03c9\\u03c3\\u03b9\\u03c2 (-osis) meant in this case \\\" abnormal condition \\\" . This term or its adjective psychotic would come to refer to the more severe mental disturbances and then specifically to mental states or disorders characterized by hallucinations, delusions or in some other sense markedly out of touch with reality. \\n\\nThe slang term psycho has been traced to a shortening of the adjective psychopathic from 1936, and from 1942 as a shortening of the noun psychopath, but it is also used as shorthand for psychotic or crazed. \\n\\nThe media usually uses the term psychopath to designate any criminal whose offenses are particularly abhorrent and unnatural, but that is not its original or general psychiatric meaning. \\n\\nThe word element socio- has been commonly used in compound words since around 1880. The term sociopathy may have been first introduced in 1909 in Germany by biological psychiatrist Karl Birnbaum and in 1930 in the US by educational psychologist George E. Partridge, as an alternative to the concept of psychopathy. It was used to indicate that the defining feature is violation of social norms, or antisocial behavior, and may be social or biological in origin. \\n\\nThe term is used in various different ways in contemporary usage. Robert Hare stated in the popular science book Snakes in Suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user's views on the origins and determinants of the disorder. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors. Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing from the average person in the sense of right and wrong. \\n\\nAncient writings that have been connected to psychopathic traits include Deuteronomy 21:18\\u201321, which was written around 700 BCE, and a description of an unscrupulous man by the Greek philosopher Theophrastus around 300 BCE. \\n\\nThe concept of psychopathy has been indirectly connected to the early 19th century with the work of Pinel (1801; \\\" mania without delirium \\\" ) and Pritchard (1835; \\\" moral insanity \\\" ), although historians have largely discredited the idea of a direct equivalence. Psychopathy originally described any illness of the mind, but found its application to a narrow subset of mental conditions when was used toward the end of the 19th century by the German psychiatrist Julius Koch (1891) to describe various behavioral and moral dysfunction in the absence of an obvious mental illness or intellectual disability. He applied the term psychopathic inferiority (psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten) to various chronic conditions and character disorders, and his work would influence the later conception of the personality disorder. \\n\\nThe term psychopathic came to be used to describe a diverse range of dysfunctional or antisocial behavior and mental and sexual deviances, including at the time homosexuality. It was often used to imply an underlying \\\" constitutional \\\" or genetic origin. Disparate early descriptions likely set the stage for modern controversies about the definition of psychopathy. \\n\\nAn influential figure in shaping modern American conceptualizations of psychopathy was American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley. In his classic monograph, The Mask of Sanity (1941), Cleckley drew on a small series of vivid case studies of psychiatric patients at a Veterans Administration hospital in Georgia to describe the disorder. Cleckley used the metaphor of the \\\" mask \\\" to refer to the tendency of psychopaths to appear confident, personable, and well-adjusted compared to most psychiatric patients, while revealing underlying pathology through their actions over time. Cleckley formulated sixteen criteria to describe the disorder. The Scottish psychiatrist David Henderson had also been influential in Europe from 1939 in narrowing the diagnosis. \\n\\nThe diagnostic category of sociopathic personality in early editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) had some key similarities to Cleckley's ideas, though in 1980 when renamed Antisocial Personality Disorder some of the underlying personality assumptions were removed. In 1980, Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare introduced an alternative measure, the \\\" Psychopathy Checklist \\\" (PCL) based largely on Cleckley's criteria, which was revised in 1991 (PCL-R), and is the most widely used measure of psychopathy. There are also several self-report tests, with the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) used more often among these in contemporary adult research. \\n\\nFamous individuals have sometimes been diagnosed, albeit at a distance, as psychopaths. As one example out of many possible from history, in a 1972 version of a secret report originally prepared for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943, and which may have been intended to be used as propaganda, non-medical psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer suggested Adolf Hitler was probably a psychopath. However, others have not drawn this conclusion; clinical forensic psychologist Glenn Walters argues that Hitler's actions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as, although he showed several characteristics of criminality, he was not always egocentric, callously disregarding of feelings or lacking impulse control, and there is no proof he could not learn from mistakes. \\n\\nAntisocial personality disorder \\n\\nCallous and unemotional traits \\n\\nDark triad \\n\\nMacdonald triad \\n\\nMoral psychology \\n\\nPathological lying \\n\\nMalignant narcissism \\n\\nSadistic personality disorder \\n\\nSerial rapist \\n\\nBlack, Will (2014) Psychopathic Cultures and Toxic Empires Frontline Noir, Edinburgh \\n\\nBlair, J. et al.

      "{\"title\": \"Trichomoniasis\", \"parsed_text\": \" \\n\\nTrichomoniasis (trich) is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin vaginal discharge, burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy. \\n\\nTrichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present. Diagnosis is by finding the parasite in the vaginal fluid using a microscope, culturing the vagina or urine, or testing for the parasite's DNA. If present other STIs should be tested for. \\n\\nMethods of prevention include not having sex, using condoms, not douching, and being tested for STIs before having sex with a new partner. Trichomoniasis can be cured with antibiotics, either metronidazole or tinidazole. Sexual partners should also be treated. About 20% of people get infected again within three months of treatment. \\n\\nThere were about 122 million new cases of trichomoniasis in 2015. In the United States, there are about 2 million women affected. It occurs more often in women than men. Trichomonas vaginalis was first identified in 1836 by Alfred Donn\\u00e9. It was first recognized as causing this disease in 1916. \\n\\nMost people infected with trichomonas vaginalis do not have any symptoms and can be undetected for years. Symptoms experienced include pain, burning or itching in the penis, urethra (urethritis), or vagina (vaginitis). Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination. For women there may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling ( \\\" fishy \\\" smell) vaginal discharge. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure. Sometimes trichomoniasis can be confused with chlamydia because the symptoms are similar. \\n\\nTrichomoniasis is linked to two serious complications. \\n\\nTrichomoniasis is associated with increased risk of transmission and infection of HIV. \\n\\nTrichomoniasis may cause a woman to deliver a low-birth-weight or premature infant. \\n\\nThe role of trichomonas infection in causing cervical cancer is unclear, although trichomonas infection may be associated with co-infection with high-risk strains of HPV. \\n\\nT. vaginalis infection in males has been found to cause asymptomatic urethritis and prostatitis. In the prostate, it may create chronic inflammation that may eventually lead to prostate cancer. \\n\\nThe human genital tract is the only reservoir for this species. Trichomonas is transmitted through sexual or genital contact. \\n\\nThe single-celled protozoan produces mechanical stress on host cells and then ingests cell fragments after cell death. \\n\\nA draft sequence of the Trichomonas genome was published on January 12, 2007 in the journal Science confirming that the genome has at least 26,000 genes, a similar number to the human genome. An additional ~35,000 unconfirmed genes, including thousands that are part of potentially transposable elements, brings the gene content to well over 60,000. \\n\\nThere are three main ways to test for Trichomoniasis. \\n\\nThe first is known as saline microscopy. This is the most commonly used method and requires an endocervical, vaginal, or penile swab specimen for examination under a microscope. The presence of one or multiple trichomonads constitutes a positive result. This method is cheap but has a low sensitivity (60-70%) often due to an inadequate sample, resulting in false negatives. \\n\\nThe second diagnostic method is culture, which has historically been the \\\" gold standard \\\" in infectious disease diagnosis. Trichomonas Vaginalis culture tests are relatively cheap; however, sensitivity is still somewhat low (70-89%). \\n\\nThe third method includes the nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) which are more sensitive. These tests are more costly than microscopy and culture, and are highly sensitive (80-90%). \\n\\nUse of male condoms or female condoms may help prevent the spread of trichomoniasis, although careful studies have never been done that focus on how to prevent this infection. Infection with Trichomoniasis through water is unlikely because Trichomonas vaginalis dies in water after 45\\u201360 minutes, in thermal water after 30 minutes to 3 hours and in diluted urine after 5\\u20136 hours. \\n\\nCurrently there are no routine standard screening requirements for the general U.S. population receiving family planning or STI testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends Trichomoniasis testing for females with vaginal discharge and can be considered for females at higher risk for infection or of HIV-positive serostatus. \\n\\nThe advent of new, highly specific and sensitive trichomoniasis tests present opportunities for new screening protocols for both men and women. Careful planning, discussion, and research are required to determine the cost-efficiency and most beneficial use of these new tests for the diagnosis and treatment of trichomoniasis in the U.S., which can lead to better prevention efforts. \\n\\nA number of strategies have been found to improve follow-up for STI testing including email and text messaging as reminders of appointments. \\n\\nEvidence from a randomized controlled trials for screening pregnant women who do not have symptoms for infection with trichomoniasis and treating women who test positive for the infection have not consistently shown a reduced risk of preterm birth. Further studies are needed to verify this result and determine the best method of screening. In the US, screening of pregnant women without any symptoms is only recommended in those with HIV as trichomonas infection is associated with increased risk of transmitting HIV to the fetus. \\n\\nTreatment for both pregnant and non-pregnant women is usually with metronidazole, by mouth once. Caution should be used in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Sexual partners, even if they have no symptoms, should also be treated. \\n\\nFor 95-97% of cases, infection is resolved after one dose of metronidazole. Studies suggest that 4-5% of trichomonas cases are resistant to metronidazole, which may account for some \\u201crepeat\\u201d cases. Without treatment, trichomoniasis can persist for months to years in women, and is thought to improve without treatment in men. Women living with HIV infection have better cure rates if treated for 7 days rather than with one dose. \\n\\nTopical treatments are less effective than oral antibiotics due to Skene's gland and other genitourinary structures acting as a reservoir. \\n\\nThere were about 58 million cases of trichomoniasis in 2013. It is more common in women (2.7%) than males (1.4%). It is the most common non-viral STI in the U.S., with an estimated 3.7 million prevalent cases and 1.1 million new cases per year. It is estimated that 3% of the general U.S. population is infected, and 7.5-32% of moderate-to-high risk (including incarcerated) populations. \\n\\nTrichomoniasis at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\n\\nVaginitis/Vaginal infection fact sheet from the National Institute of Allergies and Infections.

      "{\"title\": \"Hydrocephalus\", \"parsed_text\": \" \\n\\nHydrocephalus is a condition in which an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs within the brain. This typically causes increased pressure inside the skull. Older people may have headaches, double vision, poor balance, urinary incontinence, personality changes, or mental impairment. In babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes. \\n\\nHydrocephalus can occur due to birth defects or be acquired later in life. Associated birth defects include neural tube defects and those that result in aqueductal stenosis. Other causes include meningitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, intraventricular hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The four types of hydrocephalus are communicating, noncommunicating, ex vacuo, and normal pressure. Diagnosis is typically made by physical examination and medical imaging. \\n\\nHydrocephalus is typically treated by the surgical placement of a shunt system. A procedure called a third ventriculostomy may be an option in a few people. Complications from shunts may include overdrainage, underdrainage, mechanical failure, infection, or obstruction. This may require replacement. Outcomes are variable, but many people with shunts live normal lives. Without treatment, death or permanent disability may occur. \\n\\nAbout one to two per 1,000 newborns have hydrocephalus. Rates in the developing world may be higher. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is estimated to affect about 5 per 100,000 people, with rates increasing with age. Description of hydrocephalus by Hippocrates date back more than 2,000 years. The word \\\" hydrocephalus \\\" is from the Greek , meaning \\\" water \\\" and , meaning \\\" head \\\" . \\n\\nThe clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity. Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). By contrast, chronic dilatation (especially in the elderly population) may have a more insidious onset presenting, for instance, with Hakim's triad (Adams' triad). \\n\\nSymptoms of increased ICP may include headaches, vomiting, nausea, papilledema, sleepiness, or coma. Elevated ICP may result in uncal or tonsillar herniation, with resulting life-threatening brain stem compression. \\n\\nHakim's triad of gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy (Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate, where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person's age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling. \\n\\nIn infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in the central nervous system (CNS), causing the fontanelle (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include: \\n\\nEyes that appear to gaze downward \\n\\nIrritability \\n\\nSeizures \\n\\nSeparated sutures \\n\\nSleepiness \\n\\nVomiting \\n\\nSymptoms that may occur in older children can include: \\n\\nBrief, shrill, high-pitched cry \\n\\nChanges in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think \\n\\nChanges in facial appearance and eye spacing (craniofacial disproportion) \\n\\nCrossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements \\n\\nDifficulty feeding \\n\\nExcessive sleepiness \\n\\nHeadaches \\n\\nIrritability, poor temper control \\n\\nLoss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) \\n\\nLoss of coordination and trouble walking \\n\\nMuscle spasticity (spasm) \\n\\nSlow growth (child 0\\u20135 years) \\n\\nDelayed milestones \\n\\nFailure-to-thrive \\n\\nSlow or restricted movement \\n\\nVomiting \\n\\nBecause hydrocephalus can injure the brain, thought and behavior may be adversely affected. Learning disabilities, including short-term memory loss, are common among those with hydrocephalus, who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain. However, the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals, and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Someone with hydrocephalus may have coordination and visual problems, or clumsiness. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (this is called precocious puberty). About one in four develops epilepsy. \\n\\nCongenital hydrocephalus is present in the infant prior to birth, meaning the fetus developed hydrocephalus in utero during fetal development. The most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus is aqueductal stenosis, which occurs when the narrow passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the brain is blocked or too narrow to allow sufficient cerebral spinal fluid to drain. Fluid accumulates in the upper ventricles, causing hydrocephalus. \\n\\nOther causes of congenital hydrocephalus include neural-tube defects, arachnoid cysts, Dandy\\u2013Walker syndrome, and Arnold\\u2013Chiari malformation. \\n\\nThe cranial bones fuse by the end of the third year of life. For head enlargement to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then. The causes are usually genetic, but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life, which include intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in premature infants, infections, type II Arnold-Chiari malformation, aqueduct atresia and stenosis, and Dandy-Walker malformation. \\n\\nIn newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile. Since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined together, bulging, firm anterior and posterior fontanelles may be present even when the person is in an upright position. \\n\\nThe infant exhibits fretfulness, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor sets in, and infants show lack of interest in their surroundings. Later on, their upper eyelids become retracted and their eyes are turned downwards ( \\\" sunset eyes \\\" ) (due to hydrocephalic pressure on the mesencephalic tegmentum and paralysis of upward gaze). Movements become weak and the arms may become tremulous. Papilledema is absent, but vision may be reduced. The head becomes so enlarged that they eventually may be bedridden. \\n\\nAbout 80\\u201390% of fetuses or newborn infants with spina bifida\\u2014often associated with meningocele or myelomeningocele\\u2014develop hydrocephalus. \\n\\nThis condition is acquired as a consequence of CNS infections, meningitis, brain tumors, head trauma, toxoplasmosis, or intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal), and is usually painful. \\n\\nThe cause of hydrocephalus is not known with certainty and is probably multifactorial. It may be caused by impaired CSF flow, reabsorption, or excessive CSF production. \\n\\nObstruction to CSF flow hinders its free passage through the ventricular system and subarachnoid space (e.g., stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct or obstruction of the interventricular foramina secondary to tumors, hemorrhages, infections or congenital malformations) and can cause increases in ICP. \\n\\nHydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of CSF (relative obstruction) (e.g., choroid plexus papilloma, villous hypertrophy). \\n\\nBilateral ureteric obstruction is a rare, but reported, cause of hydrocephalus. \\n\\nBased on its underlying mechanisms, hydrocephalus can be classified into communicating and noncommunicating (obstructive). Both forms can be either congenital or acquired. \\n\\nCommunicating hydrocephalus, also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired CSF reabsorption in the absence of any obstruction of CSF flow between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. This may be due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal granulations (also called arachnoid granulations or Pacchioni's granulations), which are located along the superior sagittal sinus, and is the site of CSF reabsorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis, and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation. \\n\\nNoncommunicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by a CSF-flow obstruction. \\n\\nForamen of Monro obstruction may lead to dilation of one, or if large enough (e.g., in colloid cyst), both lateral ventricles. \\n\\nThe aqueduct of Sylvius, normally narrow, may be obstructed by a number of genetic or acquired lesions (e.g., atresia, ependymitis, hemorrhage, or tumor) and lead to dilation of both lateral ventricles, as well as the third ventricle. \\n\\nFourth ventricle obstruction leads to dilatation of the aqueduct, as well as the lateral and third ventricles (e.g., Chiari malformation). \\n\\nThe foramina of Luschka and foramen of Magendie may be obstructed due to congenital malformation (e.g., Dandy-Walker malformation). \\n\\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a particular form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus, characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles, with only intermittently elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Characteristic triad of symptoms are; dementia, apraxic gait and urinary incontinence. The diagnosis of NPH can be established only with the help of continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer), since more often than not instant measurements yield normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful. Altered compliance (elasticity) of the ventricular walls, as well as increased viscosity of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis. \\n\\nHydrocephalus ex vacuo also refers to an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and is usually due to brain atrophy (as it occurs in dementias), post-traumatic brain injuries, and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a compensatory enlargement of the CSF-spaces in response to brain parenchyma loss; it is not the result of increased CSF pressure. \\n\\nHydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of CSF outflow in the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space over the brain. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the spinal cord and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a congenital malformation blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of head injuries or infections. \\n\\nCompression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as convulsions, intellectual disability, and epileptic seizures. These signs occur sooner in adults, whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within. Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones\\u2014which have yet to fuse\\u2014to bulge outward at their juncture points. Another medical sign, in infants, is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris, as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids. \\n\\nThe elevated ICP may cause compression of the brain, leading to brain damage and other complications. Conditions among affected individuals vary widely. \\n\\nIf the foramina of the fourth ventricle or the cerebral aqueduct are blocked, CSF can accumulate within the ventricles. This condition is called internal hydrocephalus and it results in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain, causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the nervous tissue. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in irreversible brain damage. If the skull bones are not completely ossified when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of birth or may become blocked later in life because of a tumor growing in the brainstem. \\n\\nHydrocephalus treatment is surgical, creating a way for the excess fluid to drain away. In the short term, an external ventricular drain (EVD), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief. In the long term, some people will need any of various types of cerebral shunt. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic) into the cerebral ventricles to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt), but alternative sites include the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt), pleural cavity (ventriculopleural shunt), and gallbladder. A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the CSF redirected to the peritoneal cavity (lumbar-peritoneal shunt). An alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected people is the endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the CSF to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction, as in aqueductal stenosis. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy. For infants, ETV is sometimes combined with choroid plexus cauterization, which reduces the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced by the brain. The technique, known as ETV/CPC, was pioneered in Uganda by neurosurgeon Benjamin Warf and is now in use in several U.S. hospitals. \\n\\nHydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube (shunt) between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity. Some risk exists of infection being introduced into the brain through these shunts, however, and the shunts must be replaced as the person grows. \\n\\nExternal hydrocephalus is a condition generally seen in infants which involves enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces around the outside of the brain. This is generally a benign condition that resolves spontaneously by two years of age and therefore usually does not require insertion of a shunt. Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting, headaches, and seizures. \\n\\nExamples of possible complications include shunt malfunction, shunt failure, and shunt infection, along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery (the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract). Although a shunt generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged) or infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens, the CSF begins to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, such as seizures. The shunt failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a person's first surgery) and people not uncommonly have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetimes. \\n\\nAnother complication can occur when CSF drains more rapidly than it is produced by the choroid plexus, causing symptoms of listlessness, severe headaches, irritability, light sensitivity, auditory hyperesthesia (sound sensitivity), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, migraines, seizures, a change in personality, weakness in the arms or legs, strabismus, and double vision to appear when the person is vertical. If the person lies down, the symptoms usually vanish quickly. A CT scan may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the person has a history of slit-like ventricles. Difficulty in diagnosing over-drainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for people and their families. Resistance to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure. \\n\\nThe diagnosis of CSF buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise. Diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear, that is, whether symptoms occur when the person is upright or in a prone position, with the head at roughly the same level as the feet. \\n\\nStandardized protocols for inserting cerebral shunts have been shown to reduce shunt infections. \\n\\nReferences to hydrocephalic skulls can be found in ancient Egyptian medical literature from 2,500 BC to 500 AD. Hydrocephalus was described more clearly by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates in the fourth century BC, while a more accurate description was later given by the Roman physician Galen in the second century AD. \\n\\nThe first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus appears in the Al-Tasrif (1,000 AD) by the Arab surgeon Abulcasis, who clearly described the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children. He described it in his chapter on neurosurgical disease, describing infantile hydrocephalus as being caused by mechanical compression. He wrote: \\n\\nIn 1881, a few years after the landmark study of Retzius and Key, Carl Wernicke pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external drainage of CSF for the treatment of hydrocephalus. It remained an intractable condition until the 20th century, when cerebral shunt and other neurosurgical treatment modalities were developed. \\n\\nIt is a lesser-known medical condition; relatively little research is conducted to improve treatment, and still no cure has been found. In developing countries, the condition often goes untreated at birth. Before birth, the condition is difficult to diagnose, and access to medical treatment is limited. However, when head swelling is prominent, children are taken at great expense for treatment. By then, brain tissue is undeveloped and neurosurgery is rare and difficult. Children more commonly live with undeveloped brain tissue and consequential intellectual disabilities and restrictions. \\n\\nThe word \\\" hydrocephalus \\\" is from the Greek meaning \\\" water \\\" and meaning \\\" head \\\" . Other names for hydrocephalus include \\\" water on the brain \\\" , a historical name, and \\\" water baby syndrome \\\" . \\n\\nSeptember was designated National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month in July 2009 by the U.S. Congress in . The resolution campaign is due in part to the advocacy work of the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation. Prior to July 2009, no awareness month for this condition had been designated. Many of the hydrocephalus organizations within the U.S. use various ribbon designs as a part of their awareness and fundraising activities. \\n\\nOne exceptional case of hydrocephalus was a man whose brain shrank to a thin sheet of tissue, due to a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in his skull. As a child, the man had a shunt, but it was removed when he was 14. In July 2007, at age 44, he went to a hospital due to mild weakness in his left leg. When doctors learned of the man's medical history, they performed a CT and MRI scan, and were astonished to see \\\" massive enlargement \\\" of the lateral ventricles in the skull. Dr. Lionel Feuillet of H\\u00f4pital de la Timone in Marseille said, \\\" The images were most unusual... the brain was virtually absent. \\\" Intelligence tests showed the person had an IQ of 75, considered \\\" borderline intellectual functioning \\\" , just above what would be officially considered mentally challenged. \\n\\nThe person was a married father of two children, and worked as a civil servant, leading an at least superficially normal life, despite having enlarged ventricles with a decreased volume of brain tissue. \\\" What I find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life \\\" , commented Dr. Max Muenke, a pediatric brain-defect specialist at the National Human Genome Research Institute. \\\" If something happens very slowly over quite some time, maybe over decades, the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side. \\\" \\n\\nAuthor Sherman Alexie, born with the condition, wrote about it in his semi-autobiographical junior fiction novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. \\n\\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester (1689\\u20131700) probably contracted meningitis at birth, which resulted in this condition. \\n\\nEmperor Ferdinand I of Austria (1793\\u20131875) became emperor in 1835 despite various health issues including hydrocephalus and epilepsy. \\n\\nGuidelines for pediatric hydrocephalus\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-22T10:20:28Z\", \"text_length\": 23574}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Temporomandibular joint dysfunction\", \"parsed_text\": \" \\n\\nTemporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, TMJD) is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) and the temporomandibular joints (the joints which connect the mandible to the skull). The most important feature is pain, followed by restricted mandibular movement, and noises from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) during jaw movement. Although TMD is not life-threatening, it can be detrimental to quality of life, because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage. \\n\\nIn this article, the term temporomandibular disorder is taken to mean any disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (here also abbreviated to TMD) is taken to mean symptomatic (e.g. pain, limitation of movement, clicking) dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint. However, there is no single, globally accepted term or definition concerning this topic. \\n\\nTMD is a symptom complex rather than a single condition, and it is thought to be caused by multiple factors. However, these factors are poorly understood, and there is disagreement as to their relative importance. There are many treatments available, although there is a general lack of evidence for any treatment in TMD, and no widely accepted treatment protocol. Common treatments include provision of occlusal splints, psychosocial interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and pain medication or others. Most sources agree that no irreversible treatment should be carried out for TMD. \\n\\nAbout 20% to 30% of the adult population are affected to some degree. Usually people affected by TMD are between 20 and 40 years of age, and it is more common in females than males. TMD is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain (i.e. toothache). \\n\\n+ Classification: \\n\\n:::: Muscular: \\n\\nHyperactivity, spasm, and trismus \\n\\nInflammation (myositis) \\n\\nTrauma \\n\\nMyofascial pain and fibromyalgia \\n\\nAtrophy or hypertrophy \\n\\n::: Arthrogenic: \\n\\nDisc displacement (internal derangement) \\n\\nHypomobility of the disc (adhesions or scars) \\n\\nDislocation and subluxation \\n\\nArthritis \\n\\nInfections \\n\\nMetabolic disease (gout, chondrocalcinosis) \\n\\nCapsulitis, synovitis \\n\\nAnkylosis (fibrous or bony) \\n\\nFracture \\n\\nAbsent, large, or small condyloid process \\n\\nNeoplasia \\n\\nTMD is considered by some to be one of the 4 major symptom complexes in chronic orofacial pain, along with burning mouth syndrome, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia. TMD has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or rheumatological disorder. It has also been called a functional pain syndrome, and a psychogenic disorder. Others consider TMD a \\\" central sensitivity syndrome \\\" , in reference to evidence that TMD might be caused by a centrally mediated sensitivity to pain. It is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between TMD and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, headache, chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain. These disorders have also been theorized to be caused by centrally mediated sensitivity to pain, and furthermore they often occur together. \\n\\nFrequently, TMD has been treated as a single syndrome, but the prevailing modern view is that TMD is a cluster of related disorders with many common features. Indeed, some have suggested that, in the future, the term TMD may be discarded as the different causes are fully identified and separated into different conditions. Sometimes, \\\" temporomandibular joint dysfunction \\\" is described as the most common form of temporomandibular disorder, whereas many other sources use the term temporomandibular disorder synonymously, or instead of the term temporomandibular joint dysfunction. In turn, the term temporomandibular disorder is defined as \\\" musculoskeletal disorders affecting the temporomandibular joints and their associated musculature. It is a collective term which represents a diverse group of pathologies involving the temporomandibular joint, the muscles of mastication, or both \\\" . Another definition of temporomandibular disorders is \\\" a group of conditions with similar signs and symptoms that affect the temporomandibular joints, the muscles of mastication, or both. \\\" Temporomandibular disorder is a term that creates confusion since it refers to a group of similarly symptomatic conditions, whilst many sources use the term temporomandibular disorders as a vague description, rather than a specific syndrome, and refer to any condition which may affect the temporomandibular joints (see table). The temporomandibular joint is susceptible to a huge range of diseases, some rarer than others, and there is no implication that all of these will cause any symptoms or limitation in function at all. \\n\\nThe preferred terms in medical publications is to an extent influenced by geographic location. For example, in the United Kingdom, the term pain dysfunction syndrome is in common use. In the United States, the term temporomandibular disorder is generally favored. The American Academy of Orofacial Pain uses temporomandibular disorder, whilst the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research uses temporomandibular joint disorder. A more complete list of synonyms for this topic is extensive, with some being more commonly used than others. In addition to those already mentioned, examples include temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome, temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome, temporomandibular joint syndrome, temporomandibular dysfunction syndrome, temporomandibular dysfunction, temporomandibular disorder, temporomandibular syndrome, facial arthromyalgia, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome, craniomandibular dysfunction (CMD), myofacial pain dysfunction, masticatory myalgia, mandibular dysfunction, and Costen's syndrome. \\n\\nThe lack of standardization in terms is not restricted to medical papers. Notable internationally recognized sources vary in both their preferred term, and their offered definition. For example: \\n\\nIt has been suggested that TMD may develop following physical trauma, particularly whiplash injury, although the evidence for this is not conclusive. This type of TMD is sometimes termed \\\" posttraumatic TMD \\\" (pTMD) to distinguish it from TMD of unknown cause, sometimes termed \\\" idiopathic TMD \\\" (iTMD). Sometimes muscle-related (myogenous) TMD (also termed myogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to myofascial pain and dysfunction) is distinguished from joint-related TMD (also termed arthogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to true articular disease), based upon whether the muscles of mastication or the TMJs themselves are predominantly involved. This classification, which effectively divides TMD into 2 syndromes, is followed by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain. However, since most people with TMD could be placed into both of these groups, which makes a single diagnosis difficult when this classification is used. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) allows for multiple diagnoses in an attempt to overcome the problems with other classifications. RDC/TMD considers temporomandibular disorders in 2 axes; axis I is the physical aspects, and axis II involves assessment of psychological status, mandibular function and TMD-related psychosocial disability. Axis I is further divided into 3 general groups. Group I are muscle disorders, group II are disc displacements and group III are joint disorders, although it is common for people with TMD to fit into more than one of these groups. \\n\\nSometimes distinction is made between acute TMD, where symptoms last for less than 3 months, and chronic TMD, where symptoms last for more than 3 months. Not much is known about acute TMD since these individuals do not typically attend in secondary care (hospital). \\n\\nSigns and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation. The symptoms will usually involve more than one of the various components of the masticatory system, muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, bones, connective tissue, or the teeth. TMJ dysfunction is commonly associated with symptoms affecting cervical spine dysfunction and altered head and cervical spine posture. \\n\\nThe three classically described, cardinal signs and symptoms of TMD are: \\n\\nPain and tenderness on palpation in the muscles of mastication, or of the joint itself (preauricular pain \\u2013 pain felt just in front of the ear). Pain is the defining feature of TMD and is usually aggravated by manipulation or function, such as when chewing, clenching, or yawning, and is often worse upon waking. The character of the pain is usually dull or aching, poorly localized, and intermittent, although it can sometimes be constant. The pain is more usually unilateral (located on one side) rather than bilateral. It is rarely severe. \\n\\nLimited range of mandibular movement, which may cause difficulty eating or even talking. There may be locking of the jaw, or stiffness in the jaw muscles and the joints, especially present upon waking. There may also be incoordination, asymmetry or deviation of mandibular movement. \\n\\nNoises from the joint during mandibular movement, which may be intermittent. Joint noises may be described as clicking, popping, or crepitus (grating). \\n\\nOther signs and symptoms have also been described, although these are less common and less significant than the cardinal signs and symptoms listed above. Examples include: \\n\\nHeadache (possibly), e.g. pain in the occipital region (the back of the head), or the forehead; or other types of facial pain including migraine, tension headache. or myofascial pain. \\n\\nPain elsewhere, such as the teeth or neck. \\n\\nDiminished auditory acuity (hearing loss). \\n\\nTinnitus (occasionally). \\n\\nDizziness. \\n\\nSensation of malocclusion (feeling that the teeth do not meet together properly). \\n\\nTMD is a symptom complex (i.e. a group of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a particular disease), which is thought to be caused by multiple, poorly understood factors, but the exact etiology is unknown. There are factors which appear to predispose to TMD (genetic, hormonal, anatomical), factors which may precipitate it (trauma, occlusal changes, parafunction), and also factors which may prolong it (stress and again parafunction). Overall, two hypotheses have dominated research into the causes of TMD, namely a psychosocial model and a theory of occlusal dysharmony. Interest in occlusal factors as a causative factor in TMD was especially widespread in the past, and the theory has since fallen out of favor and become controversial due to lack of evidence. \\n\\nIn people with TMD, it has been shown that the lower head of lateral pterygoid contracts during mouth closing (when it should relax), and is often tender to palpation. To theorize upon this observation, some have suggested that due to a tear in the back of the joint capsule, the articular disc may be displaced forwards (anterior disc displacement), stopping the upper head of lateral pterygoid from acting to stabilize the disc as it would do normally. As a biologic compensatory mechanism, the lower head tries to fill this role, hence the abnormal muscle activity during mouth closure. There is some evidence that anterior disc displacement is present in proportion of TMD cases. Anterior disc displacement with reduction refers to abnormal forward movement of the disc during opening which reduces upon closing. Anterior disc displacement without reduction refers to an abnormal forward, bunched-up position of the articular disc which does not reduce. In this latter scenario, the disc is not intermediary between the condyle and the articular fossa as it should be, and hence the articular surfaces of the bones themselves are exposed to a greater degree of wear (which may predispose to osteoarthritis in later life). \\n\\nThe general term \\\" degenerative joint disease \\\" refers to arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) and arthrosis. The term arthrosis may cause confusion since in the specialized TMD literature it means something slightly different from in the wider medical literature. In medicine generally, arthrosis can be a nonspecific term for a joint, any disease of a joint (or specifically degenerative joint disease), and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis. In the specialized literature that has evolved around TMD research, arthrosis is differentiated from arthritis by the presence of low and no inflammation respectively. Both are however equally degenerative. The TMJs are sometimes described as one of the most used joints in the body. Over time, either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint, wear and degeneration can occur, termed osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune joint disease, can also affect the TMJs. Degenerative joint diseases may lead to defects in the shape of the tissues of the joint, limitation of function (e.g. restricted mandibular movements), and joint pain. \\n\\nEmotional stress (anxiety, depression, anger) may increase pain by causing autonomic, visceral and skeletal activity and by reduced inhibition via the descending pathways of the limbic system. The interactions of these biological systems have been described as a vicious \\\" anxiety-pain-tension \\\" cycle which is thought to be frequently involved in TMD. Put simply, stress and anxiety cause grinding of teeth and sustained muscular contraction in the face. This produces pain which causes further anxiety which in turn causes prolonged muscular spasm at trigger points, vasoconstriction, ischemia and release of pain mediators. The pain discourages use of the masticatory system (a similar phenomenon in other chronic pain conditions is termed \\\" fear avoidance \\\" behavior), which leads to reduced muscle flexibility, tone, strength and endurance. This manifests as limited mouth opening and a sensation that the teeth are not fitting properly. \\n\\nPersons with TMD have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders than people without TMD. People with TMD have been shown to have higher levels of anxiety, depression, somatization and sleep deprivation, and these could be considered important risk factors for the development of TMD. In the 6 months before the onset, 50\\u201370% of people with TMD report experiencing stressful life events (e.g. involving work, money, health or relationship loss). It has been postulated that such events induce anxiety and cause increased jaw muscle activity. Muscular hyperactivity has also been shown in people with TMD whilst taking examinations or watching horror films. \\n\\nOthers argue that a link between muscular hyperactivity and TMD has not been convincingly demonstrated, and that emotional distress may be more of a consequence of pain rather than a cause. \\n\\nBruxism is an oral parafunctional activity where there is excessive clenching and grinding of the teeth. It can occur during sleep or whilst awake. The cause of bruxism itself is not completely understood, but psychosocial factors appear to be implicated in awake bruxism and dopaminergic dysfunction and other central nervous system mechanisms may be involved in sleep bruxism. If TMD pain and limitation of mandibular movement are greatest upon waking, and then slowly resolve throughout the day, this may indicate sleep bruxism. Conversely, awake bruxism tends to cause symptoms that slowly get worse throughout the day, and there may be no pain at all upon waking. \\n\\nThe relationship of bruxism with TMD is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD. Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism. Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism. A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when more strict diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower. Self-reported bruxism is probably a poor method of identifying bruxism. There are also very many people who grind their teeth and who do not develop TMD. Bruxism and other parafunctional activities may play a role in perpetuating symptoms in some cases. \\n\\nOther parafunctional habits such as pen chewing, lip and cheek biting (which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum or linea alba), are also suggested to contribute to the development of TMD. Other parafunctional activities might include jaw thrusting, excessive gum chewing, nail biting and eating very hard foods. \\n\\nTrauma, both micro and macrotrauma, is sometimes identified as a possible cause of TMD; however, the evidence for this is not strong. Prolonged mouth opening (hyper-extension) is also suggested as a possible cause. It is thought that this leads to microtrauma and subsequent muscular hyperactivity. This may occur during dental treatment, with oral intubation whilst under a general anesthetic, during singing or wind instrument practice (really these can be thought of as parafunctional activities). Damage may be incurred during violent yawning, laughing, road traffic accidents, sports injuries, interpersonal violence, or during dental treatment, (such as tooth extraction). \\n\\nIt has been proposed that a link exists between whiplash injuries (sudden neck hyper-extension usually occurring in road traffic accidents), and the development of TMD. This has been termed \\\" post-traumatic TMD \\\" , to separate it from \\\" idiopathic TMD \\\" . Despite multiple studies having been performed over the years, the cumulative evidence has been described as conflicting, with moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow whiplash injury. The research that suggests a link appears to demonstrate a low to moderate incidence of TMD following whiplash injury, and that pTMD has a poorer response to treatment than TMD which has not developed in relation to trauma. \\n\\nOcclusal factors as an etiologic factor in TMD is a controversial topic. Abnormalities of occlusion (problems with the bite) are often blamed for TMD but there is no evidence that these factors are involved. Occlusal abnormalities are incredibly common, and most people with occlusal abnormalities do not have TMD. Although occlusal features may affect observed electrical activity in masticatory muscles, there are no statistically significant differences in the number of occlusal abnormalities in people with TMD and in people without TMD. There is also no evidence for a causal link between orthodontic treatment and TMD. The modern, mainstream view is that the vast majority of people with TMD, occlusal factors are not related. Theories of occlusal factors in TMD are largely of historical interest. A causal relationship between occlusal factors and TMD was championed by Ramfjord in the 1960s. A small minority of dentists continue to prescribe occlusal adjustments in the belief that this will prevent or treat TMD despite the existence of systematic reviews of the subject which state that there is no evidence for such practices, and the vast majority of opinion being that no irreversible treatment should be carried out in TMD (see Occlusal adjustment). \\n\\nTMD does not obviously run in families like a genetic disease. It has been suggested that a genetic predisposition for developing TMD (and chronic pain syndromes generally) could exist. This has been postulated to be explained by variations of the gene which codes for the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) which may produce 3 different phenotypes with regards pain sensitivity. COMT (together with monoamine oxidase) is involved in breaking down catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). The variation of the COMT gene which produces less of this enzyme is associated with a high sensitivity to pain. Females with this variation, are at 2\\u20133 times greater risk of developing TMD than females without this variant. However this theory is controversial since there is conflicting evidence. \\n\\nSince females are more often affected by TMD than males, the female sex hormone estrogen has been suggested to be involved. The results of one study suggested that the periods of highest pain in TMD can be correlated with rapid periods of change in the circulating estrogen level. Low estrogen was also correlated to higher pain. In the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels fluctuate rapidly during ovulation, and also rapidly increases just before menstruation and rapidly decreases during menstruation. Post-menopausal females who are treated with hormone replacement therapy are more likely to develop TMD, or may experience an exacerbation if they already had TMD. Several possible mechanisms by which estrogen might be involved in TMD symptoms have been proposed. Estrogen may play a role in modulating joint inflammation, nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal nerve, muscle reflexes to pain and \\u03bc-opioid receptors. \\n\\nTMD has been suggested to be associated with other conditions or factors, with varying degrees evidence and some more commonly than others. E.g. It has been shown that 75% of people with TMD could also be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, since they met the diagnostic criteria, and that conversely, 18% of people with fibromyalgia met diagnostic criteria for TMD. A possible link between many of these chronic pain conditions has been hypothesized to be due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, and they have been collectively termed \\\" central sensitivity syndromes \\\" , although other apparent associations cannot be explained in this manner. Recently a plethora of research has substantiated a causal relationship between TMD and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Severe TMD restricts oral airway opening, and can result in a retrognathic posture that results in glossal blockage of the oropharynx as the tongue relaxes in sleep. This mechanism is exacerbated by alcohol consumption, as well as other chemicals that result in reduced myotonic status of the oropharynx. \\n\\nObstructive sleep apnea. \\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis. \\n\\nSystemic joint laxity. \\n\\nChronic back pain. \\n\\nIrritable bowel syndrome. \\n\\nHeadache. \\n\\nChronic neck pain. \\n\\nInterstitial cystitis. \\n\\nRegular scuba diving. \\n\\nThe temporomandibular joints are the dual articulation of the mandible with the skull. Each TMJ is classed as a \\\" ginglymoarthrodial \\\" joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint, and involves the condylar process of the mandible below, and the articular fossa (or glenoid fossa) of the temporal bone above. Between these articular surfaces is the articular disc (or meniscus), which is a biconcave, transversely oval disc composed of dense fibrous connective tissue. Each TMJ is covered by a fibrous capsule. There are tight fibers connecting the mandible to the disc, and loose fibers which connect the disc to the temporal bone, meaning there are in effect 2 joint capsules, creating an upper joint space and a lower joint space, with the articular disc in between. The synovial membrane of the TMJ lines the inside of the fibrous capsule apart from the articular surfaces and the disc. This membrane secretes synovial fluid, which is both a lubricant to fill the joint spaces, and a means to convey nutrients to the tissues inside the joint. Behind the disc is loose vascular tissue termed the \\\" bilaminar region \\\" which serves as a posterior attachment for the disc and also fills with blood to fill the space created when the head of the condyle translates down the articular eminence. Due to its concave shape, sometimes the articular disc is described as having an anterior band, intermediate zone and a posterior band. When the mouth is opened, the initial movement of the mandibular condyle is rotational, and this involves mainly the lower joint space, and when the mouth is opened further, the movement of the condyle is translational, involving mainly the upper joint space. This translation movement is achieved by the condylar head sliding down the articular eminence, which constitutes the front border of the articular fossa. The function of the articular eminence is to limit the forwards movement of the condyle. The ligament directly associated with the TMJ is the temporomandibular ligament, also termed the lateral ligament, which really is a thickening of the lateral aspect of the fibrous capsule. The stylomandibular ligament and the sphenomandibular ligament are not directly associated with the joint capsule. Together, these ligaments act to restrict the extreme movements of the joint. \\n\\nThe muscles of mastication are paired on each side and work together to produce the movements of the mandible. The main muscles involved are the masseter, temporalis and medial and lateral pterygoid muscles. \\n\\n<gallery mode= \\\" packed-hover \\\" heights= \\\" 160 \\\"> \\n\\nFile:Gray383.png|Left medial and lateral pterygoid muscles \\n\\nFile:Gray382.png|Left temporalis muscle \\n\\nFile:Gray378 (masseter highlight).png|Left masseter muscle (red highlight) \\n\\n</gallery> \\n\\nThey can be thought of in terms of the directions they move the mandible, with most being involved in more than one type of movement due to the variation in the orientation of muscle fibers within some of these muscles. \\n\\nProtrusion \\u2013 Lateral and medial pterygoid. \\n\\nRetraction \\u2013 Posterior fibers of temporalis (and the digastric and geniohyoid muscles to a lesser extent). \\n\\nElevation \\u2013 Anterior and middle fibers of temporalis, the superficial and deep fibers of masseter and the medial pterygoid. \\n\\nLateral movements \\u2013 Medial and lateral pterygoid (the ipsilateral temporalis and the pterygoid muscles of the contralateral side pull the mandible to the ipsilateral side). \\n\\nEach lateral pterygoid muscle is composed of 2 heads, the upper or superior head and the lower or inferior head. The lower head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts at a depression on the neck of mandibular condyle, just below the articular surface, termed the pterygoid fovea. The upper head originates from the infratemporal surface and the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The upper head also inserts at the fovea, but a part may be attached directly to the joint capsule and to the anterior and medial borders of the articular disc. The 2 parts of lateral pterygoid have different actions. The lower head contracts during mouth opening, and the upper head contracts during mouth closing. The function of the lower head is to steady the articular disc as it moves back with the condyle into the articular fossa. It is relaxed during mouth closure. \\n\\nNoises from the TMJs are a symptom of dysfunction of these joints. The sounds commonly produced by TMD are usually described as a \\\" click \\\" or a \\\" pop \\\" when a single sound is heard and as \\\" crepitation \\\" or \\\" crepitus \\\" when there are multiple, grating, rough sounds. Most joint sounds are due to internal derangement of the joint, which is instability or abnormal position of the articular disc. Clicking often accompanies either jaw opening or closing, and usually occurs towards the end of the movement. The noise indicates that the articular disc has suddenly moved to and from a temporarily displaced position (disk displacement with reduction) to allow completion of a phase of movement of the mandible. If the disc displaces and does not reduce (move back into position) this may be associated with locking. Clicking alone is not diagnostic of TMD since it is present in high proportion of the general population, mostly in people who have no pain. Crepitus often indicates arthritic changes in the joint, and may occur at any time during mandibular movement, especially lateral movements. Perforation of the disc may also cause crepitus. Due to the proximity of the TMJ to the ear canal, joint noises are perceived to be much louder to the individual than to others. Often people with TMD are surprised that what sounds to them like very loud noises cannot be heard at all by others next to them. However, it is occasionally possible for loud joint noises to be easily heard by others in some cases and this can be a source of embarrassment e.g. when eating in company. \\n\\nPain symptoms in TMD can be thought of as originating from the joint (arthralgia), or from the muscles (myofascial), or both. There is a poor correlation between TMD pain severity and evidence of tissue pathology. \\n\\nGenerally, degenerative joint changes are associated with greater pain. \\n\\nPain originating from the muscles of mastication as a result of abnormal muscular function or hyperactivity. The muscular pain is frequently, but not always, associated with daytime clenching or nocturnal bruxism. \\n\\nSometimes TMD pain can radiate or be referred from its cause (i.e. the TMJ or the muscles of mastication) and be felt as headaches, earache or toothache. \\n\\nDue to the proximity of the ear to the temporomandibular joint, TMJ pain can often be confused with ear pain. The pain may be referred in around half of all patients and experienced as otalgia (earache). Conversely, TMD is an important possible cause of secondary otalgia. Treatment of TMD may then significantly reduce symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus, as well as atypical facial pain. Despite some of these findings, some researchers question whether TMJD therapy can reduce symptoms in the ear, and there is currently an ongoing debate to settle the controversy. \\n\\nThe jaw deviates to the affected side during opening, and restricted mouth opening usually signifies that both TMJs are involved, but severe trismus rarely occurs. If the greatest reduction in movement occurs upon waking then this may indicate that there is concomitant sleep bruxism. In other cases the limitation in movement gets worse throughout the day. \\n\\nThe jaw may lock entirely. \\n\\nLimitation of mandibular movement itself may lead to further problems involving the TMJs and the muscles of mastication. Changes in the synovial membrane may lead to a reduction in lubrication of the joint and contribute to degenerative joint changes. The muscles become weak, and fibrosis may occur. All these factors may lead to a further limitation of jaw movement and increase in pain. \\n\\nDegenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis or organic degeneration of the articular surfaces, recurrent fibrous or bony ankylosis, developmental abnormality, or pathologic lesions within the TMJ. Myofascial pain syndrome. \\n\\n+ RDC/TMD criteria, axis I diagnoses. \\n\\nGroup I: muscle disorders \\n\\nIa. Myofascial pain: \\n\\nReport of pain or ache in the jaw, temples, face, preauricular area, or inside the ear at rest or during function; \\n\\nPain reported by the subject in response to palpation of 3 of the following muscle sites (right side and left side count as a separate sites for each muscle): posterior temporalis, middle temporalis, anterior temporalis, origin of masseter, insertion of masseter, posterior mandibular region, submandibular region, lateral pterygoid area, and tendon of the temporalis; \\n\\nAt least one of the painful sites must be on the same side as the complaint of pain. \\n\\nIb. Myofascial pain with limited opening: \\n\\nMyofascial pain as defined in Ia; \\n\\nPain-free unassisted mandibular opening 40 mm; \\n\\nMaximum assisted opening (passive stretch) 5 mm greater than pain-free unassisted opening. \\n\\nGroup II: disc displacements \\n\\nIIa. Disc displacement with reduction: \\n\\nReciprocal clicking in TMJ (click on both vertical opening and closing that occurs at point 5 mm greater interincisal distance on opening than closing and is eliminated on protrusive opening), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials; or \\n\\nClicking in TMJ on both vertical range of motion (either opening or closing), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials, and click during lateral excursion or protrusion, reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials. \\n\\nIIb. Disc displacement without reduction with limited opening: \\n\\nHistory of significant limitation in opening; \\n\\nMaximum unassisted opening 35 mm; \\n\\nPassive stretch increases opening by 4 mm over maximum unassisted opening; \\n\\nContralateral excursion 7 mm or uncorrected deviation to ipsilateral side on opening; \\n\\nAbsence of joint sound or presence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction. \\n\\nIIc. Disc displacement without reduction, without limited opening: \\n\\nHistory of significant limitation of mandibular opening; \\n\\nMaximum unassisted opening 35 mm; \\n\\nPassive stretch increases opening by 5 mm over maximum unassisted opening; \\n\\nContralateral excursion 7 mm; \\n\\nPresence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction; \\n\\nIn those studies allowing images, imaging conducted by either arthrography or magnetic resonance reveals disc displacement without reduction. \\n\\nGroup III: arthralgia, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis \\n\\nIIIa. Arthralgia: \\n\\nPain in one or both joint sites (lateral pole or posterior attachment) during palpation; \\n\\nOne or more of the following self-reports of pain: pain in the region of the joint, pain in the joint during maximum unassisted opening, pain in the joint during assisted opening, and pain in the joint during lateral excursion; \\n\\nFor a diagnoses of simple arthralgia, coarse crepitus must be absent. \\n\\nIIIb. Osteoarthritis of the TMJ: \\n\\nArthralgia as defined in IIIa; \\n\\nEither coarse crepitus in the joint or radiologic signs of arthrosis. \\n\\nIIIc. Osteoarthrosis of the TMJ: \\n\\nAbsence of all signs of arthralgia; \\n\\nEither coarse crepitus in the joint or radiologic signs of arthrosis \\n\\nPain is the most common reason for people with TMD to seek medical advice. \\n\\nJoint noises may require auscultation with a stethoscope to detect. Clicks of the joint may also be palpated, over the joint itself in the preauricular region, or via a finger inserted in the external acoustic meatus, which lies directly behind the TMJ. \\n\\nThe differential diagnosis is with degenerative joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, otitis media, parotitis, mandibular osteomyelitis, Eagle syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, oromandibular dystonia, deafferentation pains, and psychogenic pain. \\n\\nVarious diagnostic systems have been described. Some consider the Research Diagnostic Criteria method the gold standard. Abbreviated to \\\" RDC/TMD \\\" , this was first introduced in 1992 by Dworkin and LeResche in an attempt to classify temporomandibular disorders by etiology and apply universal standards for research into TMD. This method involves 2 diagnostic axes, namely axis I, the physical diagnosis, and axis II, the psychologic diagnosis. Axis I contains 3 different groups which can occur in combinations of 2 or all 3 groups, (see table). \\n\\nMcNeill 1997 described TMD diagnostic criteria as follows: \\n\\nPain in muscles of mastication, the TMJ, or the periauricular area (around the ear), which is usually made worse by manipulation or function. \\n\\nAsymmetric mandibular movement with or without clicking. \\n\\nLimitation of mandibular movements. \\n\\nPain present for a minimum of 3 months. \\n\\nThe International Headache Society's diagnostic criteria for \\\" headache or facial pain attributed to temporomandibular joint disorder \\\" is similar to the above: \\n\\nA. Recurrent pain in one or more regions of the head or face fulfilling criteria C and D \\n\\nB. X-ray, MRI or bone scintigraphy demonstrate TMJ disorder \\n\\nC. Evidence that pain can be attributed to the TMJ disorder, based on at least one of the following: \\n\\npain is precipitated by jaw movements or chewing of hard or tough food \\n\\nreduced range of or irregular jaw opening \\n\\nnoise from one or both TMJs during jaw movements \\n\\ntenderness of the joint capsule(s) of one or both TMJs \\n\\nD. Headache resolves within 3 months, and does not recur, after successful treatment of the TMJ disorder \\n\\nThe advantages brought about by diagnostic imaging mainly lie within diagnosing TMD of articular origin. Additional benefits of imaging the TMJ are as follows: \\n\\nAssess the integrity of anatomical structures in suspicion of disorders \\n\\nStaging the extent of any pathology \\n\\nMonitoring and staging the progress of disease \\n\\nDetermining the effects of treatment \\n\\nWhen clinical examination alone is unable to bring sufficient detail to ascertain the state of the TMJ, imaging methods can act as an adjuvant to clinical examination in the diagnosis of TMD. \\n\\nThis method of imaging allows the visualisation of the joint\\u2019s mineralised areas, therefore excluding the cartilage and soft tissues. A disadvantage of plain radiography is that images are prone to superimposition from surrounding anatomical structures, thereby complicating radiographic interpretation. It was concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of plain radiography in the diagnosis of joint erosions and osteophytes. It is reasonable to conclude that plain film can only be used to diagnose extensive lesions. \\n\\nThe distortion brought about by panoramic imaging decreases its overall reliability. Data concluded from a systematic review showed that only extensive erosions and large osteophytes can be detected by panoramic imaging. \\n\\nStudies have shown that tomography of the TMJ provided supplementary information that supersedes what is obtainable from clinical examination alone. However, the issues lies in the fact that it is impossible to determine whether certain patient groups would benefit more or less from a radiographic examination. \\n\\nThe main indications of CT and CBCT examinations are to assess the bony components of the TMJ, specifically the location and extent of any abnormalities present. \\n\\nThe introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging allowed a lower radiation dose to patients, in comparison to conventional CT. Hintze et al compared CBCT and CT techniques and their ability to detect morphological TMJ changes. No significant difference was concluded in terms of their diagnostic accuracy. \\n\\nMRI is the optimal choice for the imaging of soft tissues surrounding the TMJ. It allows three-dimensional evaluation of the axial, coronal and sagittal plane. It is the gold standard method for assessing disc position and is sensitive for intra-articular degenerative alterations. \\n\\nIndications for MRI are pre-auricular pain, detection of joint clicking and crepitus, frequent incidents of subluxation and jaw dislocation, limited mouth opening with terminal stiffness, suspicion of neoplastic growth, and osteoarthritic symptoms. It is also useful for assessing the integrity of neural tissues, which may produce orofacial pain when compressed. \\n\\nMRI provides evaluation of pathology such as necrosis and oedema all without any exposure to ionizing radiation. However, there is a high cost associated with this method of imaging, due to the need for sophisticated facilities. Caution should be taken in patient selection, as MRI is contraindicated in those with claustrophobic tendencies, pacemakers and metallic heart valves, ferromagnetic foreign bodies and pregnant women. \\n\\nWhere internal TMJ disorders are concerned, ultrasound (US) imaging can be a useful alternative in assessing the position of the disc While having significant diagnostic sensitivity, US has inadequate specificity when identifying osteoarthrosis. Moreover, it is not accurate enough for the diagnosis of cortical and articular disc morphology based on the findings done related to morphological alterations. However, with US, identification of effusion in individuals with inflammatory conditions associated with pain is possible and confirmed by MRI \\n\\nUS can be a useful alternative in initial investigation of internal TMJ dysfunctions especially in MRI contraindicated individuals despite its limitations. in addition to being less costly, US provides a quick and comfortable real-time imaging without exposing the individual to ionizing radiation \\n\\nUS is commonly assessed in the differential diagnosis of alterations of glandular and neighbouring structures, such as the TMJ and the masseter muscle. Symptoms of sialendenitis and sialothiasis cases can be confused with Eagle syndrome, TMD, myofascial and nerve pain, and other pain of the orofacial region. \\n\\nUS assessment is also indicated where there is need to identify the correct position of the joint spaces for infiltrative procedures, arthrocentesis, and viscosupplementation. This is due to the fact that US provides a dynamic and real-time location of the component of the joints, while providing adequate lubrication and washing, which can be confirmed by the joint space increase post-treatment. \\n\\nTMD can be difficult to manage, and since the disorder transcends the boundaries between several health-care disciplines \\u2014 in particular, dentistry and neurology, the treatment may often involve multiple approaches and be multidisciplinary. Most who are involved in treating and, researching TMD now agree that any treatment carried out should not permanently alter the jaw or teeth, and should be reversible. To avoid permanent change, over-the-counter or prescription pain medications may be prescribed. \\n\\nGiven the important role that psychosocial factors appear to play in TMD, psychosocial interventions could be viewed to be central to management of the condition. There is a suggestion that treatment of factors that modulate pain sensitivity such as mood disorders, anxiety and fatigue, may be important in the treatment of TMD, which often tends to attempt to address the pain directly. \\n\\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been used in TMD and has been shown to be efficacious by meta analyses. \\n\\nHypnosis is suggested by some to be appropriate for TMD. Studies have suggested that it may even be more beneficial than occlusal splint therapy, and has comparable effects to relaxation techniques. \\n\\nRelaxation techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and meditation. It has been suggested that TMD involves increased sensitivity to external stimuli leading to an increased sympathetic ( \\\" fight or flight \\\" ) response with cardiovascular and respiratory alterations. Relaxation techniques cause reduced sympathetic activity, including muscle relaxation and reducing sensitivity to external stimuli, and provoke a general sense of well being and reduced anxiety. \\n\\nOcclusal splints (also termed bite plates or intra-oral appliances) are often used by dentists to treat TMD. They are usually made of acrylic and can be hard or soft. They can be designed to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth. They may cover all the teeth in one arch (full coverage splint) or only some (partial coverage splint). Splints are also termed according to their intended mechanism, such as the anterior positioning splint or the stabilization splint. Although occlusal splints are generally considered a reversible treatment, sometimes partial coverage splints lead to pathologic tooth migration (changes in the position of teeth). Normally splints are only worn during sleep, and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep. There is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal splints in sleep bruxism than in TMD. A splint can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night. This may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt. Soft splints are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to TMD. Specific types of occlusal splint are discussed below. \\n\\nA stabilization splint is a hard acrylic splint that forces the teeth to meet in an \\\" ideal \\\" relationship for the muscles of mastication and the TMJs. It is claimed that this technique reduces abnormal muscular activity and promotes \\\" neuromuscular balance \\\" . A stabilization splint is only intended to be used for about 2\\u20133 months. It is more complicated to construct than other types of splint since a face bow record is required and significantly more skill on the part of the dental technician. This kind of splint should be properly fitted to avoid exacerbating the problem and used for brief periods of time. The use of the splint should be discontinued if it is painful or increases existing pain. A systematic review of all the scientific studies investigating the efficacy of stabilization splints concluded the following: \\n\\n<blockquote> \\\" On the basis of our analysis we conclude that the literature seems to suggest that there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilization splint therapy over other active interventions for the treatment of TMD. However, there is weak evidence to suggest that the use of stabilization splints for the treatment of TMD may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, when compared to no treatment \\\" . </blockquote> \\n\\nPartial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements, which can occasionally be severe. The mechanism of this tooth movement is that the splint effectively holds some teeth out of contact and puts all the force of the bite onto the teeth which the splint covers. This can cause the covered teeth to be intruded, and those that are not covered to over-erupted. I.e. a partial coverage splint can act as a Dahl appliance. Examples of partial coverage splints include the NTI-TSS ( \\\" nociceptive trigeminal inhibitor tension suppression system \\\" ), which covers the upper front teeth only. Due to the risks involved with long term use, some discourage the use of any type of partial coverage splint. \\n\\nAn anterior positioning splint is a splint that designed to promote an anteriorly displaced disc. It is rarely used. A 2010 review of all the scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in TMD concluded: \\n\\n<blockquote> \\\" Hard stabilization appliances, when adjusted properly, have good evidence of modest efficacy in the treatment of TMD pain compared to non-occluding appliances and no treatment. Other types of appliances, including soft stabilization appliances, anterior positioning appliances, and anterior bite appliances, have some RCT evidence of efficacy in reducing TMD pain. However, the potential for adverse events with these appliances is higher and suggests the need for close monitoring in their use. \\\" </blockquote> \\n\\nEar canal inserts are also available, but no published peer-reviewed clinical trials have shown them to be useful. \\n\\nMedication is the main method of managing pain in TMD, mostly because there is little if any evidence of the effectiveness of surgical or dental interventions. Many drugs have been used to treat TMD pain, such as analgesics (pain killers), benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazepam, prazepam, diazepam), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine), and others. Analgesics that have been studied in TMD include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. piroxicam, diclofenac, naproxen) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). Topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin have also been used. Other drugs that have been described for use in TMD include glucosamine hydrochloride/chondroitin sulphate and propranolol. Despite many randomized control trials being conducted on these commonly used medications for TMD a systematic review carried out in 2010 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or not to support the use of these drugs in TMD. Low-doses of anti-muscarinic tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or nortriptyline have also been described. In a subset of people with TMD who are not helped by either noninvasive and invasive treatments, long term use of opiate analgesics has been suggested, although these drugs carry a risk of drug dependence and other side effects. Examples include morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol, hydrocodone, and methadone. \\n\\nBotulinum toxin solution ( \\\" Botox \\\" ) is sometimes used to treat TMD. Injection of botox into the lateral pterygoid muscle has been investigated in multiple randomized control trials, and there is evidence that it is of benefit in TMD. It is theorized that spasm of lateral pterygoid causes anterior disc displacement. Botulinum toxin causes temporary muscular paralysis by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The effects usually last for a period of months before they wear off. Complications include the creation of a \\\" fixed \\\" expression due to diffusion of the solution and subsequent involvement of the muscles of facial expression, which lasts until the effects of the botox wear off. Injections of local anesthetic, sometimes combined with steroids, into the muscles (e.g. the temoralis muscle or its tendon) are also sometimes used. Local anesthetics may provide temporary pain relief, and steroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Steroids and other medications are sometimes injected directly into the joint (See Intra-articular injections). \\n\\nPhysiotherapy (physical therapy) is sometimes used as an adjuvant to other methods of treatment in TMD. There are many different approaches described, but exercises aiming to increase the range of mandibular movements are commonly involved. Jaw exercises aim to directly oppose the negative effects of disuse that may occur in TMD, due to pain discouraging people from moving their jaw. After initial instruction, people are able to perform a physical therapy regimen at home. The most simple method is by regular stretching within pain tolerance, using the thumb and a finger in a \\\" scissor \\\" maneuver. Gentle force is applied until pain of resistance is felt, and then the position is held for several seconds. Commercial devices have been developed to carry out this stretching exercise (e.g. the \\\" Therabite \\\" appliance). Over time, the amount of mouth opening possible without pain can be gradually increased. A baseline record of the distance at the start of physical therapy (e.g. the number of fingers that can be placed vertically between the upper and lower incisors), can chart any improvement over time. \\n\\nIt has been suggested that massage therapy for TMD improves both the subjective and objective health status. \\\" Friction massage \\\" uses surface pressure to causes temporary ischemia and subsequent hyperemia in the muscles, and this is hypothesized to inactivate trigger points and disrupt small fibrous adhesions within the muscle that have formed following surgery or muscular shortening due to restricted movement. \\n\\nOccasionally physiotherapy for TMD may include the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which may override pain by stimulation of superficial nerve fibers and lead to pain reduction which extends after the time where the TENS is being actually being applied, possibly due to release of endorphins. Others recommend the use of ultrasound, theorized to produce tissue heating, alter blood flow and metabolic activity at a level that is deeper than possible with surface heat applications. There is tentative evidence that low level laser therapy may help with pain. \\n\\nThe goals of a PT in reference to treatment of TMD should be to decrease pain, enable muscle relaxation, reduce muscular hyperactivity, and reestablish muscle function and joint mobility. PT treatment is non-invasive and includes self-care management in an environment to create patient responsibility for their own health. \\n\\nTherapeutic exercise and Manual Therapy (MT) are used to improve strength, coordination and mobility and to reduce pain. Treatment may focus on poor posture, cervical muscle spasms and treatment for referred cervical origin (pain referred from upper levels of the cervical spine) or orofacial pain . MT has been used to restore normal range of motion, promoting circulation, stimulate proprioception, break fibrous adhesions, stimulate synovial fluid production and reduce pain. Exercises and MT are safe and simple interventions that could potentially be beneficial for patients with TMD. No adverse events regarding exercise therapy and manual therapy have been reported. \\n\\nThere have been positive results when using postural exercises and jaw exercises to treat both myogenous (muscular) and arthrogenous (articular) TMJ dysfunction. MT alone or in combination with exercises shows promising effects. \\n\\nIt is necessary that trails be performed isolating the type of exercise and manual techniques to allow a better understanding of the effectiveness of this treatment. Additionally, details of exercise, dosage, and frequency as well as details on manual techniques should be reported to create reproducible results. High quality trails with larger sample sizes are needed. \\n\\nThere is some evidence that some people who use nighttime biofeedback to reduce nighttime clenching experience a reduction in TMD. \\n\\nThis is the adjustment or reorganizing of the existing occlusion, carried out in the belief that this will redistribute forces evenly across the dental arches or achieve a more favorable position of the condyles in the fossae, which is purported to lessen tooth wear, bruxism and TMD, but this is controversial. These techniques are sometimes termed \\\" occlusal rehabilitation \\\" or \\\" occlusal equilibration \\\" . At its simplest, occlusal adjustment involves selective grinding (with a dental drill) of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth, with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way. However, there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the exact goals. Occlusal adjustment can also be very complex, involving orthodontics, restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism. A \\\" middle ground \\\" view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of TMD is neither desirable nor helpful as a first line treatment, and furthermore, with few exceptions, any adjustments should be reversible. However, most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment, with no evidence of benefit. Specifically, orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for TMD. A systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in TMD concluded the following: \\n\\n<blockquote> \\\" There is an absence of evidence of effectiveness for occlusal adjustment. Based on these data occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD. </blockquote> \\n\\nThese conclusions were based largely on the fact that, despite many different scientific studies investigating this measure as a therapy, overall no statistically significant differences can be demonstrated between treatment with occlusal adjustment and treatment with placebo. The reviewers also stated that there are ethical implications if occlusal adjustment was found to be ineffective in preventing TMD. \\n\\nOrthodontic treatment, as described earlier, is sometimes listed as a possible predisposing factor in the development of TMD. On the other hand, orthodontic treatment is also often carried out in the belief that it may treat or prevent TMD. Another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and TMD concluded the following: \\n\\n<blockquote> \\\" There is no evidence to support or refute the use of orthodontic treatment for the treatment of TMD. In addition, there are no data which identify a link between active orthodontic intervention and the causation of TMD. Based on the lack of data, orthodontic treatment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD. \\\" </blockquote> \\n\\nA common scenario where a newly placed dental restoration (e.g. a crown or a filling) is incorrectly contoured, and creates a premature contact in the bite. This may localize all the force of the bite onto one tooth, and cause inflammation of the periodontal ligament and reversible increase in tooth mobility. The tooth may become tender to bite on. Here, the \\\" occlusal adjustment \\\" has already taken place inadvertently, and the adjustment aims to return to the pre-existing occlusion. This should be distinguished from attempts to deliberately reorganize the native occlusion. \\n\\nAttempts in the last decade to develop surgical treatments based on MRI and CAT scans now receive less attention. These techniques are reserved for the most difficult cases where other therapeutic modalities have failed. The American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends a conservative/non-surgical approach first. Only 20% of patients need to proceed to surgery. \\n\\nExamples of surgical procedures that are used in TMD, some more commonly than others, include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, meniscectomy, disc repositioning, condylotomy or joint replacement. Invasive surgical procedures in TMD may cause symptoms to worsen. Meniscectomy, also termed discectomy refers to surgical removal of the articular disc. This is rarely carried out in TMD, it may have some benefits for pain, but dysfunction may persist and overall it leads to degeneration or remodeling of the TMJ. \\n\\nAcupuncture is sometimes used for TMD. There is limited evidence that acupuncture is an effective symptomatic treatment for TMD. A short term reduction in muscular pain of muscular origin can usually be observed after acupuncture in TMD, and this is more than is seen with placebo. There are no reported adverse events of acupuncture when used for TMD, and some suggest that acupuncture is best employed as an adjuvent to other treatments in TMD. However, some suggest that acupuncture may be no more effective than sham acupuncture, that many of the studies investigating acupuncture and TMD suffer from significant risk of bias, and that the long term efficacy of acupuncture for TMD is unknown. \\n\\nChiropractic adjustments (also termed manipulations or mobilizations) are sometimes used in the belief that this will treat TMD. Related conditions that are also claimed to be treatable by chiropractic include tension headaches and neck pain. Some sources suggest that there is some evidence of efficacy of chiropractic treatment in TMD, but the sources cited for these statements were case reports and a case series of only 9 participants. One review concluded \\\" inconclusive evidence in a favorable direction regarding mobilization and massage for TMD \\\" . Overall, although there is general agreement that chiropractic may be of comparable benefit to other manual therapies for lower back pain, there is no credible evidence of efficacy in other conditions, including TMD. However, there is some evidence of possible adverse effects from cervical (neck) vertebral manipulation, which sometimes may be serious. \\n\\nIt has been suggested that the natural history of TMD is benign and self-limiting, with symptoms slowly improving and resolving over time. The prognosis is therefore good. However, the persistent pain symptoms, psychological discomfort, physical disability and functional limitations may detriment quality of life. It has been suggested that TMD does not cause permanent damage and does not progress to arthritis in later life, however degenerative disorders of the TMJ such as osteoarthritis are included within the spectrum of TMDs in some classifications. \\n\\nTMD mostly affects people in the 20 \\u2013 40 age group, and the average age is 33.9 years. People with TMD tend to be younger adults, who are otherwise healthy. Within the catchall umbrella of TMD, there are peaks for disc displacements at age 30, and for inflammatory-degenerative joint disorders at age 50. \\n\\nAbout 75% of the general population may have at least one abnormal sign associated with the TMJ (e.g. clicking), and about 33% have at least one symptom of TMD. However, only in 3.6\\u20137% will this be of sufficient severity to trigger the individual to seek medical advice. \\n\\nFor unknown reasons, females are more likely to be affected than males, in a ratio of about 2:1, although others report this ratio to be as high as 9:1. Females are more likely to request treatment for TMD, and their symptoms are less likely to resolve. Females with TMD are more likely to be nulliparous than females without TMD. It has also been reported that female caucasians are more likely to be affected by TMD, and at an earlier age, than female African Americans. \\n\\nAccording to the most recent analyses of epidemiologic data using the RDC/TMD diagnostic criteria, of all TMD cases, group I (muscle disorders) accounts for 45.3%, group II (disc displacements) 41.1%, and group III (joint disorders) 30.1% (individuals may have diagnoses from more than one group). Using the RDC/TMD criteria, TMD has a prevelence in the general population of 9.7% for group I, 11.4% for group IIa, and 2.6% for group IIIa. \\n\\nTemporomandibular disorders were described as early as ancient Egypt. An older name for the condition is \\\" Costen's syndrome \\\" , eponymously referring to James B. Costen. Costen was an otolaryngologist, and although he was not the first physician to describe TMD, he wrote extensively on the topic, starting in 1934, and was the first to approach the disorder in an integrated and systematic way. Costen hypothesized that malocclusion caused TMD, and placed emphasis on ear symptoms, such as tinnitus, otaglia, impaired hearing, and even dizziness. Specifically, Costen believed that the cause of TMD was mandibular over-closure, recommending a treatment revolving around building up the bite. The eponym \\\" Costen syndrome \\\" became commonly used shortly after his initial work, but in modern times it has been dropped, partially because occlusal factors are now thought to play little, if any, role in the development of TMD, and also because ear problems are now thought to be less associated with TMD. Other historically important terms that were used for TMD include \\\" TMJ disease \\\" or \\\" TMJ syndrome \\\" , which are now rarely used. \\n\\n\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-21T10:27:11Z\", \"text_length\": 78509}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Patent ductus arteriosus\", \"parsed_text\": \"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth: this allows a portion of oxygenated blood from the left heart to flow back to the lungs by flowing from the aorta, which has a higher pressure, to the pulmonary artery. Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased work of breathing and failure to gain weight at a normal rate. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right-sided heart failure. \\n\\nThe ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that normally closes soon after birth. In a PDA, the vessel does not close, but remains patent (open), resulting in an abnormal transmission of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. PDA is common in newborns with persistent respiratory problems such as hypoxia, and has a high occurrence in premature newborns. Premature newborns are more likely to be hypoxic and have PDA due to underdevelopment of the heart and lungs. \\n\\nIf transposition of the great vessels is present in addition to a PDA, the PDA is not surgically closed since it is the only way that oxygenated blood can mix with deoxygenated blood. In these cases, prostaglandins are used to keep the PDA open, and NSAID <nowiki/> s are not administered until surgical correction of the two defects is completed. \\n\\nCommon symptoms include: \\n\\ndyspnea (shortness of breath) \\n\\nDiarrhea (fecal matter in their pants) \\n\\nSigns include: \\n\\ntachycardia (a heart rate exceeding the normal resting rate) \\n\\ncontinuous \\\" machine-like \\\" (also described as \\\" rolling-thunder \\\" and \\\" to-and-fro \\\" ) heart murmur (usually from aorta to pulmonary artery, with higher flow during systole and lower flow during diastole) \\n\\ncardiomegaly (enlarged heart, reflecting ventricular dilation and volume overload) \\n\\nleft subclavicular thrill \\n\\nbounding pulse \\n\\nwidened pulse pressure \\n\\nincreased cardiac output \\n\\nincreased systolic pressure \\n\\npoor growth \\n\\ndifferential cyanosis, i.e. cyanosis of the lower extremities but not of the upper body. \\n\\nPatients typically present in good health, with normal respirations and heart rate. If the PDA is moderate or large, widened pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses are frequently present, reflecting increased left ventricular stroke volume and diastolic run-off of blood into the (initially lower-resistance) pulmonary vascular bed. Prominent suprasternal and carotid pulsations may be noted secondary to increased left ventricular stroke volume. \\n\\nKnown risk factors include: \\n\\nPreterm birth \\n\\nCongenital rubella syndrome \\n\\nChromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome) \\n\\nGenetic conditions such as Loeys\\u2013Dietz syndrome (would also present with other heart defects), Wiedemann\\u2013Steiner syndrome, and CHARGE syndrome. \\n\\nPDA is usually diagnosed using noninvasive techniques. Echocardiography (in which sound waves are used to capture the motion of the heart) and associated Doppler studies are the primary methods of detecting PDA. Electrocardiography (ECG), in which electrodes are used to record the electrical activity of the heart, is not particularly helpful as no specific rhythms or ECG patterns can be used to detect PDA. \\n\\nA chest X-ray may be taken, which reveals overall heart size (as a reflection of the combined mass of the cardiac chambers) and the appearance of blood flow to the lungs. A small PDA most often accompanies a normal-sized heart and normal blood flow to the lungs. A large PDA generally accompanies an enlarged cardiac silhouette and increased blood flow to the lungs. \\n\\n<gallery> \\n\\nFile:Blausen 0707 PatentDuctusArteriosus.png|Illustration of Patent Ductus Arteriosus \\n\\nImage:Heart patent ductus arteriosus.jpg|Patent ductus arteriosus \\n\\nFile:Stent tekst.jpg|An echocardiogram of a stented persisting ductus arteriosus: One can see the aortic arch and the stent leaving.

Indomethacin treatment in premature infants also may reduce the need for surgical intervention. \\n\\nNeonates without adverse symptoms may simply be monitored as outpatients, while symptomatic PDA can be treated with both surgical and non-surgical methods. Surgically, the DA may be closed by ligation (though support in premature infants is mixed), either manually tied shut, or with intravascular coils or plugs that leads to formation of a thrombus in the DA. \\n\\nDevices developed by Franz Freudenthal block the blood vessel with woven structures of nitinol wire. \\n\\nBecause prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the DA open, NSAID <nowiki/> s (which can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis) such as indomethacin or a special form of ibuprofen have been used to initiate PDA closure. Recent findings from a systematic review concluded that, for closure of a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin. It also causes fewer side effects (such as transient acute kidney injury) and reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis. A review and meta-analysis showed that paracetamol may be effective for closure of a PDA in preterm infants. A recent network meta-analysis that compared indomethacin, paracetamol and ibuprofen at different doses and administration schemes among them found that a high dose of oral ibuprofen may offer the highest likelihood of closure in preterm infants. \\n\\nWhile indomethacin can be used to close a PDA, some neonates require their PDA be kept open. Keeping a ductus arteriosus patent is indicated in neonates born with concurrent heart malformations, such as transposition of the great arteries. Drugs such as alprostadil, a PGE-1 analog, can be used to keep a PDA open until the primary defect is corrected surgically. \\n\\nIf left untreated, the disease may progress from left-to-right shunt (acyanotic heart) to right-to-left shunt (cyanotic heart), called Eisenmenger's syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension is a potential long-term outcome, which may require a heart and/or lung transplant. Another complication of PDA is intraventricular hemorrhage. \\n\\nRobert E. Gross, MD performed the first successful ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus on a seven-year-old girl at Children's Hospital Boston in 1938. \\n\\nSince PDA is usually identified in infants, it is less common in adults, but it can have serious consequences, and is usually corrected surgically upon diagnosis. \\n\\nGeorge Alexander Gibson \\n\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus Causes from US Department of Health and Human Services \\n\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus from Merck \\n\\nPatent ductus arteriosus information for parents.\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-23T16:39:21Z\", \"text_length\": 7968}\n",

      "{\"title\": \"Hypereosinophilic syndrome\", \"parsed_text\": \"Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disease characterized by a persistently elevated eosinophil count (\\u2265 1500 eosinophils/mm\\u00b3) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the heart, nervous system, or bone marrow. \\n\\nHES is a diagnosis of exclusion, after clonal eosinophilia (such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA-fusion induced hypereosinophelia and leukemia) and reactive eosinophilia (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, atopy, hypoadrenalism, tropical eosinophilia, or cancer) have been ruled out. \\n\\nThere are some associations with chronic eosinophilic leukemia as it shows similar characteristics and genetic defects. \\n\\nIf left untreated, HES is progressive and fatal. It is treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisone. The addition of the monoclonal antibody mepolizumab may reduce the dose of glucocorticoids. \\n\\nAs HES affects many organs at the same time, symptoms may be numerous. Some possible symptoms a patient may present with include: \\n\\n:Cardiomyopathy \\n\\n:Skin lesions \\n\\n:Thromboembolic disease \\n\\n:Pulmonary disease \\n\\n:Neuropathy \\n\\n:Hepatosplenomegaly \\n\\n:Reduced ventricular size \\n\\n:Atopic eczema \\n\\nNumerous techniques are used to diagnose hypereosinophilic syndrome, of which the most important is blood testing. In HES, the eosinophil count is greater than 1.5 \\u00d7 10 <sup> 9 </sup> /L. On some smears the eosinophils may appear normal in appearance, but morphologic abnormalities, such as a lowering of granule numbers and size, can be observed. Roughly 50% of patients with HES also have anaemia. \\n\\nSecondly, various imaging and diagnostic technological methods are utilised to detect defects to the heart and other organs, such as valvular dysfunction and arrhythmias by usage of echocardiography. Chest radiographs may indicate pleural effusions and/or fibrosis, and neurological tests such as CT scans can show strokes and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. \\n\\nA proportion of patients have a mutation involving the PDGFRA and FIP1L1 genes on the fourth chromosome, leading to a tyrosine kinase fusion protein. Testing for this mutation is now routine practice, as its presence indicates response to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. \\n\\nTreatment primarily consists of reducing eosinophil levels and preventing further damage to organs. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are good for reducing eosinophil levels and antineoplastics are useful for slowing eosinophil production. Surgical therapy is rarely utilised, however splenectomy can reduce the pain due to spleen enlargement. If damage to the heart (in particular the valves), then prosthetic valves can replace the current organic ones. Follow-up care is vital for the survival of the patient, as such the patient should be checked for any signs of deterioration regularly. After promising results in drug trials (95% efficiency in reducing blood eosinophil count to acceptable levels) it is hoped that in the future hypereosinophilic syndrome, and diseases related to eosinophils such as asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, may be treated with the monoclonal antibody mepolizumab currently being developed to treat the disease. If this becomes successful, it may be possible for corticosteroids to be eradicated and thus reduce the amount of side effects encountered. \\n\\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) estimated the prevalence of HES at the time of granting orphan drug designation for HES in 2004 at 1.5 in 100,000 people, corresponding to a current prevalence of about 8,000 in the EU, 5,000 in the U.S., and 2,000 in Japan. \\n\\nPatients who lack chronic heart failure and those who respond well to prednisone or a similar drug have a good prognosis.

      "{\"title\": \"Pellagra\", \"parsed_text\": \" \\n\\nPellagra is a disease caused by a lack of the vitamin niacin (vitamin B <sub> 3 </sub> ). Symptoms include inflamed skin, diarrhea, dementia, and sores in the mouth. Areas of the skin exposed to either sunlight or friction are typically affected first. Over time affected skin may become darker, stiff, begin to peel, or bleed. \\n\\nThere are two main types of pellagra, primary and secondary. Primary pellagra is due to a diet that does not contain enough niacin and tryptophan. Secondary pellagra is due to a poor ability to use the niacin within the diet. This can occur as a result of alcoholism, long-term diarrhea, carcinoid syndrome, Hartnup disease, and a number of medications such as isoniazid. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and may be assisted by urine testing. \\n\\nTreatment is with either niacin or nicotinamide supplementation. Improvements typically begin within a couple of days. General improvements in diet are also frequently recommended. Decreasing sun exposure via sunscreen and proper clothing is important while the skin heals. Without treatment death may occur. The disease occurs most commonly in the developing world, specifically sub-Saharan Africa. \\n\\nThe classic symptoms of pellagra are diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death ( \\\" the four Ds \\\" ). \\n\\nA more comprehensive list of symptoms includes: \\n\\nSensitivity to sunlight \\n\\nDermatitis (characteristic \\\" broad collar \\\" rash known as casal collar) \\n\\nHair loss \\n\\nSwelling \\n\\nSmooth, beefy red glossitis (tongue inflammation) \\n\\nTrouble sleeping \\n\\nWeakness \\n\\nMental confusion or aggression \\n\\nAtaxia (lack of coordination), paralysis of extremities, peripheral neuritis (nerve damage) \\n\\nDiarrhea \\n\\nDilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged, weakened heart) \\n\\nEventually dementia \\n\\nJ. Frostig and Tom Spies (acc. to Cleary and Cleary) described more specific psychological symptoms of pellagra as: \\n\\nPsychosensory disturbances (impressions as being painful, annoying bright lights, odors intolerance causing nausea and vomiting, dizziness after sudden movements) \\n\\nPsychomotor disturbances (restlessness, tense and a desire to quarrel, increased preparedness for motor action) \\n\\nEmotional disturbances \\n\\nIndependently of clinical symptoms, blood level of tryptophan or urinary metabolites such as 2-pyridone/N-methylniacinamide ratio <2 or NAD/NADP ratio in red blood cells can diagnose pellagra. The diagnosis is confirmed by rapid improvements in symptoms after doses of niacin (250\\u2013500 mg/day) or niacin enriched food. \\n\\nPellagra can develop according to several mechanisms, classically as a result of niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, which results in decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Since NAD and its phosphorylated NADP form are cofactors required in many body processes, the pathological impact of pellagra is broad and results in death if not treated. \\n\\nThe first mechanism is simple dietary lack of niacin. Second, it may result from deficiency of tryptophan, an essential amino acid found in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and peanuts that the body uses to make niacin. Third, it may be caused by excess leucine, as it inhibits quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT) and inhibits the formation of niacin or nicotinic acid to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) causing pellagra like symptoms to occur. \\n\\nSome conditions can prevent the absorption of dietary niacin or tryptophan and lead to pellagra. Inflammation of the jejunum or ileum can prevent nutrient absorption, leading to pellagra, and this can in turn be caused by Crohn's disease. Gastroenterostomy can also cause pellagra. Chronic alcoholism can also cause poor absorption which combines with a diet already low in niacin and tryptophan to produce pellagra. Hartnup disease is a genetic disorder that reduces tryptophan absorption, leading to pellagra. \\n\\nAlterations in protein metabolism may also produce pellagra-like symptoms. An example is carcinoid syndrome, a disease in which neuroendocrine tumors along the GI tract use tryptophan as the source for serotonin production, which limits the available tryptophan for niacin synthesis. In normal patients, only one percent of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin; however, in patients with carcinoid syndrome, this value may increase to 70%. Carcinoid syndrome thus may produce niacin deficiency and clinical manifestations of pellagra. Anti-tuberculosis medication tends to bind to vitamin B <sub> 6 </sub> and reduce niacin synthesis, since B <sub> 6 </sub> (pyridoxine) is a required cofactor in the tryptophan-to-niacin reaction. \\n\\nSeveral therapeutic drugs can provoke pellagra. These include the antibiotics isoniazid, which decreases available B <sub> 6 </sub> by binding to it and making it inactive, so it cannot be used in niacin synthesis, and chloramphenicol; the anti-cancer agent fluorouracil; and the immunosuppressant mercaptopurine. \\n\\nIf untreated, pellagra can kill within four or five years. Treatment is with nicotinamide, which has the same vitamin function as niacin and a similar chemical structure, but has lower toxicity. The frequency and amount of nicotinamide administered depends on the degree to which the condition has progressed. \\n\\nPellagra can be common in people who obtain most of their food energy from corn, notably rural South America, where maize is a staple food. If maize is not nixtamalized, it is a poor source of tryptophan, as well as niacin. Nixtamalization corrects the niacin deficiency, and is a common practice in Native American cultures that grow corn. Following the corn cycle, the symptoms usually appear during spring, increase in the summer due to greater sun exposure, and return the following spring. Indeed, pellagra was once endemic in the poorer states of the U.S. South, such as Mississippi and Alabama, where its cyclical appearance in the spring after meat-heavy winter diets led to it being known as \\\" spring sickness \\\" (particularly when it appeared among more vulnerable children), as well as among the residents of jails and orphanages as studied by Dr. Joseph Goldberger. \\n\\nPellagra is common in Africa, Indonesia, and China. In affluent societies, a majority of patients with clinical pellagra are poor, homeless, alcohol-dependent, or psychiatric patients who refuse food. Pellagra was common among prisoners of Soviet labor camps (the Gulag). In addition, pellagra, as a micronutrient deficiency disease, frequently affects populations of refugees and other displaced people due to their unique, long-term residential circumstances and dependence on food aid. Refugees typically rely on limited sources of niacin provided to them, such as groundnuts; the instability in the nutritional content and distribution of food aid can be the cause of pellagra in displaced populations. In the 2000s, there were outbreaks in countries such as Angola, Zimbabwe and Nepal. In Angola specifically, recent reports show a similar incidence of pellagra since 2002 with clinical pellagra in 0.3% of women and 0.2% of children and niacin deficiency in 29.4% of women and 6% of children related to high untreated corn consumption. \\n\\nIn other countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, even with sufficient intake of niacin, cases have been reported. In this case deficiency might happen not just because of poverty or malnutrition but secondary to alcoholism, drug interaction (psychotropic, cytostatic, tuberculostatic or analgesics), HIV, vitamin B <sub> 2 </sub> and B <sub> 6 </sub> deficiency, or malabsorption syndromes such as Hartnup disease and carcinoid. \\n\\nThe native New World cultivators who first domesticated corn (maize) prepared it by nixtamalization, in which the grain is treated with a solution of alkali such as lime. Nixtamalization makes the niacin nutritionally available and prevents pellagra. When maize was cultivated worldwide, and eaten as a staple without nixtamalization, pellagra became common. \\n\\nPellagra was first described for its dermatological effect in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He explained that the disease causes dermatitis in exposed skin areas such as hands, feet and neck and that the origin of the disease is poor diet and atmospheric influences. His work published in 1762 by his friend Juan Sevillano was titled \\u2018Historia Natural y Medicina del Principado de Asturias\\u2019 or Natural and Medical History of the Principality of Asturias (1762). This led to the disease being known as \\\" Asturian leprosy \\\" , and it is recognized as the first modern pathological description of a syndrome. It was an endemic disease in northern Italy, where it was named, from Lombard, as \\\" pell agra \\\" (agra = holly-like or serum-like; pell = skin). by Francesco Frapolli of Milan. With pellagra affecting over 100,000 people in Italy by the 1880s, debates raged as to how to classify the disease (as a form of scurvy, elephantiasis or as something new), and over its causation. In the 19th century Roussel started a campaign in France to restrict consumption of maize and eradicated the disease in France, but it remained endemic in many rural areas of Europe. Because pellagra outbreaks occurred in regions where maize was a dominant food crop, the most convincing hypothesis during the late nineteenth century, as espoused by Cesare Lombroso, was that the maize either carried a toxic substance or was a carrier of disease. Louis Sambon, an Anglo-Italian doctor working at the London School of Tropical Medicine, was convinced that pellagra was carried by an insect, along the lines of malaria. Later, the lack of pellagra outbreaks in Mesoamerica, where maize is a major food crop, led researchers to investigate processing techniques in that region. \\n\\nPellagra was studied mostly in Europe until the late 19th century when it became an epidemic especially in the southern United States. In the early 1900s, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in the American South. Between 1906 and 1940 more than 3 million Americans were affected by pellagra with more than 100,000 deaths, yet the epidemic resolved itself right after dietary niacin fortification. Pellagra deaths in South Carolina numbered 1,306 during the first ten months of 1915; 100,000 Southerners were affected in 1916. At this time, the scientific community held that pellagra was probably caused by a germ or some unknown toxin in corn. The Spartanburg Pellagra Hospital in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was the nation's first facility dedicated to discovering the cause of pellagra. It was established in 1914 with a special congressional appropriation to the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and set up primarily for research. In 1915, Joseph Goldberger, assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States, showed it was linked to diet by observing the outbreaks of pellagra in orphanages and mental hospitals. Goldberger noted that children between the ages of 6 and 12 (but not older or younger children at the orphanages) and patients at the mental hospitals (but not doctors or nurses) were the ones who seemed most susceptible to pellagra. Goldberger theorized that a lack of meat, milk, eggs, and legumes made those particular populations susceptible to pellagra. By modifying the diet served in these institutions with \\\" a marked increase in the fresh animal and the leguminous protein foods, \\\" Goldberger was able to show that pellagra could be prevented. By 1926, Goldberger established that a diet that included these foods, or a small amount of brewer's yeast, prevented pellagra. \\n\\nGoldberger experimented on 11 prisoners (one was dismissed because of prostatitis). Before the experiment, the prisoners were eating the prison fare fed to all inmates at Rankin Prison Farm in Mississippi. Goldberger started feeding them a restricted diet of grits, syrup, mush, biscuits, cabbage, sweet potatoes, rice, collards, and coffee with sugar (no milk). Healthy white male volunteers were selected as the typical skin lesions were easier to see in Caucasians and this population was felt to be those least susceptible to the disease, and thus provide the strongest evidence that the disease was caused by a nutritional deficiency. Subjects experienced mild, but typical cognitive and gastrointestinal symptoms, and within five months of this cereal-based diet, 6 of the 11 subjects broke out in the skin lesions that are necessary for a definitive diagnosis of pellagra. The lesions appeared first on the scrotum. Goldberger was not given the opportunity to experimentally reverse the effects of diet-induced pellagra as the prisoners were released shortly after the diagnoses of pellagra were confirmed. In the 1920s he connected pellagra to the corn-based diets of rural areas rather than infection as contemporary medical opinion would suggest. Goldberger believed that the root cause of pellagra amongst Southern farmers was limited diet resulting from poverty, and that social and land reform would cure epidemic pellagra. His reform efforts were not realized, but crop diversification in the Southern United States, and the accompanying improvement in diet, dramatically reduced the risk of pellagra. Goldberger is remembered as the \\\" unsung hero of American clinical epidemiology \\\" . Though he identified that a missing nutritional element was responsible for pellagra, he did not discover the specific vitamin responsible. \\n\\nIn 1937, Conrad Elvehjem, a biochemistry professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showed that the vitamin niacin cured pellagra (manifested as black tongue) in dogs. Later studies by Dr. Tom Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin also cured pellagra in humans, for which Time Magazine dubbed them its 1938 Men of the Year in comprehensive science. \\n\\nResearch conducted between 1900 and 1950 found the number of cases of women with pellagra was consistently double the number of cases of afflicted men. This is thought to be due to the inhibitory effect of estrogen on the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan to niacin. Some researchers of the time gave a few explanations regarding the difference. \\n\\nGillman and Gillman related skeletal tissue and pellagra in their research in South African Blacks. They provide some of the best evidence for skeletal manifestations of pellagra and the reaction of bone in malnutrition. They claimed radiological studies of adult pellagrins demonstrated marked osteoporosis. A negative mineral balance in pellagrins was noted, which indicated active mobilization and excretion of endogenous mineral substances, and undoubtedly impacted the turnover of bone. Extensive dental caries were present in over half of pellagra patients. In most cases, caries were associated with \\\" severe gingival retraction, sepsis, exposure of cementum, and loosening of teeth \\\" . \\n\\nThe word is likely a coined scientific term based on Latin , skin and the Greek suffix -agra, seized by as in . \\n\\nAlternatively, pellagra may be an Italian or more precisely, Lombard coinage. \\n\\nPellagra was first reported in 1902 in the United States, and has \\\" caused more deaths than any other nutrition-related disease in American history \\\" , reaching epidemic proportions in the American South during the early 1900s. Poverty and consumption of corn were the most frequently observed risk factors, but the exact cause was not known, until groundbreaking work by Joseph Goldberger. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper explored the role of cotton production in the emergence of disease; one prominent theory is that \\\" widespread cotton production displaced local production of niacin-rich foods and driven poor Southern farmers and mill workers to consume milled Midwestern corn, which was relatively cheap but also devoid of the niacin necessary to prevent pellagra. \\\" The study provided evidence in favor of the theory: there were lower pellagra rates in areas where farmers had been forced to abandon cotton production (a highly profitable crop) in favor of food crops (less profitable crops) due to boll weevil infestation of cotton crops (which occurred randomly). \\n\\nThe whole dried corn kernel contains a nutritious germ and a thin seed coat that provides some fiber. \\n\\nThere are two important considerations for using ground whole-grain corn. \\n\\nThe germ contains oil that is exposed by grinding, thus whole-grain cornmeal and grits turn rancid quickly at room temperature and should be refrigerated. \\n\\nWhole-grain cornmeal and grits require extended cooking times as seen in the following cooking directions for whole-grain grits; \\n\\n<blockquote> \\\" Place the grits in a pan and cover them with water. Allow the grits to settle a full minute, tilt the pan, and skim off and discard the chaff and hulls with a fine tea strainer. Cook the grits for 50 minutes if the grits were soaked overnight or else 90 minutes if not. \\\" </blockquote> \\n\\nMost of the niacin in mature cereal grains is present as niacytin, which is niacin bound up in a complex with hemicellulose which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total niacin content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this niacin nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn in the preparation of cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the niacin content of the cornmeal. \\n\\nCasimir Funk, who helped elucidate the role of thiamin in the etiology of beriberi, was an early investigator of the problem of pellagra. Funk suggested that a change in the method of milling corn was responsible for the outbreak of pellagra, but no attention was paid to his article on this subject. \\n\\nPellagra developed especially among the vulnerable populations in institutions such as orphanages and prisons, because of the monotonous and restricted diet. Soon pellagra began to occur in epidemic proportions in states south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. The pellagra epidemic lasted for nearly four decades beginning in 1906. It was estimated that there were 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths due to pellagra during the epidemic. \\n\\nGeorge Sessions Perry\\u2019s 1941 novel Hold Autumn in Your Handand Jean Renoir's 1945 film adaptation of it, The Southernerincorporates pellagra ( \\\" spring sickness \\\" ) as a major plot element in the story of an impoverished Texas farm family. \\n\\nCentral chromatolysis \\n\\nHarriette Chick \\n\\nZeism \\n\\nKraut, Alan. \\\" Dr. Joseph Goldberger and the War on Pellagra, By Alan Kraut, Ph.D. \\\" Office of History, National Institutes of Health. 3 Sept. 2010. \\n\\nPellagraFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-12-28T14:08:38Z\", \"text_length\": 22217}\n",
