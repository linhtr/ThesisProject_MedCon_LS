{"title": "Bubonic plague", "parsed_text": "Bubonic plague is the best-known form of the disease plague, which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the lymphatic system. \n\nIf the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the Middle Ages. \n\nSymptoms of this disease include coughing, fever, and black spots on the skin. \n\nThere are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea, that lives on rats. Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days. \n\nSepsis happens when the bacterium enters the blood and makes it form tiny clots. \n\nThis happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days. \n\nThis is the most harmless form. It will result in a little fever. After that, there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time. \n\nThe first recorded epidemic was in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), It was called the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment. The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence). \n\nDuring the 1300s, this epidemic struck parts of Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the time, described it: \" This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children \" . \n\nLocal outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague pandemics, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion. The pandemics were: \n\nthe first plague pandemic from 541 to ~750, spreading from Egypt to the Mediterranean (starting with the Plague of Justinian) and northwestern Europe \n\nthe second plague pandemic from ~1331 to ~1855, spreading from Central Asia to the Mediterranean and Europe (starting with the Black Death), and probably also to China \n\nthe third plague pandemic from 1855 to 1960, spreading from China to various places around the world, notably India and the West Coast of the United States. \n\nGlobally about 600 cases of plague are reported a year. In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. \n\nThe transmission of Y. pestis by fleas is well known. Fleas are the vector. The flea gets the bacteria as they feed on an infected animal, usually a rodent. Several proteins then work to keep the bacteria in the flea digestive tract. This is important for the survival of Y. pestis in fleas. \n\nIn the 20th century, some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for biological warfare. \n\nSamples of this bacteria are carefully controlled. There is much paranoia (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes. This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-12T18:16:30Z", "text_length": 5326}
{"title": "Diarrhea", "parsed_text": "Diarrhea (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled diarrhoea, happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal. Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals \n\nDiarrhea is not a disease. But it may be a symptom of a disease. The most common causes of diarrhea are: \n\nViruses, like Norovirus (the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis\u2014 \" stomach flu \" \u2014in humans) \n\nBacteria, like E. coli or C. diff \n\nSome medicines, especially antibiotics \n\nFood poisoning \n\nLactose intolerance \n\nArtificial sweeteners, like sorbitol and mannitol, which are in many sugar-free food products like sugarless gum \n\nOther problems with the intestines, like Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome \n\nIn developing nations, diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5. Every year in the world, diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under age 5. \n\nIn developing countries, diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age 5. \n\nWhen children die from diarrhea, the cause is often dehydration (losing too much water from the body). Because diarrhea is watery, it takes away a lot of the water. It also takes away electrolytes\u2014important salts that the body needs to survive. Dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with. This means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems. \n\nIn developing countries, diarrhea is usually caused by an infection in the intestines. These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. These infections spread easily in some developing countries because of the following reasons: \n\nUnsafe drinking water. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites often get into the water, which people then have to drink. Anyone who drinks the water can then get an infection that causes diarrhea. \n\nSanitation, with clean toilets, is often not available. This makes it easier for infections to spread. \n\nClean water and soap for washing hands are often not available, either. If people cannot wash their hands, bacteria, viruses, or parasites can stay on their hands. These microbes can then enter the mouth or get spread to other people with handshaking. \n\nChild deaths from diarrhea can be prevented in different ways. \n\nWhen a child is sick with diarrhea, the best way to keep them from dying is to rehydrate them (give them the water and electrolytes (salts) they are losing by having diarrhea). If the child can go to a clinic or hospital, this can be done by giving water and salts intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). \n\nIf the child cannot go to a clinic or hospital, oral rehydration solution can be used. ( \" Oral \" means \" given by mouth \" ; a \" solution \" is a mixture.) Oral rehydration solution is a mixture of the most important things the body loses when it is dehydrated. These things are clean water, salt, and sugar. Some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes, like potassium, in them also. \n\nSome oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water. Oral rehydration solution can also be made at home. If the water in the area is not safe, it can be boiled to make it safe. (Boiling the water will kill any bacteria, viruses, or parasites in the water.) Salt and sugar are then mixed into the water. Drinking this mixture, after the water cools, will re-hydrate the child, if he drinks enough. Adding a banana or orange juice can add potassium to the mixture. \n\nBreast milk will also re-hydrate a child with diarrhea. \n\nThere are some ways to prevent diarrhea, or the spread of diseases that cause diarrhea. However, some of these ways are expensive and difficult to do. These include: \n\nMaking drinking water safe \n\nMaking sanitation better \n\nMaking clean water and soap available for hand washing \n\nFeces \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-02-04T17:23:27Z", "text_length": 4464}
{"title": "Scurvy", "parsed_text": "Scurvy is a disease (sickness). It is caused by not eating enough vitamin C. But scurvy can be prevented. It has many symptoms. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs. Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out. They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucus membranes). A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see depression). They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt. \n\nScurvy can be easily cured. Oranges and other fruits can restore vitamins. In the past, sailors more commonly got scurvy. Fresh fruit could not be kept for long.The main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. It is uncommon today. \n\nAt first, a person with scurvy may: \n\n#Not want to eat (loss of appetite) \n\n#Feel sad (slight depression) \n\n#Lose weight or not get heavier even though they eat a lot \n\n#Have loose feces (diarrhea) \n\n#Breathe fast (tachypnea) \n\n#Be hot (have a high body temperature or fever) \n\nA bit later a person with scurvy may: \n\n#Feel angry (irritability) \n\n#Have pains in the legs (and tenderness) \n\n#Find it hard to move (pseudo paralysis) \n\n#Have swelling of the arms and legs \n\n#Bleed from the mouth, nose and gums \n\n#Not eating enough food that has vitamin C \n\n#Going on a long trip, often at sea, where there is no fresh food \n\n#Not having enough food (famine) \n\n#Breaking down the vitamin C by over-cooking (like boiling fruit juice) \n\n#Eating vitamin C pills or giving it by needle (injection, also known as a shot). The injection almost always cures scurvy in babies. \n\n#Drinking orange juice is another treatment that works in babies. Before vitamin C was discovered this was the only treatment. \n\nWhen a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly. Babies start eating again after one or two days of help. The symptoms get better within seven days. \n\nEating vitamin C prevents scurvy. How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women. The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council's advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day: \n\nInfants (babies): 30\u201340 mg \n\nChildren and adults: 45\u201360 mg \n\nPregnant women: 70 mg \n\nMothers breast feeding: 90\u201395 mg \n\nFoods with a lot of vitamin C include the following: \n\nCitrus fruits (for example: oranges, limes) \n\nBerries \n\nCantaloupe \n\nBroccoli \n\nCauliflower \n\nCabbage \n\nSpinach \n\nPotatoes \n\nTomatoes \n\nStrawberries \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-02-16T20:40:38Z", "text_length": 2738}
{"title": "Schizophrenia", "parsed_text": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness. \n\nPeople with this disorder often do not behave the way most people do towards others. They also may not know what is real (this is called psychosis). Some common signs are strange beliefs, unclear or confused thinking and language, hallucinations (such as hearing voices that aren't there), poor interaction with others, less expression of feelings, and not doing much. \n\nThe word schizophrenia comes from two Greek words that mean to split and mind, because there is a 'split' between what's going on in the person's mind and what is actually happening. A person with schizophrenia does not change between different personalities: they have only one. The condition in which a person has more than one personality, meaning they act like a different person at different times, is dissociative identity disorder. There are no medical tests that can be used to say if a person has schizophrenia or not, so getting a diagnosis depends on which list of symptoms are used. It also depends on the doctor or psychologist who talks to the person. The lists of symptoms include wording like \" Disorganized [not organized, or oddly organized] speech present for a significant portion of time \" . It is difficult to agree on what exactly \" disorganized speech \" is and how disorganized it has to be. It is also difficult to agree on how long a \" significant portion of time \" is. Because of this, two doctors or psychologists trying to make a diagnosis may often disagree. One will say that the person is schizophrenic and the other will say he or she is not. \n\nSchizophrenia has many different symptoms, and not everyone with schizophrenia has all of them. For this reason, some scientists think that schizophrenia is several separate illnesses that have some of the same symptoms. These scientists claim that the research done on schizophrenia is not accurate since different researchers mean different things when they use the word \" schizophrenia \" in scientific studies. \n\nMany medications (licensed drugs to cure or treat an illness) may also cause the same symptoms as schizophrenia. The most common ones are antidepressants (medicines to treat depression) and ADHD medication (medication to treat ADHD, a condition affecting the brain, including memory and focusing on surroundings.) If a person has taken anti-vomiting medication (medication to stop them being sick) for some time and suddenly stops, he or she may get schizophrenia symptoms. Hundreds of medications have schizophrenia symptoms as rare side effects (unintended effects of taking them). Illegal drugs such as LSD, amphetamines, magic mushrooms and cocaine may cause schizophrenia symptoms. \n\nMedical illnesses, and treatment with certain medicines, can cause symptoms very similar to that of schizophrenia. In fact, there are over a hundred medical problems that can cause the same symptoms of schizophrenia. For this reason, it is important to rule out the possibility of either of these things being the cause for the person's symptoms. For this reason, the person should have a thorough medical exam to rule out problems like; \n\nNot having enough vitamin B12, magnesium, sodium, or other chemicals the body needs \n\nSleep disorders \n\nA stroke or brain tumor \n\nA metabolism (chemical reactions keeping the person alive) that is too high or too low \n\nPeople with schizophrenia often have delusions or hallucinations. A schizophrenic delusion is a belief that is very different from what other people with the same way of life believe. Hallucinations are usually experiences of hearing voices that don't exist. These voices often say unpleasant things to the person. Many people can hear voices like this without being schizophrenic, for instance right before falling asleep. This is called a hypnagogic hallucination. The brain cannot tell them apart from normal sounds that are heard. This is not yet fully understood by science. \n\nThere are many risk factors that may cause a person to develop schizophrenia. They include trauma (damage caused by stressful events) and genetics (schizophrenia running in families). Having a schizophrenic parent may be very stressful, and there may also be genes that influence the development of schizophrenia. It is very easy to show that trauma, such as sexual abuse (forced unwanted sexual behaviour towards somebody) increases the risk, but 40 years of searching for the right genes has not found anything that has been confirmed by independent research groups. \n\nPeople with schizophrenia may also have other mental health disorders, like depression, anxiety and drug abuse. They often have problems functioning in society, and have difficulty keeping a job. However, there are a number of people with schizophrenia who get well and have earned college degrees and had professional careers. For example, Elyn. R. Saks successfully became a law professor at the University of Southern California and a published author. \n\nIn a family treatment called \" Open dialog \" in Finland, eight out of every ten people with schizophrenia \" get well. \" In developing countries, where doctors use less drugs, 2 out of 3 patients get well from schizophrenia. In western countries, where medications are used as treatment, 1 of 3 get well, but many suffer from drug side effects such as diabetes, obesity, and brain damage. \n\nTreatment of schizophrenia may include medication to help treat the symptoms, different types of psychotherapy (therapy by a professional), such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and many rehabilitation therapies (therapies restoring things to how they were before), such as cognitive remediation therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, is a talk therapy that focuses on helping the person to think about their strange ideas (delusions) in more realistic ways. \n\nThe therapist may design a behavioral experiment for paranoia (false beliefs of danger) that will help the person to find out for example, if there really are cameras everywhere in the house. For hallucinations, cognitive therapy focuses on normalizing: many people hear voices without being stressed, and we all hear voices in the form of thoughts, it is just that people with schizophrenia hear them a bit more clearly than most people. \n\nDuring treatment of Schizophrenia, family role of patient is very important. Suppose there are 4 members in family. Every member is suffering from this shock. Patient generally feel confusion that he is ill or people around him/her are ill. He/her will never agree that he/she is actually ill. Some time family members are also confused that who is actually ill. So, in this case very common trick adopted by doctors is that during appointment, appointment is registered at which family member name. So, he/she is actually a patient. Family role of patient is also important in other way also. If some injustice is done with patient in past or any lack of love in his/her previous life, its fulfillment can be done during this treatment period. \n\nThe British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) suggest the following treatments: \n\nCheck for reactions to traumatic experiences \n\nDecide together with a doctor about using medication, taking into account the side effect risk of getting diabetes, becoming seriously overweight, getting brain damage (tardive dyskinesia, 5% risk pr year), men growing breasts, and feelings described as inner torture (akathesia). \n\nThe guidelines also warn against using more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time. Both for people who are at risk for getting schizophrenia and for people who have got it, they recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy. Getting support from people who have become well from schizophrenia is also strongly recommended. \n\n</ref> In a family oriented treatment program in Finland, Open Dialog, 8 out of 10 people with schizophrenia get well with no medication or very limited drug use, often only with anxiety medication. \n\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. \n\n;Positive symptoms \n\nPositive symptoms are thoughts, behaviors, or anything experienced by the senses that are not shared by others - like hearing voices that are not really there. They are called 'positive' not because they are good but because they are \" added on \" . These symptoms may include having strange thoughts that do not make sense (delusions), disorganized thoughts and speech, and feeling, hearing, seeing, smelling, or tasting things that do not exist (hallucinations). Positive symptoms often respond to drug treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT. Stopping anti-psychotic or anti-vomiting drugs too quickly may also cause these symptoms. \n\n;Negative symptoms \n\nNegative symptoms are thoughts, behaviors or emotions normally present in a healthy person that a person with a mental disorder has less of or may not have at all; they are 'minus' these. The sign for minus is -; it is also the sign for the word \" negative \" . Negative symptoms includes a 'flat affect'; having a blank inexpressive look on the face and/or monosyllabic speech (speech always sounding the same) spoken in a slow monotone, few gestures, lack of interest in anything including other people, and an inability to act spontaneously or feel pleasure. These problems are also side effects of anti-psychoctic drugs. They may also be symptoms of many medical problems such as a metabolism that is too low. \n\n;Cognitive symptoms (or cognitive deficits) \n\nCognitive symptoms are problems with attention, certain types of memory, a \n\nthe concept of time, and with the ability to plan and organize. Cognitive deficits caused by schizophrenia can also be difficult to recognize as part of the disorder. They are the most disabling of the symptoms because cognitive problems affect everyday functioning. These problems may also be side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, antidepressants, sleeping medication and anti-anxiety drugs. \n\nA combination of what has happened to a person and the person\u2019s genes may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. People who have family members with schizophrenia and who experienced a brief period of psychotic symptoms have a 20 to 40 percent chance of being diagnosed one year later. This may be both the result of stressful events because of the family member and possibly a genetic effect. \n\n;Inherited factors \n\nIt is difficult to know if schizophrenia is inherited because it is hard to find out whether something comes from genes or the environment. Those who have a parent, a brother or sister with schizophrenia have a higher risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk is even higher if you have an identical twin with schizophrenia. This may seem to show that schizophrenia is inherited. However, it may be the stress of living with a schizophrenic family member that is traumatic. Identical twins are much closer and are treated much more in the same way, and this may be the reason why one of them is more likely to get schizophrenia if the other has it. Dr Jay Joseph has found many problems with the scientific studies of inheriting schizophrenia, including false reporting of results. Joseph also claims that 40 years of the search for the schizophrenia gene has not found a single gene that independent research groups have confirmed. \n\n;Environmental factors \n\nThere are may environmental risk factors factors for schizophrenia such as drug use, stress before birth and in some cases exposure to infectious diseases (a disease that spreads from person to person). In addition, living in a city during childhood or as an adult has been found to double the risk of schizophrenia . This is true even after taking into account drug use, race, and the size of one\u2019s social group. Other factors that play an important role include whether the person feels socially isolated, as well as social adversity, racial discrimination (treating a person badly because of their race), the person's family not working properly, unemployment, and poor housing conditions. There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life. \n\n;Substance abuse \n\nSeveral drugs have been linked with the development of schizophrenia and the abuse (harmful use) of certain drugs can cause symptoms like those of schizophrenia. About half of those people who have schizophrenia use too much drugs or alcohol, possibly to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, or loneliness. Frequent marijuana use may double the risk of serious mental illness, including schizophrenia. \n\n;Smoking \n\nMore people with schizophrenia smoke than the general population; it is estimated that at least 60% to as many as 90% of people with schizophrenia smoke. Recent research suggests that cigarette smoking may be a risk factor for developing schizophrenia. Smoking also reduces the effects and side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, and this may be one of the reasons for the high smoking rate. Patients taking anti-psychotic drugs die up to 20 years earlier than others, possibly because the medication makes them overweight, gives diabetes and leads to them smoking. \n\n;Pre-birth factors \n\nFactors such as lack of oxygen, infection, or stress and lack of healthy foods in the mother during pregnancy, might result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People who have schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern half of the world). This might relate to increased rates of exposures to viruses before birth. This difference is about 5 to 8 percent. \n\n;Brain structure \n\nSome people who have schizophrenia have differences in their brain structure compared to those who do not have the disorder. These differences are often in the parts of the brain that manage memory, organization, emotions, the control of impulsive behavior, and language. For example, there is less brain volume in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes, and problems within the corpus callosum, the band of nerve fibers which connects the left side and the right side of the brain. People with schizophrenia also tend to have larger lateral and third ventricles. The ventricles are spaces within the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid. \n\n;Brain wiring \n\nThe human brain has 100 billion neurons; each one of these neurons are connected to many other neurons. One neuron may have as many as 20,000 connections; there is between 100 trillion and 500 trillion neural connections in the adult human brain. There are many different parts or 'regions' of the brain. To complete a task - like recalling a memory - usually more than one region of the brain is involved, and they are connected by neural networks which is like the brain's wiring. It is believed that there are problems with the brain's wiring in schizophrenia. \n\nThe DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10 criteria are used to determine whether a person has schizophrenia. These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities (unusual occurrences) in the behavior of the person, followed by a clinical assessment. A person can be determined to have the disease only if the symptoms are severe. \n\n<span style= \" padding:0 2em; \"> Criteria for diagnosis </span> \n\nEuropean countries usually use ICD-10 criteria, while the United States and the rest of the world usually use the Diagnostic and Staticians Manual (DSM). \n\nThe DSM diagnostic criteria is divided into three categories: \n\nCharacteristic symptoms: Two or more of these symptoms must each be present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment): \n\n#Delusions \n\n#Hallucinations \n\n#Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of a formal thought disorder \n\n#Very disorganized behavior (such as dressing inappropriately or crying frequently) or catatonic behavior (or being in a daze) \n\n#Negative symptoms, such as a lack of or decline in emotional response, speech, or motivation \n\n#: If the delusions are bizarre, or if the person hears one imaginary voice making a running commentary of the person's actions or hears two or more voices talking with each other, then only that symptom (delusions or hallucinations) is required. The speech disorganization criterion is met only if it is severe enough to affect communication negatively and substantially. \n\nSocial or work problems: For a significant portion of the time since symptoms began, one or more major areas of functioning, such as work, relationships, or self-care, are markedly below the level that the person achieved before. \n\nSignificant duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment). \n\nSubtypes \n\nThe DSM-IV-TR contains five subtypes of schizophrenia, although the developers of the next version of the DSM, DSM-5, recommend that these subtypes be dropped: \n\nParanoid subtype: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present. However, thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or lack of emotional response are not present. Delusions involve imagining that someone wants to harm the person or are very complex. Other themes, such as envy, extreme religious beliefs, or physical complaints, might also be present (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0). \n\nDisorganized subtype: This subtype is named \u201chebephrenic schizophrenia\u201d in the ICD. Thought disorder and lack of emotional responsiveness are both present (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1). \n\nCatatonic subtype: The person might be almost immobile or might exhibit restless, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include acting as though one is in a daze. Or, one might passively allow others to pose one\u2019s limbs and then stay in that position (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2). \n\nUndifferentiated subtype: Serious mental symptoms are present, but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types are not met (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3). \n\nResidual subtype: Positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5). \n\nThe ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes: \n\nPost-schizophrenic depression: People might have some minor schizophrenic symptoms and have depression after one of the five subtypes. (ICD code F20.4). \n\nSimple schizophrenia: Strong negative symptoms increase slowly over time, with no history of episodes of serious mental illness (ICD code F20.6). \n\nThere are various medical conditions, other psychiatric conditions and drug abuse related reactions that may mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia (meaning they have some or all of the same symptoms). For example, delirium can cause visual hallucinations, or an unpredictable changing levels of consciousness. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a disorder in which a person becomes obsessed with certain ideas or actions. However, separating the obsessions of OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia can be difficult. \n\nThere is no clear evidence that treating schizophrenia with anti-psychotic drugs early is effective. The British NICE guidelines recommend cognitive behavioural talk therapy for all people at risk. In recent research, 76 patients at risk for schizophrenia were divided into two groups. One group got omega3 for 3 months and the other got a dummy pill (food oil). After 12 months only 4.9% of the omega 3 group had got schizophrenia compared to 27.5% in the other group. There is some evidence which shows that early treatment with drugs improves short term outcomes for people who have a serious episode of mental illness. These measures show little benefit five years later. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pre-onset phase with anti-psychotic drugs is of uncertain benefit and so is not recommended (as of 2009). Prevention is difficult because there is no reliable way to find out in advance who will get schizophrenia. \n\nThe treatment of schizophrenia is based upon the phase of the illness the person is in. There are three treatment phases: \n\nAcute Phase \n\nThe goals of treatment during the acute phase of treatment, defined by an acute psychotic episode, are to prevent harm, control disturbed behavior, reduce the severity of psychosis and associated symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression, negative symptoms, affective symptoms), determine and address the factors that led to the occurrence of the acute episode, effect a rapid return to the best level of functioning, develop an alliance with the patient and family, formulate short- and long-term treatment plans, and connect the patient with appropriate aftercare in the community \n\nStabilization Phase \n\nDuring the stabilization phase, the goals of treatment are to reduce stress on the patient and provide support to minimize the likelihood of relapse, enhance the patient\u2019s adaptation to life in the community, facilitate continued reduction in symptoms and consolidation of remission, and promote the process of recovery. If the patient has improved with a particular medication regimen, continuing to use of that regimen and monitoring are recommended for at least 6 months. \n\nStable Phase \n\nThe goals of treatment during the stable phase are to ensure that symptom remission or control is sustained, that the patient is maintaining or improving his or her level of functioning and quality of life, that increases in symptoms or relapses are effectively treated, and that monitoring for adverse treatment effects continues. Regular monitoring for adverse effects is recommended. For most persons with schizophrenia in the stable phase, psychosocial interventions are recommended as a useful adjunctive treatment to pharmacological treatment and may improve outcomes. \n\nAntipsychotic medications substantially reduce the risk of relapse in the stable phase of illness and are strongly recommended. \n\nThe first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can reduce the positive symptoms in about seven to fourteen days. However, medication fails to improve negative symptoms or problems in thinking significantly. Many antipsychotics are Dopamine antagonists (a substance interfering with how another substance works.) High concentrations of Dopamine are thought to be the cause of hallucinations and delusions. For this reason blocking Dopamine reception helps against hallucinations and delusions. \n\nThe British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) suggest checking for reactions to traumatic experiences, deciding together with a doctor about using medication, taking into account the side effect risks of getting diabetes, becoming seriously overweight, getting brain damage (tardive dyskinesia, 5% risk per year), men growing breasts, and feelings described as inner torture (akathesia). The guidelines warn against using more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time. \n\nSome reviews of research sponsored by the makers of antipsychotic drugs claim that about 40 to 50 percent of people have a good response to medication, 30 to 40 percent have a partial response, and 20 percent have an unsatisfactory response (after 6 weeks on two or three different drugs). Other research from The British Journal of Psychiatry were more negative and claimed that \" the clinical relevance of antipsychotics is in fact limited \" . This study included 22 428 patients and 11 antipsychotic drugs. \n\nA drug called clozapine is an effective treatment for people who respond poorly to other drugs, but clozapine can lower the white blood cell count in 1 to 4 percent of people who take it. This is a serious side effect. \n\nFor people who are unwilling or unable to take drugs regularly, injectable long-acting preparations of antipsychotics can be used. When used in combination with mental and social interventions (treatment), such preparations can help people to continue their treatment. \n\nNumerous mental and social interventions can be useful in treating schizophrenia. Such interventions include various types of therapy, community-based treatments, supported employment, skills training, token economic interventions, and mental interventions for drug or alcohol use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, might reduce a return of symptoms or the need for hospitalizations (having to go into hospital.) There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (also known as \u201ctalk therapy\u201d) . \n\nThe British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) recommend for both people are at risk of getting schizophrenia and people who have got it, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy. Getting support from people who have become well from schizophrenia is also strongly recommended. \n\nIn a family oriented treatment program in Finland, Open Dialog, 8 out of 10 people with schizophrenia get well with no medication or very limited drug use, often only anxiety medication. \n\nSchizophrenia has great human and economic costs. The condition results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 to 15 years, primarily because of its association with being overweight, not exercising, and smoking cigarettes. An increased rate of suicide (a person killing themself) plays a lesser role. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s. \n\nSchizophrenia is a major cause of disability, with active psychosis ranked as the third-most-disabling condition. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have an ongoing disability with symptoms that keep coming back. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently, with community support. In people with a first episode of serious mental symptoms, 42 percent have a good long-term outcome, 35 percent have an intermediate outcome and 27 percent have a poor outcome. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing world than in the developed world, although that conclusion has been questioned. \n\nThe suicide rate of people who have schizophrenia is estimated to be about 4.9 percent, most often occurring in the period following the first appearance of symptoms or the first hospital admission. 20 to 40 percent try to kill themselves at least once. \n\nSchizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals who have schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent of these people being regular smokers, compared to 20 percent of the general population. Those individuals who smoke tend to smoke heavily and to smoke cigarettes with a high nicotine content. \n\nResearch continues on schizophrenia. In the spring of 2013, genetics associations were shown between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia per recent study. In the summer of 2013, for the first time, brain tissue development was replicated in three dimensions by scientists cloning a human \" mini-brain \" using stem cells. This could help with schizophrenia and autism neurological research (research related to the brain.) \n\nAs of 2011, schizophrenia affects around 0.3% to 0.7% of people, or 24 million people worldwide, at some point in their lives. More men are affected than women: the number of males with the disorder is 1.4 times greater than that of females. Schizophrenia usually appears earlier in men. For males the symptoms usually start from 20 to 28 years of age, and in females it is 26 to 32 years of age. Symptoms that start in childhood, middle or old age are much rarer. Despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide, its rate of likelihood varies across the world, within countries, and at the local level. The disorder causes approximately 1% of worldwide disability adjusted life years (in other words, years spent with a disability). The rate of schizophrenia varies depending on how it is defined. \n\nAccounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome are rare before the 19th century. Detailed case reports from 1797 and 1809, are regarded as the earliest cases of the disorder. Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults by B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel in 1853, termed d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce (literally 'early dementia'). The term dementia praecox was used in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder. In 1893 Emil Kraepelin introduced a new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was primarily a disease of the brain, and a form of dementia, different from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which usually happen later in life. \n\nEugen Bleuler coined the term \u201dschizophrenia\u201d, which translates roughly as \" split mind \" , in 1908. The word was intended to describe the separation of functioning between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia because some of his patients improved rather than got worse. \n\nIn the early 1970s, the criteria for determining schizophrenia were the subject of numerous controversies. Schizophrenia was diagnosed far more often in the United States than in Europe. This difference was partly the result of looser criteria for determining whether someone had the condition in the United States, where the DSM-II manual was used. In Europe, the ICD-9 manual was used. A 1972 study, published in the journal Science, concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States was often unreliable. These factors resulted in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980 with a stricter and more defined criteria for the diagnosis. \n\nNegative social judgment has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of people who have schizophrenia. \n\nIn 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from \u201cSeishin-Bunretsu-By\u014d\u201d\u3000\u7cbe\u795e\u5206\u88c2\u75c5 (\u201cmind-split-disease\u201d) to \u201cT\u014dg\u014d-shitch\u014d-sh\u014d\u201d\u3000\u7d71\u5408\u5931\u8abf\u75c7 (\u201cintegration disorder\u201d), in an attempt to reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment. The idea that the disease is caused by multiple factors (not just one mental cause) inspired the new name. The change increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 percent to 70 percent over three years. \n\nIn the United States in 2002, the cost of schizophrenia, including direct costs (people who were not hospitalized, people who were hospitalized, medicines, and long-term care) and non-healthcare costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment), was estimated to be $62.7 billion. \n\nThe book \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d and the film of the same name are about the life of John Forbes Nash, an American mathematician and Nobel Prize winner who has schizophrenia. The movie \u201cThe Soloist\u201d is based on the life of Nathaniel Ayers, a gifted musician who dropped out of the Julliard School, in New York City after the symptoms of schizophrenia began. He later became homeless in Los Angeles, California, in the notorious Skid Row section. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:36:16Z", "text_length": 36642}
{"title": "Rickets", "parsed_text": "Rickets is a disease that happens in young children. It happens in children who do not get enough vitamin D and calcium. It causes larger spaces inside bones, and makes them dry, like sponges. It can make the legs curve toward each other (so the knees touch) or away from each other. \n\nRickets in adults is called osteomalacia. \n\nThe word \" rickets \" comes from the Greek word rhakhis, which means \" spine. \" \n\nPeople need both vitamin D and calcium to make their bones strong. \n\nVitamin D helps the bones absorb (take up) calcium. Low vitamin D makes it hard to absorb calcium. \n\nThe human body makes vitamin D <sub> 3 </sub> in the skin, from cholesterol. Then the liver changes vitamin D <sub> 3 </sub> into calcitriol, which sends calcium from the blood into the bones. The bones need calcium to stay strong. However, the skin will not make vitamin D <sub> 3 </sub> unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it. Sunlight contains ultraviolet light, so getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D <sub> 3 </sub> . \n\nPeople need calcium for calcification. Calcification uses calcium to help make bones bigger and stronger. Low calcium makes bones delicate and easier to break. \n\nRickets can be prevented if a person gets plenty of calcium and vitamin D. \n\nThe best way to do this is to get a lot of sunlight, and eat foods that have a lot of vitamin D and calcium in them. However, people who cannot get enough vitamin D and calcium this way can take supplements (vitamin pills that have calcium and vitamin D in them). \n\nFoods that have a lot of calcium in them include: \n\nMilk and other dairy products like cheeses \n\nSome green vegetables, like broccoli, spinach, and kale \n\nToday, many products are \" fortified \" with vitamin D: the vitamin was added when the food was made. These foods include some kinds of orange juice, breakfast cereals, breads, and even bottled water. The food's label will say how much calcium it has in it. \n\nCalcium is absorbed best by the bones when it is taken in amounts of 500 600 grams or less. Because of this, doctors suggest eating smaller amounts of foods with calcium in them, at different times in the day, instead of all at once. \n\nThere are three ways to get vitamin D: sunlight, foods, or supplements (vitamin pills that have vitamin D in them). However, many people cannot get enough vitamin D just from their diet. \n\nThere only a few foods that have a lot of vitamin D in them. They include: \n\n\" Fatty fish \" that were caught in the wild, like mackerel, salmon, and tuna \n\nCooked egg yolk \n\nVitamin D is added to some foods, like some kinds of dairy products, cereals, and orange juices \n\nBreast milk may not have enough vitamin D in it to prevent rickets. Babies who are only breastfed, and not fed any other foods, may be given vitamin D drops to make sure they do not get rickets. However, this is not a significant risk if mothers and child have some exposure to sunlight. Children with dark skin are more likely to need additional vitamin D. \n\nThese things make a person more likely to get rickets: \n\nThey are between three and 36 months old. Children this age are at the greatest risk for rickets because their bones are growing so quickly, and are supposed to get bigger and stronger during this time \n\nThey were born prematurely (earlier than normal) \n\nThey live in the Northern parts of the world, where there is less sunshine \n\nThey spend too little time outside \n\nThey always wear sunscreen when going out \n\nEven mild sunscreen decreases the amount of vitamin D the body makes by 95% (by stopping the body from taking in vitamin D from sunlight) \n\nHowever, people should still wear sunscreen when they might get sunburned \n\nThey do not eat enough food that has calcium or vitamin D in it, because of lactose intolerance or a strict vegetarian diet \n\nThey cannot make or use vitamin D because of a medical disorder, like coeliac disease, or because they take certain anti-seizure medications \n\nSigns and symptoms of rickets include: \n\nBrittle (easily broken) bones or teeth \n\nBleeding more than normal \n\nStunted growth (not growing like a healthy child would) \n\nSweating \n\nWeakness (feeling tired all the time) \n\nBody pain \n\nVitamin D \n\nCalcium \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-22T14:43:14Z", "text_length": 4982}
{"title": "Acne", "parsed_text": "Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands. The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris, which means \" common acne \" . The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection. \n\nOils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles. Under the blocked pore, oil builds up. Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly. This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible. \n\nThe face, chest, back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen. \n\nAcne is common during puberty, when a person is turning from a child into an adult, because of high levels of hormones. Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood. \n\nThere are lots of acne treatment methods available, including natural treatments. \n\nPeople of all ages can get acne, although it occurs more commonly in adolescents. Acne can affect people physically, psychologically, and socially. \n\nAcne causes scarring, and acne pustules can be very painful and sensitive. \n\nPeople suffering from a bad case of acne, especially adolescents, can develop low self-esteem which can lead to depression. \n\nLow self-esteem issues can make a person suffering from acne withdraw from many social events. It makes developing new personal relationships (especially love relationships) more difficult. Low self-esteem can also cause problems with career advancement as the person may find it difficult to present a positive attitude. This may sometimes even lead to suicide. \n\nExactly why some people get acne and some do not is not completely known. These can cause acne, or make it worse: \n\nHormonal fluctuation \n\nHyperactive sebaceous glands \n\nStress \n\nMany dead skin cells staying on the skin \n\nBacteria in the pores \n\nDiet \n\nAspirin reduces inflammation which in result, reduces facial redness due to acne. \n\nMany things are sold to treat acne, the most popular being benzoyl peroxide. Many of these things have not been scientifically proven to help acne. However, a mix of commercial and homemade treatments can help with acne for various reasons. \n\nKilling the bacteria that grow in the blocked follicles. This can be done by ingesting antibiotic medication, or by putting antibiotics on the skin. Antibiotics act quickly and are a powerful way of temporarily getting rid of acne. When the body develops a resistance to the antibiotics, the bacteria returns stronger than before. \n\nRemoving oil on the skin can be done by taking drugs that contain Vitamin A. Accutane is the name of the most famous treatment using massive quantities of Vitamin A. \n\nRemoving dead skin cells can be done by treatment with salicylic acid. This encourages the skin to peel away the top layer of cells. \n\nDiet: studies have shown that acne is quite rare in areas with different diets, and particular food items have been shown to exacerbate acne. \n\nPopping a pimple should not be done by anyone but a qualified dermatologist. Pimple popping irritates skin, can make the bacteria spread, and can cause scars. If you must pop a pimple yourself, it is advised to apply warm water to the area before popping it and to wash your hand thoroughly before beginning so as to avoid spreading bacteria via the hands. Applying hot water will open up the pores and reduce the damage because it will require less force to pop it. \n\nThere are 650 million people in the world with acne, which is around 9.4% of the global population. More females are getting acne than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). Acne affects 40 to 50 million people in the United States (16%) and approximately 3 to 5 million in Australia (23%). Acne affects people of all ethnic groups. \n\nBad acne often leads to bad scars where the skin has the shape of a volcano. It is difficult and expensive to treat acne scars. \n\nThese are some ways acne scars can be treated: \n\nDermabrasion. The top layer of the skin is taken away to make the scar look less deep. It makes the scar less visible, but does not remove it completely. Many treatments may be needed. \n\nLaser resurfacing. A laser is used to burn off the top layer of the skin. \n\nDeep penetrating light therapy. A non-laser, non-ultraviolet light therapy that can be used to improve mild to moderate acne. A blue light causes the breakdown of certain chemicals within the acne bacteria, destroying the cell walls. \n\nPunch excision. The scar is raised with a punch tool and the edges are smoothed together. \n\nChemical peels. Different types of acid are put on the skin so that a smoother layer can form. \n\nSubcision. A hole is made between the scar and the skin under the scar. Blood can pool under the scar, and raise it to the surface of the skin. \n\nQuestions and Answers About Acne, from the U.S. National Institutes of Health \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-29T21:58:28Z", "text_length": 5298}
{"title": "Tuberculosis", "parsed_text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. In the past, people called it consumption. \n\nTB is caused by several types of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. \n\nThe bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people cough, sneeze, or spit. \n\nOf every 100 people with TB, between five and ten people show symptoms. In these people, the disease is called active. Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment. \n\nDiagnosis of active TB relies on radiology. Doctors often look at an X-ray of the chest. In addition, they check body fluids. These fluids have microbes in them, which are grown in cell cultures. The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB. \n\nIf the patient has TB, but does not show symptoms, the disease is 'latent'. Doctors use a skin test, called the Mantoux test, to detect latent TB. They often do blood tests too. \n\nThere is a vaccine against some forms of tuberculosis. It is called bacillus Calmette & ndash;Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. \n\nTB used to be easily treated and cured with antibiotics. However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics. This resistance makes treatment difficult. Many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time. There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to all drugs. \n\nTuberculosis can have many symptoms. The most common include: \n\nA cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis) \n\nChest pain \n\nNot having any appetite \n\nWeakness \n\nWeight loss \n\nChills \n\nVery pale skin \n\nListless eyes \n\nFever \n\nSweating a lot at night \n\nDifficulty breathing \n\nFeeling very tired \n\nPeople are also more likely to get tuberculosis if they live close to other people who have TB. For example, TB can spread easily in homeless shelters, prisons, and immigrant communities. \n\nExperts believe that one third of the world population is infected with M. tuberculosis. New infections occur at a rate of one per second. In 2007, about 13.7 million chronic cases were active globally. In 2010, about 8.8 million new cases developed and nearly 1.5 million people died from the disease, most of them in developing countries. The number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002. \n\nTuberculosis does not happen at the same rate around the world. About eighty percent of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive for TB, but only five to ten percent of people in the United States do. \n\nPeople usually get tuberculosis because of a weakened immune system. Many people with HIV and AIDS can also get tuberculosis. \n\nFrequently asked Questions about TB at CDC.gov \n\nExplainTB: Multilingual audiovisual information on tuberculosis", "timestamp": "2018-05-06T19:16:52Z", "text_length": 3532}
{"title": "Cancer", "parsed_text": "Cancer is a type of disease where cells grow out of control, divide and invade other tissues. In a person without cancer, cell division is under control. In most tissues, healthy cells divide in a controlled way and copy themselves to create new healthy cells. With cancer, this normal process of cell division goes out of control. Cells change their nature because mutations have occurred in their genes. All the daughter cells of cancer cells are also cancerous. \n\nIf the abnormal cells do not invade, but just divide and swell up their original tissue, this is not called \" cancer \" . It is called a tumour. Tumours are usually not a threat to life because they can be cut out. However, some tumours occur in places where they cannot be cut out, and they can be fatal. Some brain tumours are of this type. \n\nThe symptoms of cancer are caused by the cancerous cells invading other tissues. This is called metastasis. Metastasis is a process in which cancer cells move through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. When this happens, a person's cancer can be spread throughout his or her body. Eventually those other tissues cannot work as well, and the whole body begins to get worse, and may die. \n\nCancer can affect anybody at any age. Most types of cancer are more likely to affect people as they get older. This is because as a person's DNA gets older, their DNA may become damaged, or damage that happened in the past may get worse. One type of cancer that is more common in young men, rather than older people, is testicular cancer (cancer of the testicles). \n\nCancer is one of the biggest and most researched causes of death in developed countries. \n\nCancer is one of the most common causes of death around the world. It causes about 12.5% (or one out of every eight) of all deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. \n\nDifferent types of cancer have different causes. Some things are known to cause cancer in a specific body part; other things are known to be able to cause many different types of cancer. For example, using tobacco (smoked or smokeless) can cause many types of cancers, such as lung, mouth, tongue, and throat cancers. Other things that are known to be able to cause cancer - or make a person more likely to get cancer - include: radiation including sunlight and X-rays in large or many doses, and exposure to radiation (for example in a nuclear power plant); chemicals and materials used in building and manufacturing (for example, asbestos and benzene); high-fat or low-fiber diets; air and water pollution; eating very little fruits and vegetables; obesity; not enough physical activity; drinking too much alcohol; and certain chemicals commonly used at home. Some cancers can also be caused by viruses. Many people who are exposed to these things do get cancer - but some do not. \n\nThere are many different kinds of cancers. Some of the most common are: \n\nBreast cancer \n\nBrain cancer \n\nLeukemia (a blood cancer) \n\nTesticular cancer \n\nMesothelioma (which starts in the lungs, and is usually caused by breathing in asbestos for long periods of time) \n\nLung cancer \n\nThere is no sure cure for cancer. It can only be cured if all of the cancerous cells are cut out or killed in place. This means that the earlier the cancer is treated, the better the chances are for a cure (because the cancer cells may not have had enough time to copy themselves and spread so much that the person cannot be cured). \n\nThere are a few different types of treatments that are used to try to kill cancer cells. These treatments are: \n\nRadiotherapy (radiation therapy), which uses radiation to kill cancer cells \n\nChemotherapy, which uses strong medications to kill cancer cells \n\nImmunotherapy works by \" inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response \" . \n\nSurgery to take out part or all of a tumor \n\nAfter surgery, many patients may need radiotherapy or chemotherapy to keep the tumor from growing again \n\nThere are a few reasons why treating cancer is complicated. For example: \n\nMost things that kill cancer cells also kill normal, healthy cells. This can cause many side effects, like hair loss and vomiting. \n\nThe body's immune system usually will not attack cancer cells, even though they could easily kill the body. This is because the cancer has actually become a part of the body by invading cells and tissues. So the immune system sees the cancer as part of the body it is trying to protect, not as a threat to be attacked. \n\nThere are many different types of cancer, and each has its own symptoms and causes. Even with the same type of cancer, different people may have different symptoms, and may react to treatments differently; their cancer also may grow or spread at different speeds. Treatment has to be a good fit to both the type of cancer and the individual patient who has the cancer. \n\nMany, many people in many countries study cancer and work on finding treatments. There has been some good progress in finding treatments, and many cancers are treated with success. Along with looking for different medical treatments to treat cancer, some studies also look for things that people with cancer can do themselves to try to make themselves healthier. For example, one study showed that if a person with lymphedema (a swelling of the arm linked to breast cancer) lifts weights, he may be able to fight his cancer better than somebody who does not lift weights. \n\nCancer has been around for many thousands of years. Today, a lot of the medical terms used to describe cancer come from ancient Greek and Latin. For example, the Latinized Greek word carcinoma is used to describe a malignant tumor - a tumor made up of cancer cells. The Greeks also used the word \" karkinos \" , which would be translated by Aulus Cornelius Celsus into the Latin word cancer. The prefix 'carcino' is still used in medical words like carcinoma and carcinogenic. A famous Greek doctor, Galen, helped create another word that is very important to medicine today by using the word \" onkos \" to describe all tumours. This is where the word oncology, the branch of medicine that deals with cancer, comes from. \n\nHippocrates (a very famous ancient doctor who is often called the father of modern medicine) named many kinds of cancer. He called benign tumours (tumors that are not made up of cancer cells) oncos. In Greek, onkos means 'swelling'. He called malignant tumours karkinos. This means crab or crayfish in Greek. He used this term because he thought that if a solid malignant tumor was cut into, its veins looked like a crab: \" the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives (gets) its name \" . \n\n</ref> Hippocrates later added -oma (Greek for 'swelling') after the word 'carcinos'. This is how the word carcinoma came about. \n\nBecause the ancient Greeks did not believe in opening up dead bodies to study them, Hippocrates was only able to describe and make drawings of tumors he saw from the outside of the body. He drew tumors that had been on the skin, nose, and breasts. \n\nHippocrates and other doctors at that time treated people based on the humor theory. This theory said that there were four types of fluid in the body (black, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). Doctors tried to figure out whether these four \" humors \" (or body fluids) were in balance. They would then use treatments like blood-letting (cutting the patient and letting him bleed so that he would lose blood); laxatives (giving the patient foods or herbs to make him go to the bathroom), and/or changing the patient's diet. The doctors thought that these treatments would work to get the patient's four humors back into the right balance. The humor theory treatment was popular until the 19th century (the 1800s), when cells were discovered. By this time, people had realized that cancer can happen anywhere in the body. \n\nThe oldest known document that talks about cancer was discovered in Egypt and is thought to be from about 1600 B.C. The document talks about using surgery to treat eight cases of ulcers of the breast. These were treated by cauterization - by burning them - using a tool called \" the fire drill \" . The document also says about cancer, \" There is no treatment \" . \n\n</ref> \n\nAnother very early type of surgery used to treat cancer was written about in the 1020s. In The Canon of Medicine, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) said that treatment should involve cutting out all diseased tissue. This included the use of amputation (removing a part of the body completely) or removing veins that ran in the direction of the tumor. Avicenna also suggested that the area that had been treated should be cauterized (or burned) if needed. \n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries (the 1500s and 1600s), doctors started to be allowed to dissect bodies (or cut them open after death) in order to figure out the cause of death. Around this time, there were many different ideas about what caused cancer. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a clot of milk in the part of a woman's breast that produces milk. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius believed that all disease was caused by chemical processes. He thought that cancer, in particular, was caused by acidic lymph. Nicolaes Tulp, who lived at the same time as Sylvius, believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and was contagious. \n\nA British surgeon named Percivall Pott was the first person to figure out one of the real causes of cancer. In 1775, he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps (people who cleaned out chimneys). Other doctors started studying this topic and coming up with other ideas about what causes cancer. Doctors then started working together and coming up with better ideas. \n\nIn the 18th century (the 1700s), many people started to use the microscope, and this made a big difference in helping doctors and scientists understand more about cancer. Using the microscope, scientists were able to see that the 'cancer poison' spread from one tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ( \" metastasis \" ). This was first made clear by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan, between 1871 and 1874. \n\nBefore the 19th century (the 1800s), using surgery to treat cancer usually had bad results. Doctors did not understand how important hygiene (or keeping things clean) is for preventing disease, especially after surgery. Because things were not kept clean during or after surgery, patients often got infections and died. For example, one well-known Scottish surgeon, Alexander Monro, kept records and found that 58 patients out of every 60 who had surgery for breast tumors died within the next two years. \n\nIn the 19th century, surgical hygiene got better because of asepsis. Doctors realized that dirtiness and germs cause infections, so they started to keep things cleaner and do things to kill germs in order to prevent their patients from getting infections. It became more common for people to survive after having surgery. Surgical removal of the tumor (taking the tumor out of the body by doing surgery) became the first-choice treatment for cancer. For this kind of treatment to work, the surgeon doing the operation had to be very good at removing tumors. (This meant that even if people had the same kind of cancer, they could get very different results, with some getting good treatment that worked and others getting treatment that did not work, because of differences in how good different surgeons were.) \n\nIn the late 1800s, doctors and scientists started to realize that the body is made up of many kinds of tissues, which in turn are made up of millions of cells. The discovery started the age of cellular pathology (studying cells to learn about diseases and figure out what is wrong with the body). \n\nIn the 1890s, French scientists discovered radioactive decay. Radiation therapy became the first cancer treatment that worked and did not involve surgery. It required a new multi-disciplinary approach to cancer treatment (people doing different jobs were working together to treat patients). The surgeon was no longer working by himself - he worked together with hospital radiologists (people who gave and read X-rays) to help patients. This team approach meant changes in how they worked. The different people on the team had to communicate with each other and work together, which they were not used to doing. It also meant that treatment had to be done in a hospital rather than at the patient's home. Because of this, patients' information had to be put together into files kept at the hospital (called \" medical records \" ). Because this information was now being kept and written down, scientists were able to do the first statistical patient studies using numbers to study questions like how many people who have a certain type of cancer or get a certain treatment survive. \n\nAnother important step forward in understanding cancer happened in 1926, when Janet Lane-Claypon published a paper on cancer epidemiology. (Epidemiology is a field of study which looks at how common a disease is, what patterns the disease takes in different kinds of people, and what this means for understanding and treating the disease.) This historic paper was a comparative study, which tries to find out what causes a disease by looking at a group of people who have the disease and figuring out how they are different from another group that does not have the disease. Lane-Clayton's study looked at 1000 people who all had the same background and lifestyle (or way of living): 500 people with breast cancer and 500 control patients (people without breast cancer). These people were the same in many ways, but some got breast cancer and some did not. To figure out what might be causing certain people to get breast cancer, the study looked at what was different about these people when they were compared to (or looked at alongside) the people who did not get cancer. \n\nLane-Clayton's study was published by the British Ministry of Health. Her work on cancer epidemiology was continued by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill. They used the same ways of studying cancer as Lane-Clayton, but they looked at a different kind of cancer: lung cancer. In 1956, they published their results in a paper called \" Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors \" (also called the British doctors study). Later, Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center (MRC), and started the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. By using computers, this unit was able to do something new and very important: it brought together large amounts of cancer data (pieces of information about cancer). This way of studying cancer is very important to cancer epidemiology today, and it has also been very important in shaping what we now know about cancer and what the rules and laws about the disease and public health are today. Over the past 50 years, many different people have done a lot of work to collect data from different doctors, hospitals, areas, states, and even countries. This data is used to study whether different kinds of cancer are more or less common in different areas, environments (for example, in big cities compared to the countryside), or cultures. This helps people who study cancer to figure out what makes people more or less likely to get different kinds of cancer. \n\nBefore World War II, doctors and hospitals were getting better at collecting (or getting and keeping) data about their patients who had cancer, but it was rare for this data to be shared with other doctors or hospitals. This changed after WWII, when medical research centers found out that different countries had very different number of cases of cancer. Because of this, many countries created national public health organizations (which studied public health issues in an entire country). These national public health organizations began to bring together health data from many different doctors and hospitals. This helped them figure out some of the reasons why cancer was so much more common in certain places. For example, in Japan, people studying cancer found out that people who had survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had bone marrow that was completely destroyed. This helped them realize that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation, which was a very important step in figuring out that leukemia (a blood cancer) can be treated with bone marrow transplants. \n\nSince World War II, scientists have kept finding better cancer treatments. However, there are some things that still need to get better. For example, while there are good treatments for many kinds of cancer, there are still no treatments for certain kinds of cancer, or for some cancers once they progress (or get worse) to a certain stage of the disease. Also, the cancer treatments that do exist are not all standardized (there is not one agreed-upon way of giving every treatment which is used each time the treatment is given). Cancer treatments are also not available everywhere in the world. People need to keep studying cancer epidemiology and forming international partnerships (where different countries work together) to find cures and make cancer treatments available everywhere. \n\nWhat is Cancer?

These can include: \n\nTiredness, \n\na swollen stomach caused by kwashiorkor, \n\nloss of weight, \n\nweakness and not being able to stand \n\nThe metabolism naturally lowers when a person is starved. This makes weight loss slower. \n\nConsistently not being able to eat enough will lead to permanent damage to the organs. This is the case for humans when they do not eat enough for about 1-2 months. A process called catabolysis will break down body tissues, using them as fuel to keep vital functions (the nervous system and the heart) working. It will first use muscles before it starts destroying fat. \n\nStarvation was also used to inflict a death penalty. People who eat nothing usually die in a few months. \n\nIn 1944 Ancel Keys started a scientific experiment about starvation. The participants were all men.

{"title": "Kwashiorkor", "parsed_text": "Kwashiorkor is a health condition of poor nutrition from not having enough protein in the diet. If a person uses up energy from carbohydrates (starches) and lipids (fats), their body may begin to use protein for energy. \n\nThe body breaks down protein into energy that can be used. They then do not have enough protein for other needed bodily functions such as growth and building tissues like bones. Usually this is a condition of children from aged 1 to 5 years, but rarely adults and older children get it. It is common in poor places in Africa. Symptoms include having a pot belly, swollen face, and hair that is dark then light then dark. This can be cured by having a protein- rich diet. \n\nKwashiorkor comes from a protein deficiency (lack) in the diet.

{"title": "Synesthesia", "parsed_text": "Synesthesia, or synaesthesia, is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses. People who have synesthesia are called synesthetes. \n\nSynesthesia is usually inherited (called congenital synesthesia), but exactly how people inherit it is unknown. \n\nSynesthesia is sometimes reported by people using psychedelic drugs, after a stroke, or during an epileptic seizure. It is also reported to be a result of blindness or deafness. Synesthesia that comes from events unrelated to genes is called adventitious synesthesia. This synesthesia results from some drugs or a stroke but not blindness or deafness. It involves sound being linked to vision or touch being linked to hearing. \n\nSynesthesia was investigated a lot in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but in the middle of the 20th century, it was less studied. Only recently has it been studied again in much detail. \n\nSome musicians and composers have a form of synesthesia that allows them to \" see \" music as colors or shapes. This is called chromethesia. Mozart is said to have had this form of synesthesia. He said that the key of D major had a warm \" orangey \" sound to it, while B-flat minor was blackish. A major was a rainbow of colors to him. This may explain why he wrote some of his music using different colors for different music notes, and why much of his music is in major keys. \n\nAnother composer who had color-hearing was the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. In 1907, he talked with another famous composer, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who had synesthesia, and they both found that some musical notes made them think of certain colors. Scriabin worked with a man named Alexander Mozer who made a color organ. \n\nThe same type of synesthesia may have different effects (pronounced and less pronounced) on different people. \n\nSynesthetes often say that they did not know their experiences were unusual until they found out that other people did not have them. Others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives. Most synesthetes consider their experiences a gift\u2014a \" hidden \" sense. Most synesthetes find out in their childhood that they have synethesia. Some learn to apply it in daily life and work. For example, they might use their gift to memorize names and telephone numbers or do mental arithmetic. Many people with synesthesia use their experiences to help them be more creative, for example, in making drawings and music. \n\nMore than 60 types of synesthesia have been reported, but only a small number have been studied by scientists. \n\nSome common types of synthesia include: \n\nGrapheme\u2013color synesthesia: Letters or numbers are seen to have colors of their own. \n\nOrdinal linguistic personification: Numbers, days of the week, and months of the year are felt to have their own personalities. \n\nSpatial-sequence: Numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week are located in specific places in space. For example, 1980 may be \" farther away \" than 1990. Or a year may be seen three-dimensionally as a map. \n\nVisual motion \u2192 sound synesthesia: Hearing sounds in response to seeing motion. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-22T16:55:50Z", "text_length": 4247}
{"title": "Autism", "parsed_text": "Autism is the name of a disorder affecting brain development. It is one of a group of disorders called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and childhood autism are kinds of autism spectrum disorders. \n\nASD is a condition that affects the way a person relates to their environment. The word spectrum is used because not all people with autism have the same traits and difficulties. Some people find interacting more difficult than others. Autism may be very apparent in someone or they may show no outward signs of it. The main areas of difficulty are in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests. In most cases of autism, motor communication {doing things} is affected. All these signs develop in the child's first two to three years of age. \n\nPeople who have autism find it difficult to act in a way that other people think is \" normal \" . They may find it difficult to talk to other people and to look at other people. Some people with autism do not like being touched. A person who has autism can seem to be turned inwards. They may talk only to themselves, rock themselves backwards and forwards, and laugh at their own thoughts. They might not like any type of change and may find it very difficult to learn a new behaviour like using a toilet or going to school. \n\nAutism is caused by the way that the brain develops, both before and after a baby is born. About one in every 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder. \n\nThe word \u201cautism\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201cautos\u201d, meaning \u201cself.\u201d The term describes conditions in which a person is removed from social interaction\u2014hence, an \u201cisolated self\u201d. The term \" autism \" was first used by a psychiatrist named Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe one group of symptoms of schizophrenia. Sigmund Freud considered this idea and thought it was related to narcissism. \n\nThree decades later, researchers in the United States began to use the term autism to describe children with emotional or social problems. Two researchers by the name of Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner were the pioneers of the research study for autism in the 1940s. \n\nIn 1943 Leo Kanner (a doctor from Johns Hopkins University) did a study of 11 children. The children were very intelligent. He found out that they had difficulties such as changing environments, being sensitive to certain stimuli, having speech problems and allergies to food. Later he named the children\u2019s condition \u201cearly infantile autism\u201d., now called autism. \n\nIn 1944 Hans Asperger studied separately a group of children and found very similar conditions. The children in Hans Asperger's group did not repeat words and they had no speech problems like Kanner's did. However, the children did have problems with fine motor skills such as holding a pencil. The children he studied seemed to be clumsier than other children. They also had \u201c[...] a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest and clumsy movements\u201d. Hans Asperger described a \" milder \" form of autism, his discovery is now called Asperger syndrome. \n\nIn 1943 and 1949, Kanner described the children he studied in scientific papers. In these papers, he wrote that he thought the children's parents were not loving them enough. He wrote that this might be part of the reason why the children had autism. For example, in 1949 he wrote that the children's parents showed no warmth, or love, to their children. He thought the parents were so \" cold \" that he compared them to refrigerators: <blockquote> \u201c[The children] were left neatly in refrigerators which did not defrost. Their withdrawal seems to be an act of turning away from such a situation to seek comfort in solitude\u201d. </blockquote> This idea became known as the refrigerator mother theory. For decades parents were blamed for causing their children's autism by not loving their children enough. \u00a0By now, we know this is not true. \n\nSchizophrenia and autism were linked in many researchers\u2019 studies. Only since the 1960s, medical professionals began to have a separate understanding of these two disorders. Since 1980, Kanner\u2019s so called early infantile autism is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Precisely because of the vague distinction between schizophrenia and autism, the DSM came out with a more accurate definition of autism in 1987. Henceforth, early infantile autism is called autism disorder. Furthermore, for the first time the DSM introduced standardised criteria to diagnose autism. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders expanded the definition of autism and included milder cases of autism. But especially the Asperger\u2019s syndrome was added in 1994. With the release of the fifth edition of the DSM in 2013 the subtypes of autism are summarized into the general term Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Individuals are now diagnosed on an autism spectrum with varying levels of intensity (mild, moderate and severe). \n\nmay like objects over faces as a baby \n\nmay not look at faces for more than a second \n\nmay prefer being alone, or not interested in making friends \n\nmay not react to signs of love e.g. hugging \n\ndifficulty in knowing how other people feel \n\nlaughing or crying at the wrong times \n\nmay not talk or communicate much \n\nmay speak \" robotically \" (i.e. with little change in tone or pitch) \n\ndifficulty with words that are spelt or sound the same but have different meanings \n\ntrouble with understanding gestures or facial expressions \n\nmay do the same action repeatedly (stimming) \n\nmay have limited interests (referred to as a special interest) \n\ndifficulty in coping with changes in routine \n\nGreater sensitivity \n\nAvoiding certain foods because they dislike the textures, or eating things that aren't food \n\nattraction to specific noises \n\ngood attention to detail \n\ngood balance skills (sometimes) \n\nDifferent studies resulted in different numbers of the frequency of autism spectrum disorders. One study stated ten cases of classical autism, 2.5 cases of Asperger's syndrome and 15 cases of mild autism (PDD-NOS) in 10,000 people - tendency: increasing. Other sources speak about 60 autism spectrum disorder cases in 10,000 people. However, the number of autism cases is not equal in men and in women. Here, the results of studies vary highly. Researchers in general say that 3-4 men are diagnosed for every woman that is diagnosed. This ratio decreases for severe cases to 1:1. It increases for high-functioning cases and in Asperger's syndrome reaches a ratio of 8:1. Recently, the awareness has increased that this ratio may be so high because studies are simply missing female autistic people. This could be because tests for autism typically focus on male autism traits. Another possible explanation is that autistic females may be better at adapting to social expectations and hiding their social problems. Studies have suggested that the brains of autistic females may rather be like neurotypical men\u2019s (non-autistic men) brains of the same age. These could be reasons why it is not so easy to realise whether a woman is autistic - and therefore, why more men than women are diagnosed. \n\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are seen or diagnosed more often in males than females. The ratio is near one female for every four males diagnosed. But there is evidence that females may be diagnosed later than males. Researchers have argued whether there may be a gender bias playing a role in girls and women being underdiagnosed or being diagnosed late. Although males may have autism spectrum conditions more often, females show different symptoms of autism than males. Autistic females also have different behaviors. \n\nOver the past years, individuals have been using the terms \" autism \" and \" autism spectrum disorder \" like they mean the same thing. Autism is a spectrum disorder. This means that some people who have autism are only mildly affected. These people may go to regular schools, go to work, and have partners and families. Some people are affected worse than others. These people may be able to take care of most of their own needs at home like dressing and getting food, but not be able to have a regular job or travel alone. A person who has severe autism may need to be cared for all their life. Few people with autism are extraordinarily gifted or talented. These people are said to have savant syndrome. They are often very good at just one thing in particular, like mathematics, playing the piano or remembering football scores. \n\nThe overall category of the Autism Spectrum Disorder is called Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The name describes medical conditions with developmental problems in a number of fields. In most cases, when referring to the Autism Spectrum Disorder, we are referring to the most common disorders: \n\nType of Autism \n\nChildhood Autism \n\nAtypical Autism \n\nAsperger\u2019s Syndrome \n\nICD-10 \n\nF84.0 \n\nF84.1 \n\nF84.5 \n\nAge of onset \n\nDelay or abnormal functioning in communication, language, play and cognitive development before the age of three \n\nAtypical Autism may differ from Childhood Autism in age of onset. Here, abnormal behaviour is only visible after the age of three. \n\nAdditionally, only one or two of the three categories (social interaction, communication and behaviour) are affected \n\nNo noticeable delay of communication, language, play or cognitive development during childhood \n\nInteraction \n\nIs affected \n\nIs affected \n\nCommunication \n\nIs affected \n\nNo delay in language \n\nBehaviour \n\nIs affected \n\nIs affected \n\nThe different categories, the so-called \u201cInternational Classification of Diseases\u201d (ICD), are defined by the World Health Organization. As shown in the table, the diseases vary in several points. These are the age of onset, social interaction, communication and behaviour. An individual belongs to a certain category, depending on the areas of impairment. All three may seem similar in symptoms, yet are not the same. Still, people within one group show similar symptoms. The groups can be used to search for an underlying cause of the disease and to provide a better treatment. \n\nScientists do not know exactly what causes autism. There may be many different causes for the different types of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Scientists do know about some things that make a person more likely to have an Autism Spectrum Disorder. \n\nThe autism spectrum disorders are highly heritable disorders. This means that it is very likely (over 90%) that the child of an autistic person will also be on the autism spectrum. The reason for this are certain genes. These genes are linked to autism and are passed on from a parent to the child. Already Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger noticed that fathers of autistic children often preferred being on their own over being with people. Therefore, Kanner and Asperger suspected a genetic cause. Studies with families with a child on the autism spectrum were done to investigate this theory. They found that sometimes the children\u2019s parents (fathers as well as mothers) also show social difficulties, shyness and problems with understanding contextual information when talking to someone. Some studies have found this in only 10 out of 100 families, some in as much as 45 out of every 100 families. \n\nOther than the studies done on children who had autistic parents, recently a couple of studies were done on children who either had a sibling or a twin showing autistic signs. Similar to the outcomes in the autistic parents studies, most children having autistic siblings/ twins were found out to be showing autistic signs. According to a recent study, around fifty percent of infants with autistic siblings showed some kind of atypical behaviour, around one forth of them showed delays and deficits in achieving infancy milestones and around 17% of all were later diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). \n\nMoreover, twin studies showed that it is much more likely that identical twins are both on the autism spectrum than that non-identical twins are both on the autism spectrum. Identical twins have nearly the same DNA. Therefore, it is highly probable that they are either both autistic or both not autistic. Non-identical twins share only half of their genes which makes it less likely that they both have the disorder. Scientists have shown that the recurrence risk (the likelihood that a child is on the autism spectrum if it has a sister or a brother that is autistic as well) is 20 to 80 times higher than the probability for having the disorder in the average population. \n\nHowever, it is not a single gene that increases the risk for autism spectrum disorders. Several genes have been linked to the disorder. All of the identified genes can in sum only explain one or two out of every ten autism cases. None of the genes that have been found to play a role in autism can explain more than one out of every 100 cases. \n\nThe genetic influences include: \n\nmutations, \n\ngenetic syndromes (e.g. Fragile X syndrome), \n\nde novo (newly occurring in a family) as well as inherited copy number variations (CNV) - a CNV is the duplication or deletion of a gene - and \n\nsingle nucleotide variants (SNV) - an SNV is a change in one nucleotide that occurs with very low frequency. \n\nThe affected genes influence: \n\nthe interaction between brain cells and synaptic functioning, \n\nneuronal growth and neuronal migration (the wandering of a neuron from its birthplace to its final location in the brain) and \n\ninhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. \n\nResearchers have not found a single neuronal correlate for autism spectrum disorders, i.e. no abnormal functioning of the brain is the only cause of autism. Nevertheless, scientists found some differences between the brains of autistic people and the typical human brain. These differences lie in the anatomy of the brain, the activity in certain brain regions as well as in the connections between brain regions. It is a general tendency that autistic people use the same brain regions as other people but show different activity. In some areas the activity is less, in others it is stronger. However, this may only be true for male autists. Throughout the last years, studies have shown that brains of autistic women might be like normal men's brains. \n\nSome researchers grouped autistic people's difficulties into three main areas in order to investigate their neuronal basis. \n\nResearchers say that building a Theory of mind is one of the main problems for autistic people. This makes it difficult for them to interact with others. Problems in social interaction are probably worsened by low preference for social stimuli, such as faces. This tendency has been found in studies tracking the person\u2019s eye movements and in EEG studies. EEG studies showed lower than normal activity in the fusiform face area (FFA), a brain region that is usually active when seeing faces. However, the results of other studies could not show this. \n\nAlso, scientists measured brain activity of people on the autism spectrum with fMRI while they were thinking about their own emotions. They found activity in the same brain regions as in non-autistic people. The difference was that some regions which are important for thinking about oneself and emotions (especially the anterior insula) were less active in autistic people. Other brain regions were much more active. These findings may explain the difficulties people with autism experience when trying to understand complex facial expressions and emotions (such as shame, jealousy). \n\nPeople on the autism spectrum show a lower ability for executive function. Executive function means physical, emotional and cognitive self-control. This includes planning actions, focusing, shifting attention and flexibility of behaviour and thinking. Autistic people's ability can improve but it will remain below non-autistic people's ability in executive function. \n\nProblems with executive function are probably caused by large networks in the brain. Grey matter and white matter irregularities have a negative influence on the way different brain regions work together (functional integration). A smaller corpus callosum leads to abnormalities in working memory (an active process of keeping a memory until it is needed) and planning actions. \n\nCentral coherence is the ability to build wholes out of parts. It is weak in people with autism. This means that autistic people focus more on details. They cannot build wholes out of them. Not being able to pay attention to wholes results in difficulties with perception and language. Therefore, people with autism usually need more time for dealing with information coming from their surroundings. As a consequence, they typically also need more time for responding. However, performance varies between people on the autism spectrum. Moreover, the term central coherence may include many interacting aspects. This makes it difficult to find the cause for it in the brain. Neural correlates for central coherence are not yet known. \n\nThe risk for autism spectrum disorders can be increased if the mother uses thalidomide, valproic acid or drinks too much alcohol during pregnancy. The risk for autism also increases with the age of father and mother at the time of pregnancy. \n\nScientists know that parents do not cause their children's autism by not being loving enough. \n\nScientists do know for sure that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines do not even make a person more likely to have autism - even if they are already at a high risk for autism before they get their vaccines. \n\nIn 1997 A. Wakefield and others found autism signs one month after the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was applied. They released a paper in which they claimed that autism is caused by the MMR vaccine. However, the study had several flaws: \n\nthey did not exclude children of whom a genetic cause was known, \n\nthey did not assess the children's abilities before the vaccine was given, \n\nneuropsychological and endoscopic assessments were not blind, \n\nthey did not have control subjects. \n\nAlso, no plausible biological mechanism could explain how the MMR vaccine leads to autism. Since then many case-control studies have been done to investigate the relationship between vaccines and autism. This means, they compared a group which was vaccinated with a group that was not vaccinated but apart from that identical. They did not find MMR vaccines to be the cause of autism. Neither did they find an increased risk for autism by the vaccination. \n\nParents also worried that thiomersal (US: thimerosal - a substance that makes vaccines and other medicines usable for a longer time) might cause autism because it contains mercury. No harm from the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines was known. Yet, vaccines for infants containing mercury were taken from the market. Nevertheless, thiomersal as a cause for autism is biologically also not biologically. Mercury poisoning triggers clearly different symptoms than autism. Still, researchers did studies about this topic. They did not find a connection between thiomersal and autism. \n\nFinally, a third theory was suggested. It was stated that many vaccines at the same time would weaken the immune system of infants. However, autism is not a disorder that is related to the immune system. Furthermore, single and also many vaccines do not weaken the immune system. \n\nDiagnosing autism is difficult since there is no medical test like a blood test. Instead, an evaluation is made by a team of doctors and other health professionals who are experienced in autism and know the individual. \n\nA reliable diagnosis can first be given at the age of two. At the age of 18 and 24 months, children should get a check-up. If anything wrong is noticed, a further evaluation is done. In this, a team of professionals will interview the child\u2019s guardians about the child\u2019s behaviour and see what they are like in different settings. This may also include behavioural or physical assessments as well as intelligence tests or developmental tests. A good, detailed, history of the child is often very useful in receiving a diagnosis. \n\nAdults can be diagnosed in adults as well as children. This can be difficult because autism has symptoms that can overlap with other disorders, such as OCD, that may have appeared by adulthood. An expert will usually ask the adult about concerns, challenges in life (such as socially or behaviourally) as well as standardised testing in these areas. They also often ask for a developmental history. \n\nIn 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). In order to be diagnosed with autism, a person must fulfill two standardized criteria. It is important that individuals must show symptoms from early childhood, even if those symptoms are recognized later. These symptoms have to limit everyday functioning. Additionally, these symptoms cannot be explained by an intellectual disability or a developmental delay. \n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviours. \n\nAutism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of symptoms, skills and levels of disability. Some autistic people also have learning disabilities, mental health issues or other conditions. This means that autism can also co-occur with other conditions and symptoms of the following disorders: \n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder \n\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder \n\nLearning Disability \n\nIntellectual Developmental Disorder \n\nAnxiety Disorder \n\nIntellectual Disability \n\nIn the DSM-V, a diagnosis of autism excludes making a formal diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, other mental health conditions may be undiagnosed in an autistic person, because it is impossible to make a comorbid clinical diagnosis. \n\nSince autism is a spectrum, every person with autism is different. Different treatments help different people. There are a few different categories of treatment. The main ones are medication, different therapies and diets. The treatment is fitted depending on what a person with autism needs. \n\nIt is still unclear what causes autism. There may be a few causes. At the moment, it is only possible to lower the symptoms of autism. A full recovery from autism is not possible. If therapies cannot reduce the symptoms of autism, medications are used additionally. Often, several medications are used at the same time to treat different symptoms of autism. \n\nSerotonin is a chemical messenger that transports signals between cells and is very important for normal function, such as with sensory perception, memory, learning and sleep, all of which are impaired in autistic people. \n\nResearchers have not yet found a link between autism and serotonin, although they have been successful in treating autism with SSRIs, which stop cells from absorbing serotonin, meaning more is used for signals. \n\nThey can be used to treat repetitive behaviour, aggression, hyperactive behaviour and outbursts of anger. The SSRIs can have many side-effects. Usually the medication is better tolerated by adults than by children. Examples of SSRIs are Clomipramine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Venlafaxine, Trazodone and Mirtazapine. \n\nDopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain. It helps to do movements, release hormones and strengthen cognitive abilities. Researchers found that increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain will worsen the symptoms of autism. Substances that help to reduce symptoms of autism are the antipsychotic drugs. There are two types of antipsychotic medications. One of the types are typical antipsychotics. They block the sites where dopamine would bind to a cell. Atypical antipsychotic drugs on the other hand block the sites where dopamine or serotonin would bind to a cell. Antipsychotic medicine is the most successful treatment for excitability in autism. It can also help to reduce aggression, self-injury, hyperactivity and repetitive, although it may have many side-effects. Originally, antipsychotic medications were used to treat mental disorders like depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Examples of antipsychotic drugs are Haloperidol, Clozapine, Risperidone and Paliperidone. \n\nIn the beginning, psychostimulants were only used for patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Researchers found out that they can also help patients with autism. The medication can reduce hyperactivity and inattention in people with autism. The medication can have many side-effects. Examples are Methylphenidate, Clonidine and Guanfacine. \n\nPeople with autism often have problems with their digestive organs like the stomach or gut. These problems could be inflammations, abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea or bacterial overgrowth. The reasons may be malnutrition, food intolerances or allergies. Specific food products causing these problems are excluded from the diet. In many cases, products containing gluten or casein, the main protein occurring in dairy products, are excluded. In many cases vitamins, minerals as well as essential fatty acids are additionally provided. A big problem is that many autistic people cannot tell that they have pain. Therefore, many problems concerning the digestive organs stay undetected. \n\nTherapy can be used to minimize distress caused by sensory overload. Individual therapy plans are created. The therapist tries to help the autistic person in many different aspects. \n\nOne part of this is sensory integration. The therapist will help the patient to make sense of different sensory inputs. For example, they may ask a child patient to play with finger paints or collect objects from a bad of dried beans. \n\nAnother part is the training of daily life activities. The therapist may help the patient to get used to things like getting dressed, eating, hygiene, shopping and financial management. These may be done one step at a time if the activity involves multiple steps, such as cooking. \n\nPlay therapy is also helpful, especially for children. It can be useful to learn about certain emotions, which can be hard for autistic people. This can also be used to help learn social conventions, such as shaking hands instead of hugging when meeting a stranger. \n\nOften animals are used to help autistic people. Most often dogs or horses are used. The people diagnosed with autism can care for these animals, pet them and, in the case of the horse, even ride on them. Studies showed that the interaction between an autistic person and animals can increase communication, reduce stress, fear, aggression and reduce the severity of the symptoms of autism. \n\nMusic therapy consists of two parts: One is an active listening part. Here, the therapist is making music himself or playing music from a record. In the other part, the autistic person can make music himself like playing an instrument or singing. Music therapy will improve different aspects of communication. \n\nHere, different materials and techniques are used to draw pictures. The aim of art therapy is to make the autistic person more flexible and relaxed and to improve communication skills, self-image and learning skills. The effects of the therapy can be long lasting and transferred to the school, work or home setting. \n\nNonverbal learning disorder (common in people with autism spectrum disorders) \n\nAsperger Syndrome (a form of autism spectrum disorder) \n\nWhat is Autism? from AutismSpeaks.org \n\nNational Autistic Society http://www.autism.org.uk \n\nListening Ears www.listeningears.in \n\nScientific studies \n\nFive Very Different and Major Psych Disorders Have Shared Genetics - from Science World Report (February 28, 2013) (shows genetic links between autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia) \n\n5 Disorders Share Genetic Risk Factors, Study Finds - from The New York Times (February 28, 2013) \n\nPsychiatric Disorders Linked Genetically - from the Wall Street Journal (February 27, 2013) \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-14T21:41:27Z", "text_length": 38911}
{"title": "Alzheimer's disease", "parsed_text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a brain disease that slowly destroys brain cells. As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile dementia accounting for up to 70% of cases. \n\nThe clinical symptoms of AD usually occurs after age 65, but changes in the brain which do not cause symptoms and are caused by Alzheimer's, may begin years or in some cases decades before. Although the symptoms of AD begin in older people it is not a normal part of aging. \n\nAt this time there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that can help some patients with the signs and symptoms so they do not affect them as badly. There are also treatments which slow down the disease so the damage to the brain does not happen as quickly. There are also certain personal habits that people can learn which may help to delay the onset of the disease. \n\nWhile it is not yet known exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease, there are a number of risk factors which may make a person more likely to get it. Some of these risk factors are genetic; changes to four different genes have been found which increase the risk. \n\nThe current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old person to get Alzheimer's disease is estimated to be at 10.5%. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States causing about 83,500 deaths a year. In 2007, there were more than 26.6 million people throughout the world who were affected by AD. \n\nAlzheimer's disease was named after Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist who first described the disease after studying the case of a middle-aged woman, Auguste Deter, who was a patient at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1906. The disease was named Alzheimer's disease in 1910 by Dr. Emil Kraepilin a co-worker of Alzheimer. \n\nTwo of the main features found in the brains of people with of Alzheimer's disease, are neurobrillary tangles ('tangles' for short), which are made up of a protein called tau, and senile plaques (which are made mostly from another protein called beta-amyloid, they are also sometimes called beta-amyloid bundles or 'bundles' for short). The tau proteins that form the tangles previously held together a structure inside the neurons called a microtubule which is an important part of the neuron; it forms part of the cytoskeleton (cell skeleton) which is what maintains a cell's shape, and microtubules plays a part in cell communication. Roger M. Nitsch. Neurodegenerative Diseases: Neurobiology, Pathogenesis and Therapeutics. Eds. by M. Flint Beal, Anthony E. Lang, Albert C. Ludolph Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (2005) \n\npp.452-453. </ref> \n\nBoth tangles and plaques may be caused by other diseases, such as Herpes simplex virus Type 1 which is being investigated as a possible cause or contributor in developing Alzheimer's. It is not known for sure if tangles and plaques are part of what causes Alzheimer's, or if they are the results. \n\nMicrotubules \n\nMicrotubules are made of a protein called tubulin. The tubulin is polymerized, which is when molecules form the same shapes over and over again that are linked together in groups, and these groups are linked together. They can form long chains or other shapes; in this case the polymerized tubulin forms microtubules. The microtubules are rigid tubes like microscopic straws which are hollow inside. Microtubules help keep the shape of the neuron, and are inolved in passing signals through the neuron. \n\nTau \n\nTau is a protein that is found mostly in the neurons of the central nervous system. They help hold together the microtubules within the neurons. and when changes happen in the way the tau proteins are supposed to work the microtubules break apart. The tau proteins which are no longer holding the microtubules together form strands called fibrils, which then clump together inside the neuron to make what are called neurofibrillary tangles . These clumps, also known as 'tau tangles', are all that remain after a neuron has died. \n\n<table border= \" 1 \" bordercolor= \" #FFFC00 \" style= \" background-color:#FFFFEE \" width= \" 50% \" cellpadding= \" 4 \" cellspacing= \" 0 \"> \n\n<caption> Braak Staging of Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary changes. <br> <small> This is currently used only for research purposes </small> </caption> \n\n<th> Stage </th> \n\n<th> Neurofibrillary tangles in: </th> \n\n<th> Symptoms </th> \n\n\t <tr> \n\n\t\t <td> <center> I/II <br> Transentorhinal stage </center> </td> \n\n\t\t <td> Transentorhinal region and entorhinal region </td> \n\n\t\t <td> No symptoms </td> \n\n\t </tr> \n\n\t <tr> \n\n\t\t <td> <center> III/IV <br> Limbic stage <br> </td> \n\n\t\t <td> Hippocampal formation and parts of the limbic system and the amygdala </td> \n\n\t\t <td> Beginning Alzheimer's disease <br> Cognitive impairments: memory problems, spatial cognition </td> \n\n\t </tr> \n\n\t <tr> \n\n\t\t <td> <center> V/VI <br> Isocortical stage </center> </td> \n\n\t\t <td> Throughout the cerebral cortex </td> \n\n\t\t <td> Dementia: fully developed Alzheimer's disease </td> \n\n\t </tr> \n\n</table> \n\nBeta-amyloid \n\nBeta-amyloid(A\u03b2) (also called 'amyloid beta') plaques start with a protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is one of the proteins that make up a cell's membrane or outer covering, that protects the cell. In this case a neuron.. As it is made inside the cell, APP sticks out through the membrane of the cell. \n\nIn different parts of the of cell including the outermost part of the cell membrane, chemicals called enzymes snip the APP into small pieces. These enzymes that do the snipping are alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase. Depending on which enzyme is doing the snipping and what parts of the APP are snipped, two different things can happen. One that is helpful and one that causes the formation of beta-amyloid plaques. \n\nThe plaques are formed when beta-secretase snips the APP molecule at one end of the beta-amyloid peptide, releasing sAPP\u03b2 from the cell. Gamma-secretase then cuts the pieces of APP that is left and, still sticking out of the neuron\u2019s membrane, at the other end of the beta-amyloid peptide. After this snipping the beta-amyloid peptide is released into the space outside the neuron and begins to stick to other beta-amyloid peptides. These pieces stick together to form oligomers. Different oligomers of various sizes are now floating around in the spaces between the neurons, which may be responsible for reacting with receptors on neighboring cells and synapses, affecting their ability to function. \n\nSome of these oligomers are cleared from the brain. Those that are not cleared out clump together with more pieces of beta-amyloid. As more pieces clump togther the oligomers get bigger larger, and the next size up are called protofibrils and the next size after that are called fibrils. After a while, these fibrils clump together with other protein molecules, neurons and non-nerve cells floating around in the space between the cells and form what are called plaques. \n\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) \n\nDeposits of beta-amyloid also form in the walls (in the tunica media, the middle layer, and tunica adventitia or tunica externa, the outer layer) of small and mid-sized arteries (and sometimes veins) in the cerebral cortex and the leptomeninges (the leptomeninges are the two inner layers - pia mater and arachnoid - of the meninges, a protective 3-layer membrane covering the brain.) \n\nCAA is found in 30% of people over the age of 60 years who do not have any dementia but is found in 90%-96% of people with Alzheimer disease and is severe in one third to two thirds of these cases. \n\nThe first area of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer's is the \" transentorhinal region \" which is part of the medial temporal lobe located deep within the brain. Neurons start dying in this area first. It then spreads into the adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC) which acts as a central hub, for a widespread network that handles signals for memory and movement (like a main train station with train tracks going to different areas). \n\nThe EC is the main area for communication between the hippocampus, and the neocortex - which is the outer portion of the brain responsible for higher functioning such as how the brain perceives information from the five senses; (smell, sight, taste, touch and hearing; Ex. seeing a person's face and recognizing them,) generating motor commands (Ex, moving and arm or leg, walking, running) spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language. \n\nThe disease then spreads into the hippocampus which is part of the limbic system. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is involved in forming new memories, organizing them, and storing them for later recall. It is also where emotions and senses, such as smell and sound are attached to specific memories. Example 1.: A memory might make you happy or sad. Example 2.: A smell might bring up a certain memory. \n\nThe hippocampus then sends memories to the different parts of the cerebral hemisphere where they are placed in long-term storage and it helps retrieve them when necessary. Example: An adult trying to remember the name of a classmate from kindergarten. \n\nIn addition to handling memory the hippocampus is also involved in emotional responses, navigation (getting around) and spatial orientation (knowing your sense of place as you move around Example: Knowing your way around your bedroom even with the lights off). \n\nThere are actually two parts of the hippocampus which is shaped like a horseshoe with one in the left part of the brain and the other in the right part of the brain. \n\nPreclinical \n\n<div style= \" background:#DDF;border:1px solid #666;float:right;width:20%;padding:1em;margin:0 0 1em 1em; \"> \n\n<span style= \" color:red \"> Red </span> <span style= \" color:blue \"> Blue </span> <span style= \" color:green \"> Green </span> <span style= \" color:purple \"> Purple </span> <span style= \" color:orange \"> Orange </span> <br/> <span style= \" color:purple \"> Purple </span> <span style= \" color:orange \"> Orange </span> <span style= \" color:green \"> Green </span> <span style= \" color:blue \"> Blue </span> <span style= \" color:red \"> Red </span> \n\n---- \n\n<span style= \" color:red \"> Blue </span> <span style= \" color:green \"> Orange </span> <span style= \" color:blue \"> Purple </span> <span style= \" color:orange \"> Green </span> <span style= \" color:purple \"> Red </span> <br/> <span style= \" color:orange \"> Purple </span> <span style= \" color:blue \"> Green </span> <span style= \" color:green \"> Red </span> <span style= \" color:red \"> Blue </span> <span style= \" color:purple \"> Orange </span> \n\n---- \n\n<div align= \" center \"> The Stroop Color\u2013Word Test </div> \n\nThis is a short example of the test. The test is used to measure different cognitive functions such as selective attention. \n\nNaming the colors of the first set of words is easier and quicker than the second, because in the first set, the colors match the words, in the second set they do not. So a person has to pay more attention. \n\nPeople having problems with attention as may happen in early-stage Alzheimer's tend to do poorly on this test. G Binetti, E Magni, A Padovani et al. Executive dysfunction in early Alzheimer's disease. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 1996 January; 60(1): 91\u201393. \n\nPMCID PMC486198 </ref> </div> \n\nWith current research using advances in neuroimaging such as FDG-PET and PIB-PET scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, it is now possible to detect the beginning processes of Alzheimer's disease that occur before symptoms begin. The research suggests that clinically normal older people (no symptoms at all) have biomarker evidence of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) build-up in the brain. This amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is linked to changes in the structure of the brain and how it works that is the similar to what is seen in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - which may lead to Alzheimer's - and people with Alzheimer's. \n\nThese small preclinical changes (no symptoms) in the brain may occur many years, to even a few decades before a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. With a stage where there is some memory loss, or mild cognitive impairment. These changes put a person at risk of developing the clinical symptoms of full-blown Alzheimer's but not everyone who has these changes will get the disease. Even though there is no cure for Alzheimer's, there are new treatments which are being developed which would work better in the very first stages of the disease. \n\nAt this time exactly what makes up the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's is still being researched, such as why some people with go on to develop Alzheimer's and others do not. So the term preclinical phase is being used for research only. There is a worldwide effort in various countries doing research in this area known as the World Wide Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) which is the umbrella organization for neuroimaging studies being carried out through the North American ADNI, European ADNI (E-ADNI), Japan ADNI, Australian ADNI (AIBL), Taiwan ADNI, Korea ADNI, China ADNI and Argentina ADNI. \n\nBeginning stages \n\n\" Misdiagnosis in very early stages of Alzheimer's is a significant problem, as there are more than 100 conditions that can mimic the disease. In people with mild memory complaints, our accuracy is barely better than chance, \" according to study researcher P. Murali Doraiswamy, MBBS, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke Medicine, \" Given that the definitive gold standard for diagnosing Alzheimer's is autopsy, we need a better way to look into the brain. \" \n\nIn 1901, a 51-year-old woman named Auguste Deter, was committed to the City Asylum for the Insane and Epileptic, (St\u00e4dtischen Anstalt f\u00fcr Irre und Epileptische) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany which had the nickname \" Irrenschloss \" (Castle of the Insane). She was married and had a normal life until eight months prior to her commitment, when she started having psychological and neurological problems, such as problems with memory and language, paranoia, becoming disorientated and having hallucinations. \n\nShe was studied by a doctor on staff named Alois Alzheimer (1864\u20131915). Alzheimer became interested in her case because of her age; while the effects of senile dementia were known at the time, they usually did not start until a person was in their early to mid-sixties. Her case was also notable because of the rapid onset of dementia, only eight months, from the first reported symptoms, until she was committed. \n\nWhile conducting one of his examinations of Ms. Deter, he asked her to perform a series of simple writing tasks. Unable to do what was asked such as write her name, she said \" I have lost myself, so to speak \" ( \" Ich habe mich sozusagen selbst verloren \" ). \n\nAlzheimer left the hospital in Franfkurt in 1902 to begin working with Emil Kraepelin at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Heidelberg-Bergheim, and in 1903 both he and Kraepelin began working at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. \n\nWhen Ms. Deter died of septicemia on 8 April 1906, Alzheimer was informed and her brain was sent to Munich for him to study. Studying samples of her brain under a microscope he noticed neurofibriallry tangles and bundles made up of beta-amyloid plaque, which are two of the main features of the disease. On 3 November 1906, Alzheimer presented the results of his findings in Auguste's case at the Conference of South-West German Psychiatrists in T\u00fcbingen, and he published his findings in the case in 1907. \n\nIn 1910, Emil Kraepelin named the disease 'Alzheimer's disease'. Alzheimer's disease usually beigins affecting people between ages 60\u201365, in Ms. Deter's case - who was 55-years-old when she died - she had a form of what is now known as Early-onset Alzhiemer's disease. \n\nAnyone can get Alzheimer's disease, rich people or poor famous people and unfamous people. Some of the famous people who have gotten Alzheimer's disease are former United States President Ronald Reagan and Irish writer Iris Murdoch, both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities got worse with the disease. \n\nOther cases include the retired footballer Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, \n\n</ref> the former Prime Ministers Harold Wilson (United Kingdom) and Adolfo Su\u00e1rez (Spain), the actress Rita Hayworth, the Nobel Prize-winner Raymond Davis, Jr., the actors Charlton Heston and Gene Wilder, \n\n</ref> the novelist Terry Pratchett, politician and activist Sargent Shriver, the Blues musician B.B. King, director Jacques Rivette, Indian politician George Fernandes, \n\nand the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics recipient Charles K. Kao. In 2012, Nobel Prize writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez was diagnosed with the disease. Former Finnish President Mauno Koivisto died of the disease in May 2017. Country singer Glen Campbell died of the disease in August 2017. \n\nvideo \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-02-03T14:29:26Z", "text_length": 20144}

When people have silicosis, the changes in their body often are cyanosis (when skin goes a blueish color), a fever, when the body gets hotter or being not able to breathe properly. Sometimes doctors do not realize that someone has silicosis, and think that they have other illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis or fluid in the lungs. \n\nIt was first noticed in 1705 by Bernardino Ramazzini (an Italian doctor).

{"title": "Color blindness", "parsed_text": "People with color blindness cannot tell the difference between certain colors. They may not see colors at all. \n\nMost color blindness is heritable, usually as simple Mendelian inheritance. Sometimes, it is the result of damage to the eyes, nerves, or the brain. It can be caused by coming into contact with certain chemicals. \n\nMost color blindness is permanent. Some conditions can lead to temporary color blindness. During certain kinds of migraine, some people are unable to tell the difference between certain colors. There is no treatment cure for permanent color blindness. \n\nMany more males are color blind than females. Between five and eight percent of males, but less than one percent of females, are color blind. \n\nColor blindness is usually thought of as a disability. However, people who are color blind have one advantage: they are sometimes better at seeing through some types of camouflage. \n\nIn 1798, English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific article about color blindness. That was after he found out that he was color blind. The article was called \" Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours \" . Because of this, the condition is sometimes called daltonism. As of 2009, the word daltonism is used only for the type of color blindness called deuteranopia. \n\nThere are three steps in the process of telling the difference between colors: \n\n#Light hits specialized nerve cells in the eye. Those cells are called receptors. Some of them are stimulated and create an electrical signal. \n\n#The signals move along nerves to special parts of the brain. \n\n#Those parts of the brain interpret the signals. The signals are changed into an image. This image is then carefully looked at to separate different objects, to see shapes and sometimes colors, and to link these to other kinds of information. \n\nInside the human eye is a part called the retina. The retina receives the images that the eye sees. It sends the images to the brain. The retina has two types of cells: Rod cells and Cone cells. They work in different types of light. \n\nRod cells receive the images that the eye sees when the light is dim, at night, or in a dark room. \n\nCone cells receive the images that the eye sees in normal daylight or in bright light. There are three types of cone cells. Each type has a different chemical photopsin and reacts to a different spectrum of light. One is specially sensitive to short wavelengths. Another is sensitive to medium wavelengths. The third is sensitive to long wavelengths. These wavelengths cover much of the visible light. Each color is \" seen \" as a result of how much each of the receptors is stimulated. \n\nParts of the thalamus and the visual cortex in the brain are involved in seeing, also seeing colors. Color blindness can therefore also result if these areas of the brain, the optic nerve or the retina have been damaged. These types of color blindness usually happen because of an accident. They are not inherited. Inherited forms of color blindness affect the retina only. \n\nThat way it is possible that only a part of the visual field is affected by color blindness, but in the rest, there is no color blindness. \n\nSome types of color blindness, but not inherited color blindness, can be cured. \n\nThere are several different problems that can cause color blindness. \n\nIf a person's eye has no cone cells, then they cannot see any color at all. They can only see shades of dark and light. \n\nThere are three types of cone cells in the human eye. If there are two types, a person will have a hard time to tell certain colors apart. If there is only one type, a person will not see color at all. \n\nSometimes cone cells change. This means that they no longer react to those wavelengths they should. A person will need more of a certain color to see this color. They see colors differently, and may not be able to tell certain colors apart. Most of these people do not know they are color blind, as they have little difficulty telling colors apart in most cases. \n\nThere may be nothing wrong with the eye, but the nerves that transport the information or the area in the brain that interprets it may be damaged. This means that the signal is interpreted the wrong way. The damage may be permanent, or it may be temporary. Certain conditions of the brain, like a migraine can change the way people see colors. \n\nThis condition is very rare. People who suffer from it can only see in black, gray and white: They can perceive only differences in brightness and do not see color. This is called monochromacy. \n\nThere are two main types of total color blindness: \n\nRod monochromacy (achromatopsia): The retina has no cone cells. This makes it difficult to see even lights of a normal level; this means that people who suffer from it, are almost blind. It occurs almost only on the island of Pingelap, a part of the Pohnpei state in the Federated States of Micronesia. There it is called maskun: about one person in 12 of the population has it. The island was hit by a storm in the 18th century. Very few men survived the storm. One of them carried a gene for rod monochromacy. Today, several hundred people live on the island, about 30% have this gene. \n\nCone monochromacy: The retina has both rods and cones, but only one type kind of cone. People who suffer from this will be able to see patterns well, in normal daylight, but they will not see hues. \n\nThere are two kinds of red-green color blindness: protanopia or deuteranopia. Deuteranopia is the most common form of color blindness; between five and ten percent of males suffer from it. It is called Daltonism because John Dalton discovered it. Those affected have trouble telling the difference between red and green. As seen by protanopes (people suffering from protanopia), red is darkened. Most often, this is because they lack the receptors for long (protanopia) or medium (deuteranopia)-length light waves or because these receptors have changed their sensitivity. \n\nAlthough the name is blue-yellow color blindness (tritanopia), people affected by this type of color blindness can usually tell the difference between blue and yellow. Instead they cannot tell the difference between blue and green, and also yellow and violet. It is different from the other types of color blindness because it is not linked to sex. It is equally possible for anyone to develop blue-yellow color blindness. It is caused by having few or no cones in the retina which can sense short wavelength light. \n\nSometimes, people do not have problems seeing color, but their brain has trouble \" telling \" the color, and interprets it wrong. It is also possible that only certain parts of the eye have color blindness; people may become color blind because of other diseases, but after the disease goes away, see normally again. This seems to be the case with certain forms of migraine. \n\nMales have one X and one Y chromosome; females have two X chromosomes. Many of the genes involved in making color vision work are on the X chromosome: they are sex linked. For this reason, men are more often affected by color blindness than women. \n\nThe \" color blind \" gene allows non-color blind people see the difference between red and green. The gene is located on the X chromosome. This means that a male will be color blind if the single X he inherits from his mother contains the color blind version of the \" color blind \" gene. A female will inherit color blindness only if she inherits two X chromosomes containing defective (mutant) color gene alleles. In other words, a female needs to inherit \" color blind \" genes from both parents in order to be color blind. \n\nThe Ishihara plate test has been in use since 1917. Each plate has an image with dots of different size and color. People will then see different images (most often Arabic numbers). Those with certain types of color blindness will see different numbers from those not affected by color blindness. \n\nBecause many young children have not learned numbers yet, other tests have been developed. They use symbols, like a square, a circle or a car instead of numbers. \n\nA color code is when there is much information in the color of certain item. Such codes cannot be understood easily by those who are color blind. For this reason, color should not be used alone to give information. Good graphic design avoids using color coding or color differences alone to give information. This does not only help color blind people, but also normally sighted people. \n\nCascading Style Sheets can be used on web pages. They allow to give a different color scheme for color blind people. Certain color scheme generators help graphic designers see color schemes as eight types of color blind people see them. \n\nColor blindness is very sensitive to changes in material. A red-green color blind person may be unable to see the difference between colors on a map printed on paper. The same map on a computer screen or television may appear normally. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to tell the difference between colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Thirdly, for some color blind people, color can only be if there is enough color: thin lines might appear black, but a thicker line of the same color can be seen in the correct color. \n\nIn certain cases when it is important to understand information very quickly, the visual system may drop the colors, and only work in shades of gray. This is important to know when designing the interfaces for objects that need to be used in an emergency situation, like emergency brakes, or emergency telephones. \n\nBecause color blind people may not see the difference between colors such as red and green, some countries, such as Romania have refused to give them driving licenses. In Romania, people have started to change the laws so that color blind people will also be able to drive legally. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, electricity wires in houses used to be red, black and green. They were changed to brown, blue and green/yellow to help color blind people see the difference between the \" live \" and \" earth \" wires. \n\nMany people do not understand color blindness. People who are color blind never swap the colors they are blind to. They may have trouble telling two colors from one another. That way they may have a problem finding the right kind of apple in the supermarket.

{"title": "Infection", "parsed_text": "Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents. The disease is caused by the invading agents multiplying. As they multiply, they produce toxins and damage host tissues. Infectious disease, also known as 'transmissible disease' or 'communicable disease', is illness resulting from an infection. \n\nTuberculosis - also called TB. \n\nBubonic plague \n\nPertussis - also called whooping cough \n\nleprosy \n\nAIDS/HIV \n\nHepatitis B \n\nPolio \n\nColds \n\nInfluenza - also called the flu. \n\nCOVID-19 \n\nThrush \n\nRingworm \n\nCryptococcosis \n\nCandidiadis \n\nAthlete's foot \n\nMalaria (carried by mosquitos) \n\nSchistosomiasis (flat worms) \n\nChagas disease \n\nPrions are proteins which act as infectious diseases. \n\nSome infections are caused by different infectious agents at different times. For example, some diarrhea is caused by bacteria. Some is caused by viruses. \n\nDiarrhea \n\nPneumonia \n\nMeningitis \n\nThis is a very short list. There are many more diseases from infection and other causes: common diseases. \n\nSome diseases can be passed from one person to another easily. Other infectious diseases are harder to get. If a person kisses or touches another person who is infected with the flu, a cold, measles, or a sore throat, he or she may get their disease. They may also give the person their disease if they cough on them. Other medical conditions such as AIDS, herpes, and hepatitis B, are only passed by closer contact. Having sex with an infected person, blood transfusions, or touching their blood or urine can sometimes pass on these conditions or diseases. \n\nPeople can stop disease by: \n\nCovering the mouth every time during coughing \n\nOnly drinking clean water \n\nOnly eating very cooked meat \n\nUsing a condom during sex \n\nBacteria are usually treated with antibiotic medicines like Tetracycline and Penicillin. Viruses will not be killed by antibiotics. They must be treated with special medicines called antivirals. Medicines to treat HIV/AIDS like zidovudine are antivirals. Antifungals like miconazole and fluconazole treat infections from fungus. Anti-parasitic medicines like Praziquantel and mebendazole. \n\nSome infectious diseases have no treatments that work well. For example, there is no medicine that works well to cure West Nile Virus and Rabies. So it is important to avoid getting these diseases. Some infectious disease goes away on its own. These mild diseases do not need to be treated. For example, colds are caused by viruses and they do not need medicines. \n\nSome diseases can be prevented by immunizations. Immunizations try to make a person have an immune reaction to an infectious agent. This is usually done before the person gets the disease. Examples of diseases prevented by immunizations are: polio, tetanus, and pertussis. In some cases, if all of the disease can be removed from society, we can get rid of the disease completely. An example of this is smallpox. This virus used to kill people, cause blindness, and bad scars. Now there has not been a person who had smallpox in over thirty years. \n\nSocial distancing \n\nVaccine \n\nZoonosis \n\nWorld Health Organization Report on Infectious Disease - 2002", "timestamp": "2020-05-13T22:15:58Z", "text_length": 3833}
{"title": "Suicide", "parsed_text": "Suicide is when a person chooses to kill themselves. When someone kills themselves, people say that they have \" committed suicide \" \" completed suicide \" or \" died by suicide\u201d, however using a variation of death by suicide is best practice. When a person thinks about killing themselves, the person is described as suicidal. \n\nWhen people start having thoughts about killing themselves, it is a medical emergency. They should get a suicide risk assessment as soon as possible. They should not be left alone. \n\nThere are many reasons why a person might think about suicide. Most people who are suicidal have some type of mental condition or illness. They may have a chronic condition, which means it has been going on for a long time. But it may be an acute condition , which means the first symptoms of mental illness happened rather quickly. \n\nDepression is the mental illness that most often causes a person to have suicidal thoughts. Depression may also be a symptom of other mental or medical disorders. \n\nDepression, which can lead to suicidal thoughts, has many possible causes. For example, it may also be caused by stress, and difficult events in a person's life, like losing a job or getting sick. Other causes of suicidal thoughts are bullying and inceldom. \n\nSuicide is one of the top three causes of death for young people aged 14\u201335 years-old. It is the second most common and the second leading cause of death for college students. Every 3 seconds, a person somewhere in the world tries to kill themselves. Every 40 seconds, someone dies by suicide. For every suicide, at least six other people are seriously affected.(WHO 2000) \n\nAlthough depression is the main factor in suicide, it is also treatable and suicide is often preventable. \n\nThere are many risk factors for suicide. However, it is important to remember that risk factors are not the same as causes. Risk factors do not cause suicide or suicidal thoughts. They only make it more likely that some people with those risk factors may become suicidal. If a person has a risk factor, that does not mean they are going to become suicidal. \n\nMost people who die by suicide have a mental disorder. Different studies found different rates, between 85%-95%. Depressive disorders account for about 80 percent of these numbers; schizophrenia, ten percent; and dementia and delirium about five percent. \n\nAmong people who have a mental disorder, 25% also have alcohol abuse issues. People who abuse alcohol have a 50% greater risk of suicide compared to those who do not. \n\nWhile acts of self-harm are not considered suicide attempts, a person who self-harms may be more likely to die by suicide. \n\nHopelessness: Feeling like there is no chance that things will get better. Hopelessness is very common in people who die by suicide. \n\nPerceived burdensomeness: When a person feels like they are a burden to others (like they just cause problems for other people). Suicidal people often feel hopeless at the same time. \n\nLoneliness: Feeling alone. Sometimes people actually are alone; sometimes they just feel lonely. People are more likely to feel suicidal if: \n\nThey do not have people to support them, such as family and friends \n\nThey feel like they do not belong or fit in with other people \n\nThey live alone \n\nSubstance abuse is the second most common reason for suicide and feeling suicidal. Only two serious mental illnesses - depression and bipolar disorder - cause more harm. A person is at greater risk for suicide whether they have been using drugs for a long time or just a short time. When a drug abuser is also sufffering from great sadness or grief, suicide is even more common. \n\nMore than half of suicides are at least partly due to alcohol or drug use. About one-fourth of people who die by suicide have a substance use disorder (sick with drug addiction or alcoholism). In teenagers and youth, the percent is even higher. \n\nProblem gamblers have more suicidal ideation and make more suicide attempts compared to the general population. (Problem gambling is gambling that causes major problems in a person's life.) \n\nIf a person becomes a problem gambler earlier in life, they have a higher risk of suicide for the rest of their life. Gambling-related suicide attempts are usually made by older people with gambling problems. Substance use and mental disorders increase the risk of suicide even more in people with problem gambling. \n\nThere is a link between suicidality and medical conditions, including chronic pain, mild brain injury, (MBI) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). People with these conditions had a higher rate of suicide that was not caused by depression or alcohol abuse. People with more than one medical condition had an even higher risk of suicide. \n\nProblems with sleeping, such as insomnia and sleep apnea, may be risk factors for depression and suicide. In some people, the sleep problem itself, not depression, may be what increases their risk for depression. \n\nPeople being treated for mood disorders should be checked by a doctor. This should include a physical examination and blood tests. This can make sure the person's mood disorder is not caused by a medical problem. Many medical conditions can cause problems with mood and thinking. Seeing a doctor will also help make sure that it is safe to prescribe medications for the person's mood disorder. \n\nSome mental disorders that are risk factors for suicide may be partly caused by problems in the brain and body. \n\nSerotonin is an important brain neurotransmitter (a chemical messenger). Some studies have found that people who tried to kill themselves had low levels of serotonin in their brains. People who died by suicide had the lowest levels. Low serotonin levels are a risk factor for suicide, even if a person has never had depression. \n\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): This is a protein that helps nerves grow. Problems with how BDNF works may help cause several mood disorders linked with suicidal behavior, including major depressive disorder. Studies of suicide victims have shown very low levels of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, even in people who had no mental illness. \n\nEven if they have the same risk factors, some people are at a higher risk for suicide than others. This is partly because of genetic inheritance. Genetics causes about 30\u201350% of the difference in suicide risk among different people. For example, a person whose parent died by suicide is much more likely to try to kill themselves. Epigenetics may also affect suicide risk. \n\nHow the media shows news stories of suicide may have a negative effect and trigger the possibility of copycat suicides (this is called the Werther effect). This risk is greater in teenagers and young adults. \n\nThe opposite of the Werther effect is the Papageno effect. This means that the media can help make suicide less likely if they cover good ways of dealing with stress and difficult things in life. \n\nA person is also more likely to die by suicide if: \n\nThey have an item they can use to kill themselves \n\nSomeone in their family has died by suicide \n\nThey have had a head injury \n\nThey do not have a job \n\nThey are poor or homeless \n\nThey have to deal with discrimination \n\nThey were physically or sexually abused as a child \n\nThey spent time in foster care \n\nThey are under stress from something, for example a school assignment or work. \n\nThey are afflicted with Gender dysphoria \n\nProtective factors make it less likely that a person will die by suicide. They help protect a person from the risk of suicide. They can also help protect a suicidal person from the effects of suicidal thinking. \n\nProtective factors can be internal, such as a person's personal strengths and beliefs. For example: \n\nHaving skills like good ways of dealing with stress and solving problems \n\nHaving religious or cultural beliefs that say life is important \n\nHaving reasons for living \n\nProtective factors can also be external, such as a person's relationships and life situation. These factors can include: \n\nHaving strong connections with family and friends, who are supportive \n\nNot being able to get items which are very deadly if used for a suicide attempt (like a gun) \n\nHaving someone who helps the person get the treatment and help they need \n\nBeing able to easily get good care and treatment for mental, physical, and substance abuse disorders \n\nProtective factors are as important to identify as risk factors. Just as risk factors can be reduced, protective factors can be increased. \n\nSuicide prevention tries to decrease the number of suicides by using protective measures. Some prevention strategies make it harder for people to get the most common things used to commit suicide. This includes taking away guns, poisons, and drugs. \n\nStudies have shown that good treatment of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse can decrease the number of suicides. So does follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt. \n\nIn many countries, people who are at high risk of hurting themselves can check themselves into a hospital emergency department. In some countries or states, a doctor, judge, or police officer can force a person to go to the hospital if they seem suicidal, even if the person does not want to go. The person will be watched closely at the hospital to make sure they do not hurt themselves. A doctor or mental health professional will decide whether the person needs to go to a psychiatric hospital. \n\n\" SOS Signs of Suicide \" is a suicide prevention program used in secondary schools for students between 13 and 17 years old. The program educations students about suicide, and tests them for suicide risk. Students who have done this program make less suicide attempts than students who have not done the program. \n\nSuicide hotlines and crisis intervention centers help students who are at high risk. They help people who have suicidal thoughts. \n\nA suicide risk assessment looks at how likely a person is to attempt suicide. A good assessment can help prevent a suicide. It is also the first step in coming up with a treatment plan. Even though suicide risk assessments are very important, they are usually not done. Many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment. \n\nWorldwide suicide rates have increased by 60% in the past 45 years, mainly in the developing countries. As of 2006: \n\nSuicide was the tenth leading cause of death in the world \n\nAbout a million people died of suicide every year (this means that 16 out of every 100,000 people in the world died from suicide every year) \n\nA person completed suicide every 40 seconds \n\nAccording to 2007 information, suicides happen twice as often as homicides in the United States. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the country, ahead of liver disease and Parkinson's disease. \n\nSuicide rates vary a great deal across the world. Lithuania has the highest suicide rate. \n\n30% of deaths by suicide are by people who are intoxicated.( <small> Source: SAMSHA) </small> \n\nThe most common ways of death by suicide are not the same in every country. In different areas, they include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. \n\nA 2008 report compared 56 countries, using information from the World Health Organization. It found that: \n\nHanging was the most common method in most of the countries. Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta, et al. . Bulletin of the World Health Organization 86 (9): 726\u2013732. September 2008. Accessed 2 August 2011. Archived 2 August 2011. See html version. \n\nThe data can be seen here. </ref> 53% of men who committed suicide, and 39% of women, used hanging. \n\nWorldwide, 30% of people who die by suicide use pesticides. This method was most common in the Pacific area, where over half of people who died by suicide used pesticides. It was least common in Europe, where only 4% used this method. \n\nIn the United States 52% of suicides involve the use of firearms. \n\nIn the United States, asphyxiation and poisoning are also common. About 40% of suicides in the United States used one of these methods. \n\nOther people in the world die by suicide by: \n\nBlunt force trauma (for example, from jumping off a building) \n\nCutting themselves and bleeding to death \n\nDrowning themselves \n\nSetting themselves on fire \n\nElectrocuting themselves \n\nStarving themselves \n\nSometimes, suicidal people do something that will make another person kill them. For example, a suicidal person might point a gun at a police officer, so the police officer will shoot the person in self-defense. This is commonly called \" suicide by cop. \" \n\nModern medicine treats suicide as a mental health issue. When a person starts having many thoughts about killing themselves, it is considered a medical emergency. \n\nThe Abrahamic religions (like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) think that life is sacred. They believe that when a person kills themselves, they are murdering what God has made. For this reason, many followers of Abrahamic religions thinks that when a person dies by suicide, they will go to Hell. \n\nThe Dharmic and Taoist religions (like Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto) believe that someone who does by suicide will be reincarnated in the next life with a less enlightened soul. However, many people of these religions are more likely to die by suicide because they believe that there will be a next life. They think that by dying by suicide, they may have a better chance in the next life. \n\nThere are several famous examples of suicide attacks in history. The Kamikazes were one example. They were Japanese fighter pilots during World War II, who would try to kill American soldiers by crashing their planes into American ships. By crashing their planes, they would kill themselves as well. \n\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were also done by suicide attackers. They flew planes into the World Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon. \n\nEuthanasia \n\nMass suicide \n\nSuicide pact \n\nCopycat suicide \n\nLive Through This (stories from people who survived being suicidal) \n\nLandmark Study Finds Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Predicts Suicide Attempt \n\nRating Scale Successfully Predicts Suicide Attempts \n\nLearn more about suicide and how to get help for yourself or others \n\nLearn from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline \n\nLearn from the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention \n\nHelp for military veterans \n\nHotlines \n\nUnited States: \n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: (800) 273-TALK (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or through online chat \n\nList of hotlines for LGBT adults and young people (from the It Gets Better Project) \n\nhttp://lostallhope.com Online help for suicidal people. \n\nCanada: \n\nFind a hotline near you (list from the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention) \n\nKids Help Phone: (800) 668-6868 (for kids and teenagers) \n\nOther countries: \n\nTo find a hotline in your country, use one of these lists from the International Association for Suicide Prevention or Befrienders Worldwide \n\nCrisis Text Line: Text 741741", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:31:05Z", "text_length": 21013}
{"title": "Transsexual", "parsed_text": "Transsexual people are people who change their sex. Some transsexual people go from male to female. Others go from female to male. They change how they look and act. They see doctors who can give them drugs and surgery. They change their name and sex through the law. \n\nPeople who go from male to female (MTF) are transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are transsexual men. \n\nTranssexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger. \n\nTranssexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones. \n\nSome transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed. \n\nVery rarely, some people (called detransitioners) who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born. \n\nSome of the effects of surgery and hormones can be reversed but others are permanent. \n\nGay and Lesbian Medical Association: Doctors who know about transsexual people. \n\nWorld Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH): Doctors, lawyers, and therapists who know about transsexual people. \n\nTom Waddell Clinic A clinic that helps transsexual people. \n\nHormones for transsexual people: This helps doctors learn how to give hormones to transsexual people. \n\n<cite id= \" fn_1 \"> Note 1: </cite> Lundstrom B, et al. \u201cOutcome of sex reassignment surgery.\u201d Acta Psychiat.

{"title": "Pregnancy", "parsed_text": "Pregnancy is when a female mammal has an unborn baby inside her. During pregnancy, a female is called \" pregnant \" . A human pregnancy is about 38 weeks long, from conception to childbirth. Usually the mother has one baby at a time. Sometimes the mother has two babies at one time. Two babies are called twins. The mother can have three or more babies at one time. This does not happen very often. \n\nPregnancy usually starts after a woman has sexual intercourse with a man. Her ovum (or egg) and his sperm (seed) come together and form a zygote (fertilized egg) inside her. \n\nSome people have trouble becoming pregnant. This is called infertility. Women and men with infertility may take drugs or have surgery to help a pregnancy start. Some people use treatments that are not natural, like in vitro fertilization, to become pregnant with the help of a doctor. \n\nWhen the woman's egg and the man's seed come together, it makes one cell called a zygote. The zygote grows into an embryo, which grows into a fetus. When the fetus is ready, the baby is born. \n\n<gallery class= \" center \"> \n\nImage:6 weeks pregnant.png|Embryo at 4 weeks after fertilization \n\nImage:10 weeks pregnant.png|Fetus at 8 weeks after fertilization \n\nImage:20 weeks pregnant.png|Fetus at 18 weeks after fertilization \n\nImage:40 weeks pregnant.png|Fetus at 38 weeks after fertilization \n\n</gallery> \n\n<gallery class= \" center \"> \n\nImage:Month 1.svg|Relative size in 1st month (simplified illustration) \n\nImage:Month 3.svg|Relative size in 3rd month (simplified illustration) \n\nImage:Month 5.svg|Relative size in 5th month (simplified illustration) \n\nImage:Month 9.svg|Relative size in 9th month (simplified illustration) \n\n</gallery> \n\nHuman pregnancy is divided into three parts called trimesters. A trimester is about three months long. During the first trimester, the woman might feel ill in her stomach. She might have to urinate often. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen starts to stick out. During the third trimester, her abdomen sticks out even more, and she becomes even heavier. \n\nAt the end of a full pregnancy, the woman's body pushes the baby out through her vagina. This is called delivering a baby or giving birth. Mothers can get help for birth from a midwife, nurse, or doctor. In some places, mothers give birth at home. In other places, mothers give birth in a hospital. Mothers who are ill or hurt may need to go to a hospital. \n\nGiving birth can hurt a lot at the end. In hospitals, a doctor or midwife can give drugs to the mother to reduce the pain. \n\nIf the baby cannot be pushed out, then a doctor can cut the mother open to take the baby out. This operation is called a Caesarean section. \n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that pregnant women must be given time away from work or equal welfare for her baby without losing her job (Article 11). \n\nSometimes there are problems with pregnancies. A miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) is when the baby dies before it is born. A stillbirth is when the baby is dead when it is born. There are also diseases caused by pregnancy. \n\nSometimes, women die from giving birth. In developed countries, this is much less common than it used to be. Every year, about 500,000 women die from giving birth, while about 7,000,000 mothers have big problems from giving birth. For example, giving birth can tear the mother's body and cause an obstetric fistula. \n\nA pregnancy can also stop without the baby being born. This is called abortion. Doctors can do things that will stop a pregnancy. Such an abortion is called induced abortion. Countries have different laws about induced abortions. Some countries allow it, and others do not. In some countries, it is allowed, but only for certain reasons, such as the pregnancy resulting from rape, or a doctor saying that the pregnant woman might die if the pregnancy is not stopped. People also have different opinions about abortion. Often, these are influenced by religious beliefs. \n\nThere are a few diseases that can kill a woman or make her very ill if she has a baby. Having abortions could save the lives or health of these mothers. \n\nA pregnancy test is something that women use to tell whether they are pregnant. The woman urinates on the stick. If the woman is pregnant, a plus sign or two lines will appear on the stick. If the woman is not pregnant, then a minus sign or one line will appear on the stick. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-25T13:17:05Z", "text_length": 5598}
{"title": "Hypercholesterolemia", "parsed_text": "Hypercholesterolemia means that the cholesterol level is too high in the blood. \n\nCholesterol is a molecule in cells. It is a type of lipid which is a fat or fat-like molecule. Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a steroid. Steroids are lipids that have a special chemical structure. This structure is made of four rings of carbon atoms. \n\nOther steroids include hormone steroids like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone. In fact, all steroid hormones are made from changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol. When scientists talk about making one molecule from changing simpler ones, they sometimes call it synthesis. \n\nCholesterol is usually in the walls of cells. It is only in animals. Plants do not synthesize cholesterol. So the cholesterol in the food people eat can only come from eating food from animals. But even vegans who eat only plant foods can have cholesterol. This is because most of the cholesterol that is in our bodies is synthesized by our bodies. \n\nCholesterol does many important jobs in a cell. Cholesterols main function is as a structural component of cell membranes. It is also the starting material for bile acids that are made by the liver and used to digest fats, and for steroid hormones. However, it is best known for something bad that it does. High levels of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis. This is an inflammatory disease of artery walls in which white blood cells invade the vessel wall and become engorged with cholesterol and other lipids. These \n\nareas can slowly close off a blood vessel or can suddenly rupture and trigger formation of a blood clot. \n\nNot all cholesterol is bad. There are different kinds of cholesterol in the blood. Doctors often measure these different types to see if someone has hypercholesterolemia. \n\nHDL, an acronym for 'high density lipoprotein' is sometimes called 'good cholesterol' because people with high levels of HDL cholesterol have less atherosclerosis. \n\nLDL (low density lipoprotein) is sometimes called 'bad cholesterol' because people with high levels of LDL cholesterol have more atherosclerosis. \n\nHigh blood levels of VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) also causes more atherosclerosis. However, measuring its level in blood is more expensive. So the blood level of triglycerides (a kind of fat) is used instead. High triglycerides (TG) are found in people with high VLDL. \n\nWhen atherosclerosis gets bad enough, it can cause blockage of blood flow in arteries. This can hurt whatever the artery brings blood to. The organ or tissue that the blocked artery brought blood to can even die. If the organ or tissue dies, doctors call this an infarction. If it is hurt from low blood flow, but not enough to die, it is called ischemia. \n\nIf the artery brought blood to the heart, people can have angina or a heart attack. A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction. Myocardial means relating to the heart muscle. Infarction means death of a tissue or organ. So a myocardial infarction or heart attack is when blood flow to part of the heart stops. Then that part of the heart dies. Angina is when the blood flow is low but not totally blocked. \n\nIf the blocked artery brought blood to the brain, people can have a stroke. If the blocked artery is to the kidneys, it can cause kidney failure. If the blocked artery is to an arm or leg, they may also die. If this happens, the arm or leg may need to be amputated (cut off) if the blood vessel cannot be fixed by doctors. \n\nThe best way to treat it is to not get it! Some people develop atherosclerosis faster than others. Some develop it very slowly. Many things make those differences between people. Some are things people can change. Some are not. \n\nUnchangeable things \n\nGenetics (whether people have good genes or bad ones from their parents.) \n\nSex (men get atherosclerosis earlier than women) \n\nChangeable things \n\nSmoking \n\nControl of diabetes and high blood pressure \n\nExercise \n\nDiet \u2013 the foods a person eats. (low cholesterol, low fat, and more fruits and vegetables is better) \n\nHowever, once someone gets hypercholesterolemia which means high blood cholesterol, doctors treat them. The first way to treat hypercholesterolemia is to exercise, quit smoking, and eat better foods. If these work and the cholesterol blood levels become normal, no more treatment is needed. If these do not work, sometimes medicines are also needed. But even if medicine is used, it is still important to stop smoking, eat better, and exercise. \n\nOnce someone gets atherosclerosis from hypercholesterolemia, a better diet, exercise, and quitting smoking may not be enough. If people already have atherosclerosis that causes problems like heart attack or strokes, medicine is almost always needed. \n\nPeople with atherosclerosis must also be watched by doctors to make sure they do not get ischemia or infarction. Since they are more likely to get a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke, they must watch for signs of these. Sometimes if a doctor thinks a person has atherosclerosis she may do tests to find atherosclerosis before it causes symptoms of ischemia or infarction. But if people get symptoms of these problems, it is important to see a doctor immediately. \n\nFor all of these types of ischemia or infarction, doctors can try to reopen the blocked artery. This may be done by surgery or sometimes with very strong medicines to make the blood less able to make clots. If this is not done fast enough, the tissue or organ with ischemia may be too badly hurt, and it might not be able to be saved. \n\nThe most common type of medicine to treat hypercholesterolemia are 'statin' drugs. They are called 'statins' because their names all end in -statin. They are also called HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors. This is because they work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA Reductase. Inhibiting an enzyme means to make it work less well. \n\nThe HMG-CoA Reductase enzyme causes the body to make more cholesterol. If it is inhibited, the body makes less cholesterol. So statin drugs lower the amount of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood which stops atherosclerosis from getting worse. Statin drugs can even help make atherosclerosis better. However, statins are not as good at increasing the HDL (good) cholesterol. Low HDL is hard to treat with medicines, but goes up with more exercise! \n\nThere are two big problems with taking statins: Liver problems and 'Rhabdomyolysis.' \n\nRhabdomyolysis means a disease where muscle cells are damaged and die. Statins can cause damage to muscle cells. This can cause weakness and muscle pain. The worse problem though is that when muscle cells die, they release cell proteins into the blood. The kidney removes the muscle protein from the blood. If the kidney takes up too much protein, it can be hurt. If it is bad enough it can cause kidney failure. So if people take statins and get muscle pain or weakness, stop the medicine and see a doctor. \n\nStatins can also cause liver problems. They can cause mild irritation of the liver. They can rarely cause very bad liver damage. Because of this, when someone starts taking a statin, doctors check liver blood tests after six weeks. Doctors also warn patients to watch for the signs of liver damage: pain in the right side of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. \n\nHowever, both of these problems are rare. In someone with hypercholesterolemia, the benefit from statins is more than the risk. This means that someone is more likely to prevent problems than cause problems by taking them. There are many big scientific studies of this problem that show the same thing: if people have hypercholesterolemia and take statins, they are more likely to live longer and be healthier. \n\nThere are other kinds of medicines to treat hypercholesterolemia. But statins are the most effective treatment. \n\nFibrates are medicines that lower cholesterol levels. They may also help people with Type II Diabetes. This is a good effect because diabetes and hypercholesterolemia cause some of the same problems. If both diabetes and hypercholesterolemia happen in the same person the problems from these diseases can be much worse. Fibrates can have rhabdomyolysis like the statins and also can cause upset stomach. Use of fibrates and statins at the same time makes rhabdomyolysis happen much more often. \n\nNiacin is a vitamin that lowers cholesterol levels. It is also called Vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid. Severe niacin deficiency in the diet can cause a disease called Pellagra. This is rare in the developed world today. However, less bad deficiency of niacin can cause high blood pressure, weight gain, and hypercholesterolemia. So sometimes Niacin is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Niacin is one of the medicines that may make HDL (good) cholesterol go up. The biggest problem with taking enough Niacin to help cholesterol is that it causes severe flushing (hot, red, sometimes itchy skin). This 'side-effect' is so bad, sometimes people stop taking the medicine. \n\nBile Acid Resins are medicines that make people not absorb as much bile when they digest food. This causes them to take up less cholesterol also, which lowers blood levels of cholesterol.", "timestamp": "2013-06-19T13:06:11Z", "text_length": 9500}
{"title": "Cholera", "parsed_text": "Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It infects the small intestine. \n\nThere are many types (strains) of the Vibrio cholera bacteria. Some of them cause more serious illnesses than others. Because of this, some people who get cholera have no symptoms; others have symptoms that are not very bad, and others have very bad symptoms. \n\nThe most common symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea. In the worst cases, diarrhea can be so bad that people can die in a few hours from dehydration. \n\nCholera is a very old disease. Writings about cholera (written in Sanskrit) have been found from the 5th century BC. Throughout history, there have been many outbreaks and epidemics of cholera. \n\nCholera still affects many people throughout the world. Estimates from 2010 say that between 3 million and 5 million people get cholera every year, and 58,000\u2013130,000 people die from the disease every year. Today, cholera is considered a pandemic. However, it is most common in developing countries, especially in children. \n\nPeople usually get cholera by eating food or drinking water that is unclean. When people have cholera, they have a lot of diarrhea, and the cholera bacteria stays alive in their feces. In developing countries, often there is not good sanitation. Cholera can spread if this diarrhea gets into water that other people use. For example, if sewage (human waste) gets into a river, people can get cholera if they: \n\nDrink the water from the river. \n\nEat food that they have washed in the river. \n\nEat fish that live in the river, if they are not cooked well enough to kill the cholera bacteria. \n\nThis is the most common cause of cholera in developed countries. People eat seafood like oysters that were taken from waters with the cholera bacteria in them and sent to stores in developed countries. \n\nCholera is very rarely spread directly from person to person. \n\nCholera's main symptoms are very bad diarrhea and vomiting clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly. They start half a day to five days after the person gets infected. (This is called cholera's \" incubation period \" .) \n\nIf they do not get treatment, about half of people with very bad cholera die. People with very bad cholera can have so much diarrhea that they do not have enough water and electrolytes (salts) left in their bodies to survive. Cholera has been nicknamed the \" blue death \" because a person dying of cholera may lose so many body fluids that their skin turns bluish-gray. \n\nOther symptoms may include: \n\nLethargy (having no energy) \n\nEyes that look sunken into the head, dry mouth, and saggy skin (from dehydration) \n\nChanges in breathing \n\nConfusion \n\nHypotension (low blood pressure) \n\nTachycardia (fast heart rate) \n\nShock caused by dehydration (called hypovolemic shock) \n\nSeizures (especially in children) \n\nComa, especially in children \n\nIf people with cholera get good, quick medical treatment, less than 1% die from the disease. However, if cholera is not treated, at least half of people with the disease (50% to 60%) die. \n\nSome strains of the Vibrio cholera bacteria have different genes than others, which make them more dangerous. These more dangerous strains of cholera bacteria caused the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India. A person who gets these strains of cholera can die within two hours of getting sick. This means there is very little time to get the person treated. \n\nThere is no cure for cholera. However, there are different treatments that can help. For example: \n\nGiving fluids to treat dehydration, either by mouth or through a needle placed into a vein (intravenously). \n\nGiving important electrolytes like potassium and sodium chloride (salt) \n\nGiving antibiotics (sometimes). These will make symptoms go away faster and not be as bad. However, people will recover without them if they are not too dehydrated. Because of this, antibiotics are suggested for people who have very bad cholera and are very dehydrated. \n\nPatients should keep eating; this helps their intestines return to normal. \n\nThere is a cholera vaccine that can be taken by mouth. It provides some protection from cholera for about six months. \n\nPeople can also do some other things to prevent cholera. For example: \n\nWash their hands with soap and/or ash after using the toilet, and before touching food or eating. \n\nSterilize (remove germs from) all water used for drinking, washing, or cooking. The best and least expensive ways to do this are to boil water or to add chlorine. If this is not possible, using a cloth filter for water is better than nothing. \n\nWash all fruits and vegetables using safe water. Peel fresh fruits before eating them. \n\nNot put their untreated feces in rivers, oceans, or anywhere in the open environment. This can be avoided by using dry toilet <nowiki/> s, especially if governments do not properly treat sewage. \n\nFollow all suggestions from public health agencies like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how to prevent spreading cholera (or other diseases). \n\nGovernments could stop outbreaks or epidemics from happening by improving sanitation. For example, cholera is very uncommon in developed countries because they have good sanitation and because they add chemicals to their water to kill germs. Even after people start to get cholera, it is possible for governments to stop the disease from spreading, though: \n\nSterilization: Any material that touched a cholera patient should be cleaned with disinfectant and washed in hot water, using chlorine bleach if possible. Hands that touched cholera patients or their things, like clothing or blankets, should be carefully cleaned and disinfected with water that has chlorine in it, or with other effective antimicrobial agents (chemicals that will kill bacteria). \n\nSewage: Proper treatment can kill enough cholera bacteria for wastewater to go back into the environment. Dry toilet <nowiki/> s can be promoted where sewage treatment is not so good. \n\nSources: Warnings about possible cholera in the water should be posted around contaminated water sources, with directions on how to kill the bacteria in the water through things like boiling or adding chlorine for possible use. \n\nCholera probably started in the Indian subcontinent. As early as the 5th century BC, people in the Ganges River delta area wrote about cholera. The disease first spread to Russia in 1817 by trade routes (over both land and sea). Later, cholera spread to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world. \n\nSeven cholera pandemics have happened in the past 200 years. The latest started in Indonesia in 1961. There have also been many serious outbreaks. The worst outbreak in recent history happened in Haiti after the earthquake there in 2010. Between October 2010 and August 2015, more than 700,000 Haitians got cholera, and over 9,000 died. The outbreak was caused by a United Nations base where Nepalese soldiers were living. The soldiers would dump human waste into the Artibonite River, which many Haitians used for drinking, cooking, and bathing. \n\nSince cholera became common in the 19th century, it has killed tens of millions of people. Just in Russia, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died of cholera. During the second pandemic, which lasted from 1827-1835, the disease killed 150,000 Americans. \n\n</ref> Between 1900 and 1920, in India, up to eight million people died of cholera. \n\nin 1854, an English doctor named John Snow was the first person to realize that contaminated water caused cholera. Today, countries in Europe and North America filter and add chlorine to their water supplies. This has made cholera very uncommon in these countries. \n\nInformation about cholera in Simple English from the CDC \n\nCDC facts about cholera \n\nWHO facts about cholera \n\nRehydration Project talks about ORSs (oral rehydration solutions)", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:41:17Z", "text_length": 9719}

{"title": "Malaria", "parsed_text": "Malaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in most parts of India and other tropical countries. It is most comman health problems. As per latest WHO estimates (2011)between 149\u2013274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa. \n\nThis amounts to one malaria death every minute. In India the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). \n\nMalaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite: it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood. The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year. \n\n(from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid 1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% indian population lives in malaria risk areas. \n\nThe parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'Plasmodium'. Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans. \n\nPeople usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes: they are the vectors of the disease. The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The Plasmodium is in the mosquito's special saliva. The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by-product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria. \n\nOnly the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs. \n\nSome people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called maternal-foetal transmission. People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion. This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them. \n\nThere are several species (kinds) of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans: \n\nserious disease: \n\nPlasmodium falciparum \n\nmilder disease: \n\nPlasmodium malariae \n\nPlasmodium ovale \n\nPlasmodium vivax \n\nspecies which normally infect other primates: \n\nPlasmodium knowesli \n\nP. vivax and P. falciparum cause the most malaria in people. Falciparum malaria is the worst kind, and kills the most people. \n\nWhen Plasmodium enters the blood, they are then called sporozoites. Sporozoites go to the liver, where they make many more sporozoites. Then they change into a different form of Plasmodium. This form is the merozoite. The merozoites go into the red blood cells, then they make many more merozoites. \n\nThe merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again. When they do this, the person gets very sick, and shows symptoms of malaria. This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm. \n\nP. vivax and P. ovale can live in the liver for a long time. A person can look well, but still have the Plasmodium in the liver. This is called a dormant phase. Weeks or months later, the Plasmodium can leave the liver to the blood, and the person will get sick again. \n\nP. falciparum is the most dangerous type of malaria. It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria, because there are more of them in the blood. Also, with falciparum malaria, the red blood cells are sticky. This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels. If blood vessels are blocked, this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to, and can hurt people's organs. \n\nPregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria. When they get malaria, they get sicker. \n\n40% of people live in a place where there is malaria. Malaria is in these places: \n\nAfrica \n\nAsia (mostly in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia) \n\nCentral and South America \n\nHispaniola \n\nEastern Europe \n\nSouth Pacific (the part of the Pacific Ocean south of the equator) \n\nEvery year, 300 to 700 million people get malaria. It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa. Most of the people who die from malaria are children. Even if children do not die, many have brain damage. \n\nMany of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control. But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries. These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes, or to give people medicine. Money, however, is not the only problem. A country must have an organised medical system to provide services. Many countries in central Africa have been disrupted by warfare and conflict between groups, and general unrest. Also, easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did 50 years ago. This is because the insects are resistant to many insecticides, and the Plasmodium parasite is highly resistant to quinine and most other common drugs. This is a normal evolutionary process: the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms, and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply. \n\nSymptoms are changes in someone's body that are signs for a disease. Most people who get malaria get symptoms 10\u201330 days after they get infected (the Plasmodium gets in their blood.) But some people can get symptoms after only a week, and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year. \n\nThe most common symptom of malaria is fever, when the body temperature is high. The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly. The people who have malaria often feel like they had influenza. \n\nSymptoms of malaria are: \n\nArthralgia (pain in joints) \n\nHeadache (pain in head) \n\nFeeling very tired or sleepy \n\nCough \n\nChills (feeling very cold) \n\nDelirium (when people are very confused because of a disease. They may look drunk. They may not be able to talk.) \n\nComa (when people are not conscious. They look like they are asleep, but they cannot be woken. ) \n\nSigns of malaria: \n\nAnemia (low red blood cell levels in the blood) \n\nDiarrhea \n\nJaundice (yellow skin and eyes) \n\nSweating \n\nVomiting \n\nFast heart rate \n\nLow blood pressure \n\nEnlarged organs. When something becomes enlarged or BIGGER than normal the word often ends in -megaly. \n\nHepatomegaly -enlarged liver, splenomegaly - enlarged spleen, or both hepatosplenomegaly. When these organs become enlarged it may cause pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. \n\nComplications are problems that happen because of a disease. \n\nPregnant women and young children have more complications. People who get malaria for the first time have more complications. Falciparum malaria has the most complications. \n\n<span style= \" padding:0 2em; \"> Complications of malaria </span> \n\nComplications of malaria are: \n\nCerebral malaria (brain malaria) \n\nTo have cerebral malaria, the following must be present: \n\nP. falciparum in the blood. \n\nComa, many seizures, or long delirium \n\nIf no treatment is given, death often occurs. \n\nEven if treatment is given, 15%-20% of people with it die. \n\nSeizures (if only one seizure happens it is not cerebral malaria) \n\nDamage to the brain \n\nBlackwater fever \n\nMany red blood cells break open and the hemoglobin in the cells gets into the blood. \n\nThis hemoglobin is put in the urine and makes it look very dark. \n\nWithout the right care this can make the kidneys stop working. \n\nPulmonary oedema \n\nThis is fluid in the lungs that makes it hard to breathe. \n\nPregnant women get this much more. \n\n80% of people who get this complication die. \n\nVery low blood sugar \n\nChildren and pregnant women get this more. \n\nThis can cause people to look like they are drunk or to be in a coma. \n\nHemolysis \n\nThis means breakdown of red blood cells. \n\nIt can cause blackwater fever, jaundice, and symptoms of anemia. \n\nCoagulopathy (not being able to stop bleeding) \n\n<table border= \" 0 \" style= \" background:#ffe; float:right; width:370px; \" cellpadding= \" 2 \" cellspacing= \" 3 \"> \n\n<caption> Malaria microscopy </caption> \n\n<tr> <td rowspan= \" 3 \"> </td> \n\n<td rowspan= \" 2 \" style= \" vertical-align:top; \"> \n\n</td> \n\n<td> \n\n</td> \n\n</tr> \n\n<tr> \n\n<td> <br> \n\n</td> \n\n</tr> \n\n<tr> \n\n<td valign= \" top \"> A technician looks for the malaria parasite in blood films (blood smears). \n\n</td> \n\n<td valign= \" top \"> Microscopic view of malaria parasites in a blood smear. Arrows point to infected red blood cells. </td> </tr> \n\n</table> \n\nA clinical diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms of a disease, it is a diagnosis made without medical testing. In the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever. \n\nAny clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible. \n\nA Malaria rapid diagnostic test is a blood test which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes. RDTs are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks, and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary. \n\nTo see if patients have malaria, doctors may do a blood test. This test is called a Giemsa blood smear. Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass. The Giemsa stain is put on the slide. This stain helps doctors see the malaria. Then they look at the slide under a microscope. The Plasmodium is seen in the red blood cells. \n\nPeople with different kinds of malaria need different medicines. The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind. So it is very important to know which species of Plasmodium the person has. \n\nIf the species is not known, the person should be given medicine and care like they have falciparum malaria the worst kind. \n\nIt is also important to know where the person got malaria. Plasmodium in some places is resistant to some medicines. So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America. \n\nEverywhere except New Guinea, the treatment is the same. In New Guinea most P. vivax is resistant to chloroquine. It can be treated with quinine, but this medicine can make people sick. Everywhere else, non-falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine. \n\nChloroquine kills the Plasmodium in the blood. But the Plasmodium in the liver is not killed by chloroquine. P. vivax and P. ovale both stay in the liver a long time. This is the dormant phase. Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for P. vivax and P. ovale. This is to kill the Plasmodium in the liver. The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is primaquine. In southeast Asia, some P. vivax is resistant to primaquine. Most other places, primaquine works very well. \n\nSome people get very sick from primaquine. So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD-deficiency before they take primaquine. \n\nFalciparum is the worst kind of malaria. People with falciparum malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are: \n\nVery sick \n\nChildren \n\nPregnant \n\nHaving malaria for the first time \n\nNot able to take medicines by mouth \n\nEven people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8 hours. This is to make sure they do not get sicker.It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth. Malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated. \n\nFalciparum malaria also has more resistance to medicines. This makes it much harder to treat. Falciparum malaria is always treated with two or more medicines. Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria. Different places have P. falciparum that is resistant to different medicines. \n\nThe most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance. In some places in the world, P. falciparum is killed by chloroquine. In some places it is chloroquine-resistant. This means chloroquine does not kill it. In these places quinine can be used. Quinine is taken by mouth. \n\nThere are three ways to prevent malaria: \n\nControl mosquitoes \n\nKeep mosquitoes from biting \n\nTake medicine to keep from getting sick after a bite, especially in those parts of the world where people get malaria. \n\nVector control is one way to stop malaria. Vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism. For malaria, the vector is the Anopheles mosquito. \n\nThe most used method of vector control is pesticides. These are chemicals that kill the mosquito. The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT. DDT worked very well for vector control. It killed mosquitoes. It did not make people very sick at the time it was used. It did not cost very much money. Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet. \n\nIn many places mosquitoes became resistant to DDT. This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas. Scientists worried that DDT was making people and animals sick. It killed a lot of wildlife too. DDT also stays in the environment for a long time. For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control. Organophosphate or carbonate pesticides are used, like malathion or bendiocarb. \n\nVector control is not the only way to stop malaria. And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control. The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods. In some places, DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria. This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria. \n\nThe mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn (when the sun comes up) and dusk (when the sun goes down.) Be most careful at these times. Wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves. Wear mosquito repellent (this is a chemical that mosquitoes do not like, so they do not bite.) Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth. So repellent should be used on skin and clothes. \n\nPesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes. When sleeping outside, people use a mosquito net. This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out. It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out. Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping. It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin, which repels and kills mosquitoes. \n\nPeople can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria. This reduces the chances that they contract malaria. This is called prophylaxis. \n\nSome people take prophylactic medicines for years. Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine. \n\nPeople who live where there is no malaria usually have not had malaria. The first case malaria is usually much worse. So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria. The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are. This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place. \n\nTo make them work best, prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way. The medicine should start before going to an area with malaria. Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home. One medicine (Malarone) only needs to be used for one week after coming home. \n\nThere are some children in Tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria. Researchers are using this to develop a new vaccine. U.S. researchers have found the children produce an antibody which attacks the malaria-causing parasite. Injecting a form of this antibody into mice protected the animals from the disease. The researchers plan to do tests on primates, including humans. \n\nIt was Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, working in the Presidency General Hospital in the Kolkata, who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were used during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease. \n\nThe first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria. The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted. It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by French chemists. \n\nIn the early 20th century, before antibiotics became available, Julius Wagner-Jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria. The resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes, and quinine could be administered to control the malaria. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. \n\nMalaria was the largest hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected. Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the North African and South Pacific campaigns. \n\nPlasmodium \n\nAntibiotic resistance \n\nmalarial drugs side effect \n\nVideo: Life Cycle of Malaria Parasite in the Mosquito \n\nWHO malaria information \n\nUS Centers for Disease Control: Malaria \n\nMedline Plus about malaria", "timestamp": "2020-07-01T12:36:24Z", "text_length": 20496}
{"title": "Testicle", "parsed_text": "Testicles are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures. Male mammals, including humans, have two testicles, supported in a sac of skin below the penis called the scrotum. Along with the penis, testicles are called reproductory organs or \" sex organs \" . Only males have testicles; females have ovaries. \n\nTesticles are a type of organ called glands. Like other glands, testicles make chemical substances, called hormones that keep the body working. Testicles also make sperm, which can join with ova to make new life. \n\nMost glands, like women's ovaries, are inside the body, but testicles are outside the main part of the body. This is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body. In cold weather, testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm. \n\nThe testicles are firm, oval-shaped glands. Most testicles match in size, but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others. Normal sized testicles are between 14 cm\u00b3 to 35 cm\u00b3. \n\nMost men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one. Scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other. It is usually, but not always, the left testicle that hangs lower. \n\nThe testicles hang in the scrotum by the spermatic cord. They are outside the body because they need to be cooler than the temperature inside the body, in order to make sperm. If a man's testicles get cold, they are automatically pulled closer to the body. The spermatic cord is tightened by the cremasteric muscle. When this muscle contracts (pulls tighter), the cord gets shorter, which pulls the testicles closer to the body. If the testicles are too warm, the cremasteric muscle relaxes (gets longer.) This lowers the testicles to keep them cooler. This is how the testicles are kept at the right temperature. This is called the cremasteric reflex. (A reflex is something your body automatically does without you thinking about it.) \n\nThere are other uses for the cremasteric reflex apart from making the testicles the right temperature. Stress can also make the cremasteric reflex work. If a male human or mammal gets into a fight, then its testicles are in danger. They automatically pull up close to the body. The cremasteric reflex also happens during sexual intercourse. \n\nTesticles have two important jobs in the body. They are part of two of the body's systems, the endocrine system which keeps the body working, and the reproductive system which makes new life. \n\nTesticles are a type of organ called glands. (This makes them part of the body's endocrine system.) The human body has many types of glands. The job of glands within a body is to make chemical substances, and put them out into the body's system. A body has lots of different systems that keep it in good working order all the time, and that also provide for a body's special needs. Some of the body's special needs happen when a person gets angry, frightened or sick, or if the person wants to have sexual intercourse. At these times a body uses more of some types of chemical substance, so the glands that make them work harder. \n\nTesticles make several types of chemical substances. They are not simple chemicals, but are very complicated and very important to life. Making these substances is controlled by the pituitary gland which is a small gland in the brain. \n\nOne substance made by the testicles is a type of substance known as a hormone. It is the hormone testosterone. Testosterone is important in a male person's body, because it makes him grow into a man and feel like a man during puberty. (Women's bodies make some testosterone too, but they make more female hormone called estrogen.) \n\nAs well as being chemical-producing glands, testicles are gonads. (This makes them part of the body's reproductive system.) Apart from hormones, the other important substances made by the testicles are spermatozoa, which are generally just called sperm. (The word \" sperm \" is plural, so you do not add an \" s \" and say \" sperms \" .) The sperm are tiny living cells which can join with another cell, called an \" ovum \" (or egg) inside a female, to start a new human life. Scientists call making sperm spermatogenesis. Boys begin making sperm when they start growing into men, at a time of life called puberty. \n\nFemales do not have testicles. The glands in their bodies that do the same sort of jobs as testicles are called ovaries. They have two ovaries, but unlike testicles, ovaries are inside the body, on either side of the uterus. They release ova (or eggs) and female hormones. Ovaries and testicles are sometimes called \" gonads \" . \n\n:(See the picture, right) \n\nThe testicles, inside the scrotum, are covered with a tough type of white protective skin called a membrane. \n\nThe inner part of the testicles have many small tubes called seminiferous tubules which are coiled (or twisted around). Sperm are made inside the seminiferous tubules. \n\nThe sperm pass through some small tubes called ducts into another part at the back of the testicle, called the epididymis, which is where the sperm cells finish maturing. \n\nThe sperm cells then travel along a tube called the vas deferens until they reach the urethra. \n\nThe urethra is the main tube in the penis and leads to the opening at the end called the urethral opening. The urethral opening is also the way that urine leaves the body from the bladder. \n\nWhen a man feels sexual desire, sperm cells go through the ejaculatory duct. They are combined with liquid called seminal fluid from a gland called the prostate. The prostate also has muscles that push the sperm and fluid into the urethra. \n\nDuring sexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing the sperm comes out through the urethral opening when a man ejaculates. \n\nIf the sperm from the testicles enters the vagina of a woman during sexual intercourse, it may pass into the uterus and join with a mature ovum (or egg) to begin a new baby. \n\nSize in animals \n\nStudying animals can help in understanding things about people. In mammals, testicles can be very big or very small in relation to the size of the animal itself. The size has to do with the amount of sperm that the male animal needs to make. Some types of male animal generally only have one sexual partner at a time and are called monogamous. Some types of animals generally live in a herd or flock where one male will have many female sexual partners. These males are called polygamous. More sperm is needed by polygamous males than by monogamous males. Polygamous males generally have larger testicles than monogamous males. The testicles grow larger to make more sperm. \n\nSize in men \n\nMost men's testicles are from 14 cm\u00b3 to 35 cm\u00b3. This is a measure of volume. Sometimes Doctors need to measure a man's testicles to see if there is a problem. Doctors can measure the volume of testicles in two ways: \n\nOrchidometer \u2013 This is a set of small objects that look like eggs. They are many different sizes. The doctor picks the one that is the size of the testicle. Doctors know what size the orchidometer is. Then they know the size of the testicle. \n\nMeasuring the size \u2013 with a ruler, calipers, or ultrasound. Then these lengths are used to calculate the volume. \n\nSometimes the size of a man's testicles changes. \n\nSome reasons why testicles get smaller are: \n\nIf a man takes testosterone, the testicles do not have to work to make testosterone, so they become smaller. \n\nIf a man's testicles are kept more warm than usual, they make less sperm. So if they are kept too warm, they get smaller. \n\nIf testicles are injured(hurt) they can become smaller. \n\nSome reasons why testicles get bigger are: \n\nIf a man takes hormones from the pituitary gland, (called gonadotropins), it can make testicles bigger. Gonadtropins are the hormones that tell the testicles to make sperm and testosterone. \n\nSome diseases cause testicles to swell. \n\nThe most important diseases of testicles are: \n\nInflammation of the testicles. This is called orchitis \n\nTesticular cancer \n\nFluid around a testicle. This is called a hydrocele \n\nInflammation of the epididymis. This is called epididymitis \n\nSpermatic cord torsion. This is also called Testicular torsion. It is a medical emergency. It is when the cord that the testicle hangs from gets twisted. It can happen when running. \n\nVaricocele - swollen veins to the testes. Varicocele happens more on the left. \n\nLoss and injury \n\nMost boys are born with two testicles in the scrotum. The testicles have formed inside the baby's body, but moved into the scrotum before the birth. Sometimes one or both the testicles are still inside when the baby is born. Sometimes an operation is needed to fix this. \n\nIf a testicle is injured, it is extremely painful. Sometimes testicles get crushed. Sometimes it is necessary for a doctor to remove one or both the testicles. This operation is called an orchidectomy. If a man loses a testicle, a doctor can put a testicular prosthesis (false testicle) into the scrotum. It looks and feels like a testicle. \n\nIf a male loses both his testicles it's called castration. Because the man cannot produce sperm or testosterone, it has a big effect on the man's life. Because he cannot make sperm, he cannot have children. And because he cannot make the male hormone testosterone, he becomes less like a male. He may lose some of his muscles, and put on weight. A man who has lost his testicles may take testosterone medicine so that he does not have these changes. \n\nUntil the 1700s in Europe, and more recently in some countries, there was a custom to castrate young male slaves and boys. Young slaves were castrated so that they could be used as guards over the wives of rich men. It meant that the wives would not fall in love with their guards. Sometimes young boys who had beautiful singing voices were castrated before puberty. This meant that their voices would stay high all their lives. These singing men were called castrati. \n\nCastrating animals \n\nIt is very common to castrate (remove the testicles from) male domestic animals. Male dogs and cats that are castrated do not fight so much, and do not stray around looking for females to mate with. \n\nMale horses are usually castrated so that they become more calm and safer to ride. A castrated male horse is called a gelding. A male horse that is not castrated is a stallion. \n\nMale animals that are used for meat are generally castrated because it makes them fatter and also makes them quieter to keep because they do not fight each other. Most male cattle are castrated. \n\nTesticles can also be called \" testes \" or \" gonads \" . \n\nThere are many slang words for testicles, like balls, nuts, bollocks, nads, crown jewels, testies, marbles, ding dangs, boy toys, nicnaks, plums,tattay (in Urdu) etc. Slang words are other names that are used for fun or to be vulgar (rude). \n\nCryptorchidism (cryptorchismus) \n\nInfertility \n\nList of homologues of the human reproductive system \n\nOrchidometer \n\nSpermatogenesis \n\nSterilization (surgical procedure), vasectomy \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-19T07:07:27Z", "text_length": 11499}

{"title": "Pain", "parsed_text": "Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick. It is a bad sensation that is physical and emotional. \n\nMost pain starts when part of the body is hurt. Nerves in that part send messages to the brain. Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged. Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain. It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage. \n\nThe message that the nerve sends to the brain is called nociception. What is experienced because of the nociception is pain. \n\nPain can be acute or chronic. Acute means it only happens a short time. Chronic means the pain lasts a long time. \n\nPain can be from different types of injury: \n\nCutaneous pain is from damage to the skin. This is the pain a person feels when their wrist is cut with a knife. \n\nVisceral pain is from damage to the organs inside the body \u2013 like the stomach, kidney, and heart. This is the pain a person feels when they have an ulcer. \n\nSomatic pain is from muscles, bones, and joints. This is the pain a person feels when they sprain (twist) a joint like the ankle. \n\nPain can also happen when there is no underlying injury or cause. Pain can happen just because the nerves do not work right. This is called neuropathic pain. \n\nFor most pain, the best treatment is to stop the damage that makes the pain. If the ankle is sprained, doctors tell the person not to walk on it. They tell them to put ice on it. This helps the injury stop. For an ulcer in the stomach, doctors stop the acid made in the stomach. This helps the ulcer to heal. \n\nBut many kinds of pain also need medicines to feel better. There are many different kinds of medicines for pain: \n\nNSAIDs (acronym for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). These medicines decrease the inflammation where the person is hurt. They also work in the brain to decrease pain. Examples are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. These medicines can make someone sleepy but they are not addictive. They can cause problems with kidneys and with peptic ulcers. \n\nOpioids are narcotic pain relievers. They do not have the kidney and stomach problems that NSAIDs have. But they can make someone very sleepy and have other potential side effects, such as lack of coordination, inability to concentrate, blurred vision, and weight gain. They can be addictive. \n\nAcetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol) is not a narcotic or an NSAID. So it is much safer than either one, but can cause liver damage. \n\nAnti-seizure medicines (also called antiepileptics or anti-convulsants) \u2013 many of these medicines work for chronic neuropathic pain. Other pain medicines may not work at all for those kinds of pain. Examples are carbamazepine and gabapentin. \n\nAnti-depression medicines can also help chronic pain, even if it is not neuropathic pain. This is partly because of an affect on pain itself. But it also helps, because living in chronic pain can cause depression. \n\nThere are doctors who specialize in pain management. These are usually anesthesiologists but may also have any one of a number of underlying areas of specialization, such as neurology, physiatry, or internal medicine. \n\nA new genetic method of treating chronic pain is in the research stage. The idea is to inactivate (turn off) gene HCN2, which plays a key role in chronic pain.

{"title": "Testicular cancer", "parsed_text": "Testicular cancer is cancer in one or both testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. In the United States, about 8,000 to 9,000 people are diagnosed with the cancer every year. Every male has a 1 in 250 (four tenths of one percent, or 0.4%) chance of being diagnosed with it. It is most common among males aged 15-40 years. Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers; more than 90%. This is most often achieved by removing one or both testicles. Even in the small number of cases where the cancer has spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 50%. \n\nBecause testicular cancer is curable (stage I can have a success rate of > 95%) when detected early, experts recommend regular monthly testicular self-examination after a hot shower or bath, when the scrotum is looser. Men are advised to feel each testicle, feeling for pea-shaped lumps. \n\nSymptoms of testicular cancer include one or more of the following: \n\na lump in one testis or a hardening of one of the testicles \n\npain and tenderness in the testicles \n\nbuild-up of fluid in the scrotum \n\na dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin \n\na change in the size of a testicle \n\nblood in semen \n\nHow bad the cancer is and whether it is present at all is often discovered through ultrasound of the testicles, x-rays, and/or CT scans.

{"title": "Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder", "parsed_text": "Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (often shortened to OCD) is a mental disorder that causes repeated and unwanted thoughts and/or feelings (obsessions) and actions (compulsions). Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the individual to believe that if a task is not completed, something bad may happen. Such a task may be washing hands many times. This belief leads to more anxiety and tension. The actions that someone takes to stop the thoughts and feelings can take more than an hour every day.\u00a0OCD can limit one's ability to take part in relationships, the workplace, and in society in general. OCD affects around 1.2% of the world's population, and it affects the lives of around 15%. In the United States, about one in fifty adults has OCD. \n\nSomeone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder has thoughts called obsessions. A thought that is an obsession will happen many times and is a thought that the person does not want to have. Different people will have different obsessive thoughts. Some people have obsessions about God, the Devil, or another religious figure hurting them or someone they love. Other people have obsessions about sex. They may think about things like kissing, having sex with, or touching people around them. People with OCD may worry that they will act on these thoughts. \n\nSome people have obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder without compulsions. This is called \" primarily obsessional OCD \" , or \" pure-O \" . It is thought that up to half of all people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder have primarily obsessional OCD. People with primarily obsessional OCD may have a third type of obsession; that is aggressive thoughts. People with aggressive thoughts may have obsessions about hurting or killing themselves or people around them. Instead of performing compulsions, people with primarily obsessional OCD may act out compulsions in their mind or avoid the things and places that cause the obsessions. \n\nMany people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder act in a certain way to stop the obsessive thought. These specific actions are known as compulsions. To someone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, doing these compulsions are a way to stop the obsessive thought. They may also think that doing the compulsion will stop something bad from happening to them or someone they care about. \n\nMany compulsions are similar to body tics, and up to 40% of people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder have a tic disorder. Some examples of compulsion include: \n\nHand washing \n\nCleaning themselves or things around them \n\nDoing something (like turning lights on and off) a certain number of times \n\nPutting objects in certain orders \n\nCounting to a certain number many times \n\nChecking that they did some action, usually checking a certain number of times \n\nPeople with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder usually know that their compulsions do not make sense, but do them anyways to stop the feelings of panic or anxiety. People with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder may do their compulsions for hours every day. Their compulsions can also hurt them, such as compulsive hand washing making their hands red and cut. \n\nThe cause of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder is unknown. There is evidence that genes have a strong role in developing the disorder. If the disorder starts in childhood, it is more likely that other family members will have OCD than if the disorder starts in adulthood. It is thought that obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder is the result of things humans did when they were evolving. \n\nThere are four DSM diagnostic criteria for obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder: \n\nThe person has to have obsessions, compulsions, or both. The DSM defines obsessions as thoughts that happen multiple times that the person does not want. The person has to try to get rid of the thoughts. The DSM defines compulsions as actions done multiple times because of an obsession. These actions are done to reduce the stress caused by an obsession. \n\nThe obsessions or compulsions take a lot of time or cause lots of problems in the person\u2019s life. \n\nThe symptoms are not caused by a drug or a different medical problem. \n\nThe problems are not closer to the problems caused by other mental disorders such as an anxiety disorder or body dysmorphic disorder. \n\nThere is another mental disorder similar to obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder called Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD. The difference between the two is that people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder know that something is wrong and become stressed because of their obsessive thoughts. People with obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder do not know that something is wrong, and they like their obsessions and compulsions. \n\nBehavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are used to help people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. The therapy works by making people be in places where they have their obsessive thoughts. They are then made to not do their compulsion. Over time, the person becomes used to the place or things that causes them to have their obsessive thoughts. An example of this is someone who is afraid of dirt having dirt put on their hands without being able to wash it off. \n\nThe medicines that are usually used are called \" selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \" , or SSRIs. These medicines work by stopping a chemical in the brain called serotonin from working. This causes the obsessive thoughts to happen less. In adults, SSRIs are used for people with moderate or severe issues. In children, SSRIs are used after or with therapy for people with severe issues. \n\nIf SSRIs do not work, it is possible for a doctor to give someone with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder anti-psychotic medicines. Doctors may use both medication and counseling for those with the disorder, and they find that this approach works best. \n\nSurgery can be used to help people if other treatments do not work. In the United States, surgery is not done unless medicine and therapy have not worked multiple times. In the United Kingdom, surgery cannot be done unless cognitive behavioral therapy has not worked. \n\nTherapy can be used to reduce the compulsions in children and young adults. Family involvement is very important in treating children. Family also can give the child positive reinforcement for not doing their compulsive behaviors. \n\nIn Europe from the 14th to 16th centuries, it was thought that people who had obsessive thoughts were possessed. They would treat these people by performing sometimes dangerous exorcisms to remove the Devil or evil spirit from the person. In the 1910s, a doctor named Sigmund Freud said that obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder was because of fighting in someone's head. He said that these fights start in childhood when someone gains a \" touching phobia \" , which fights with the natural want to touch things. \n\nThere are several movies and television shows that show people with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. The movie The Aviator shows the life of Howard Hughes. Hughes was afraid of germs, and his obsessions and compulsions were about keeping germs away. English footballer David Beckham has talked about his obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Television hosts Howie Mandel and Marc Summers have also talked about their obsessions and compulsions. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-22T15:42:17Z", "text_length": 10303}

{"title": "Asthma", "parsed_text": "Asthma (or Asthma bronchiale) is a disease that hurts the airways inside the lungs. It causes the tissue inside the airways to swell. Asthma also causes the bands of muscle around the airways to become narrow. This makes it hard for enough air to pass through and for the person to breathe normally. Asthma also causes mucus-making cells inside the airways to make more mucus than normal. This blocks the airways, which are already very narrow during an asthma attack, and makes it even more difficult to breathe. \n\nA person having an asthma attack often makes wheezing sounds when trying to breathe. This is the sound of air trying to pass through the very narrow airway. They also have shortness of breath, which means they cannot take a full deep breath. Chest tightness may happen which feels like their chest is being squeezed. They may also cough a lot. \n\nAsthma attacks can be a medical emergency because they can be fatal (cause a person to die). There is no cure for asthma. There are treatments such as different kinds of medicines to help people with asthma. There are also things that people with asthma can do to help themselves to keep their asthma from getting worse. \n\nThere are a lot of risk factors for getting asthma. The exact reasons for each is not yet clearly understood. Some of the factors are believed to come from genetics. A person inherits genetic mutations from one or both of their parents that may increase the chances of developing asthma. Epigenetics, which are changes in the way a gene acts, may also increase their chances of getting asthma. These epigenetic changes may also be inherited. They may happen when a baby is still growing inside its mother, or during childhood. \n\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is also believed to play a part in developing asthma. A person's socioeconomic status is based on such things as how much money their family makes, where they live, and their education level. Race and ethnicity also may play a part. It also is related to access to medical care, personal beliefs, and dietary habits. People of lower socioeconomic status suffer higher rates of asthma, have worse outcomes, and also have higher asthma-related death rates than people of higher economic status. \n\nThe exact cause of asthma is not yet known. It is believed that it may be because of a of many different reasons: \n\nGenetics: When changes happen in a person's genes (called mutations) these changes are passed on to their children. One or both parents may have these changes or mutations in their genes, and some or all of their children may be born with them, which means they inherited them. These mutations, once they happen, run in families from one generation to the next and are permanent mutations, they change the gene in the DNA. These changes can make a person more likely to get certain diseases like asthma. In some diseases it may be only one change in one gene that may make a person get that disease, in asthma it may be changes in many different genes that may make a person more likely to get asthma. \n\nEpigenetics changes or modifications cause different kind of changes that affect how a person's genes work or 'express themselves' in three different ways (called epigenetic mechanisms), but do not change the gene in the DNA. These epigenetic changes may be inherited, or they may happen in utero which is when a baby is still inside its mother. They may also happen in childhood, because of different reasons, like a respiratory infection, being exposed to chemicals or drugs, diet etc. These changes can be passed from one generation to the next but are not permanent and might only be passed down one or two generations. Even though epigenetic changes affect how a person's genes work they do not permanently change a person's genes. It is believed epigenetic changes may also make a person more likely to get certain diseases like asthma. \n\nEnvironmental factors are things that affect a person; which can be either healthy or unhealthy. Unhealthy environmental factors are things like living in an area where there is a lot of air pollution, or living somewhere where there are lots of bugs in the house, or being around cigarette smoke. \n\nIf a person who has genetic or epigentic changes in their genes that makes them have a bigger chance of getting asthma (genetic predisposition), also has unhealthy environmental factors in their life, like living in a home that has a lot of dust mites, then it is more likely that they will get asthma. \n\nAtopy \n\nAtopy is when there are changes in some of the genes a person is born with (genetic inheritance). These genetic changes make their body produce more Immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody. They are also more sensitive to things things like chemicals, smoke and dust (environmental antigens). This hypersensitivity means they are more sensitive or allergic to things in the environment than people who do not have these changes in their genes and are not hypersensitive or allergic. \n\nThis hypersensitivity causes their body to react in certain ways. Usually a person who is atopic develops allergic rhinitis which affects the nasal passages which are behind the nose and they are also more likely to get atopic dermatitis which causes skin rashes and atopic asthma. Up to 40% of people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma. These three medical problems, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and atopic asthma are called the Atopic Triad (a triad is when there is three of something). People who are atopic may also have other medical problems including food and drug allergies, stinging-insect hypersensitivity, hives (urticaria), Quincke's edema (angioedema), and contact dermatitis. \n\nIf a person has one parent who is atopic they have a chance of being atopic too. If they have two parents who are atopic they have an even bigger chance of being atopic. \n\nAcetaminophen and asthma \n\nThere have been studies that show a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and asthma. For instance a 2008 analysis of information collected from a very large study called the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, or the \" Isaac study \" for short, showed that children who had taken acetaminophen for a fever during the first year of their life had a 50% higher risk of getting asthma later on. Beasley RW, Clayton TO, Crane J, et al, ISAAC Phase Three Study Group. Acetaminophen use and risk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in adolescents: International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase Three. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011 Jan 15;183(2):171-8. \n\nAcetaminophen use and risk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in adolescents: International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase Three. \n\nPMID 20709817 </ref> The more acetaminophen children took the higher their risk of getting asthma. Children who took it once a month had threefold increase in their risk of getting asthma. An increase in asthma rates in multiple countries corresponded with increased sales of drugs which contained acetaminophen. Previously the American College of Physicians reported a link between non-atopic asthma and acetaminophen use based on results of The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Not all doctors are convinced of the link between acetaminophen and asthma. \n\n\" Children with asthma or at risk for asthma should avoid the use of acetaminophen. \" (McBride JT, 2011 ). \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Atopic asthma </font> \n\nAtopic asthma is the most common form of asthma. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Cough-variant asthma </font> \n\nCough-variant asthma is a type of asthma in which a cough is the main, and sometimes only sign. Cough-variant asthma usually does not cause wheezing or breathlessness and causes a dry, scratchy, mostly nonproductive cough (this means little or no phlegm is coughed up). About 30% of people who have cough-variant asthma will develop typical asthma. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Work-related asthma </font> \n\nWork related asthma are types of asthma that are caused or made worse by irritants in the environment at a person's place of work. The kind of jobs that may cause work related asthma are usually those in which there is a lot of smoke or chemicals are used. There are different types of work-related asthma (WRA): \n\n1. Occupational asthma with latency: this asthma type is when the signs and symptoms of asthma occur after a period of time (latency) after being exposed to the environmental irritants. e.g.: John starts working at a factory where chemicals are used the first week of January. At the end of March he starts developing the signs and symptoms of asthma. The period of time from when he started the job in January to when the signs and symptoms of asthma started in March is the latency period. \n\n2. Irritant-Induced Asthma (IIA) is occupational asthma without latency: this is an asthma type is when the signs and symptoms of asthma can occur immediately (without latency) after being exposed to the environmental irritants. e.g. Frank starts a new job working as a janitor where he uses ammonia to clean. After opening the bottle of ammonia and breathing the fumes Frank starts finding it difficult to breath, his chest tightens up and he develops other signs and symptoms of asthma. \n\n::3. Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS): \n\n4. Work-aggravated asthma: this is when a person already has asthma and environmental triggers at their place of work makes it worse. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Exercise induced asthma </font> \n\nExercise induced asthma (EIA) - also called exercise induced bronchospasm - is the term used to describe asthma cases in which exercise is the main, and many times the only trigger for an asthma attack. If a person already has a form of asthma or they are atopic there is more of a chance of getting EIA. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Nocturnal asthma </font> \n\nNocturnal asthma: is the term used to describe asthma cases that get worse at night (nocturnal). \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Premenstrual asthma (PMA): </font> is when asthma symptoms get worse during the premenstrual period. This condition may affect up to 40% of female asthma sufferers. For a diagnosis of PMA to be made it is necessary to have a detailed history of the timing of menstrual cycles along with asthma symptoms experienced, and the peak expiratory flow rate (PMA may cause the PEF to be lowered in the premenstrual period). It is helpful in making a diagnosis to keep a diary of symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Status asthmaticus </font> \n\nStatus asthmaticus is a severe form of asthma in which an asthma attack gets worse as it goes along and the medicines that are usually used to treat asthma do not work. Status asthmaticus can be fatal. \n\nSigns and symptoms in medicine are the way a medical condition affects a person's body. Sometimes the signs and symptoms of asthma may be mild which does not bother the person too much. At other times they may be severe which may make the person feel very sick. \n\nNot every person with asthma has all the signs and symptoms of asthma all the time. A person may have some signs and symptoms during one asthma attack and have different symptoms during another asthma attack. Some people with asthma may have long periods of time between asthma attacks where they show no signs and experience no symptoms of asthma, while others may have some or all of the signs and symptoms everyday which become more severe during an attack. It also depends on what type of asthma a person has and whether they have a mild, moderate or severe case. \n\nThere are also some people with asthma who might only have signs and symptoms during certain times, such as those with exercise induced asthma, where the exercise triggers the symptoms. For some the signs and symptoms of asthma may be triggered or made worse (exacerbated) when they have viral respiratory tract infections, often the type casued by human rhinoviruses. Rosenthal LA, Avila PC, Heymann PW, et. al. Viral respiratory tract infections and asthma: the course ahead. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2010 Jun;125(6):1212-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.04.002. \n\nPMID 20513518 </ref> \n\nEarly warning signs of an asthma attack are physical changes in health that a person with asthma has before they have the attack. By knowing the early warning signs a person may be able to take steps to keep from having an asthma attack or if they do have one, to keep it from getting worse. \n\nEarly warning signs \n\nThe early warning signs of asthma may include: \n\nCoughing a lot, especially at night \n\nLosing your breath easily \n\nShortness of breath: this is when a person cannot take a deep breath which means they cannot fill their lungs all the way with air. They may be only able to take short, shallow breaths which does give their lungs enough air. When a person has shortness of breath they may also have chest tightness. \n\nGetting tired easily during exercise and feeling weak and wheezing or coughing after exercise \n\nFeeling the symptoms of a cold or allergies coming on like sneezing, a runny or stuffed up nose, coughing, sore throat, and headache \n\nA trigger factor or trigger for short, is something that causes the signs and symptoms of a medical condition to begin in a person who already has that medical condition. Common triggers for asthma are: \n\nTobacco smoke: a person does not need to smoke themselves, second-hand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Second-hand smoke is the smoke from the end of a burning cigarette, cigar or pipe that someone else is smoking, or the smoke that they breathe out (exhale). \n\nPets: animals give off chemicals called proteins which are allergens; people can be allergic to them. These allergens can act as irritants and make someone's asthma worse and trigger an asthma attack. The proteins are in the pet's dander which is the dead flakes of skin that animals (and people) shed. They are also in their urine, feces, saliva, and sebum which is made by glands in the skin called sebaceous glands. Sebum is what makes hair and skin oily. When dander, urine, feces, saliva, and sebum dry out their proteins can become airborne and breathed in. Some of the types of pets people can be allergic to are, dogs, cats, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs and pet birds. \n\nBugs: different types of bugs which may be found inside homes may trigger asthma attacks. They may trigger asthma symptoms in the same way as pets; the proteins they give off are allergens and become airborne. Some of the more common bugs which may trigger asthma are dust mites, cockroaches and also bedbugs and fleas. Many other species that may infest a home may serve as a source of allegens such as Pharaoh ants. \n\nFungus spores (mold): fungus reproduce by releasing spores into the air, if the spores land in a good place form them to grow then a new fungus starts. Breathing in these spores can trigger asthma. One of the most common types of fungus spores found in both outside and outside environments are from a group (genus) known as aspergillus. \n\nStrong emotions such as anger, stress and even laughter may worsen asthma symptoms. \n\nOutdoor air pollution can come from many sources such as car and truck fumes in areas of heavy traffic and chemicals in the air near factories and refineries. \n\nWeather: changes in the weather can trigger an asthma attack. Changes in air temperature can trigger an attack not just cold air. If a person goes from being outside in the cold into a warm house the sudden change can cause a broncospasm. Sudden changes in humidity also plays a part. \n\nThe best way to deal with asthma triggers is to learn what they are and avoid them if possible, and if not totally avoidable then adjust one's behavior to deal with them. Example: running on a cold winter day right up to the doorstep of a warm house and going immediately inside; the sudden temperature change can cause an attack and could have been avoided. In general but especially with a medical condition such as asthma it is necessary to be aware of one's environment and what's in it, both indoors and outdoors. Most often the Asthma is triggered by allergens. One big source of allergens is the carpet. Totally replace it with a tiles floor reduce the possibility to create a good environment for the allergens and it is more simple to clean and disinfect. \n\nAn asthma attack is when, after a period of time when aperson has had only a few or no symptoms of asthma, the asthma gets worse all of a sudden, usually because of being exposed to one or more triggers. When the asthma attack happens, the tissue inside the airways swell because of inflammation - which is how the body tries to protect itself from harmful things, like germs and irritants. When the tissues swell the opening (called the lumen) in the airway gets very narrow. \n\nThe smooth muscles (which are the kind of muscles in the body that do not contract voluntarily, like the ones in the arm) around the bronchi and bronchioles begin to spasm or contract which makes the opening in the airway even narrower. This is called a bronchospasm. \n\nInside the lining of the airways are glands called, submucosal glands, and above them, closer to the opening in the airway are cells called goblet cells - because they are shaped kind of like a goblet, which is a type of cup. The submucosal glands and the goblet cells make mucous which helps protect the inside of the airways. The mucous in the airways of healthy lungs is a thin film which traps irritants such as dust particles and pollen so they do not damage the airways and keep them from entering the air sacs (alveoli). \n\nThere are tiny hairs lining the airway called cilia. The cilia wave back and forth like a liitle whips, and help push the mucous and the trapped particles up the airways to the \" pharynx. From there the mucous, the trapped particles from the lower airways can be coughed up (this is called sputum). \n\nDuring an asthma attack the submucosal glands and the goblet cells start making much more mucous than normal, and the mucous is also thicker than normal. This makes it very hard for the cilia to do their job, and bring the mucous up out of the airways. So now there is too much mucous being made, and not enough being brought up by the cilia. The airways are already to narrow to breathe properly because of the tissue swelling caused by inflammation and the constriction caused by the bronchospasms, so the extra mucous blocks the airway even more. This makes breathing very difficult. In fatal asthma attacks the airways can become so constricted and/or plugged with mucous that no air can get through at all. \n\nThere are other signs of breathing difficulty as in an asthma attack, which are important to learn, and knowing them can help tell if someone who cannot talk is having breathing problems. People who may not be able to let somebody know they are having breathing problems include babies and young children. \n\nSome of the other signs of asthma include: \n\n:Chest and neck retractions; which cause muscles within the chest and neck not normally used too much when breathing, to begin contracting as they try and help to take in more air. Retractions are how the body tries to get enough air because of the difficulty in breathing normally because of the asthma attack. These retractions cause the skin of the chest wall, the skin of the neck and or the breastbone (sternum) to move in when breathing. There are different types of retractions which depend on which muscles start contracting, and this depends on how much difficulty a person is having breathing during an attack. \n\n:Nasal flaring is when the opening of the nostrils get larger than normal during breathing. It is often a sign that a person is having difficulty in breathing. \n\n:Blue lips and fingertips: oxygen which is in the air we breathe, is what makes blood have a red color. Blood without oxygen has a blue color. Oxygen enters the body through the air sacs (alveoli) which are at the end of the airways. During an asthma attack it difficult for the body to get enough oxygen because it is difficult to get enough air. As less air with oxygen in it makes it to the air sacs and into the blood, there is less red blood (blood with oxygen in it) and more blue blood (blood without oxygen in it). The blue color of the lips and under the fingernails is because of the blue blood, which can be seen in the small blood vessels under the skin. More parts of the body start turning blue the longer the body goes without oxygen. When parts of the body turn blue because of lack of oxygen it is called cyanosis. \n\n:Sweating : sweating may be noticed especially on the forehead, but the skin does not feel warm, it may feel cool and clammy to touch. \n\n:Rapid breathing (tachypnea); breathing in and out much faster than normal. \n\n:Rapid heart beat: (tachycardia): the heart starts beating much faster than normal. \n\nA diagnosis of asthma is based on a person's: \n\nMedical history; information such as what signs and symptoms of asthma have they had \n\nFamily medical history; has anyone they are related to had asthma or related conditions such as occur with those who are atopic \n\nPhysical examination and testing \n\nDiagnostic Tests \n\nThere is no specific test that can tell if a person has asthma, however there are tests that can help in the diagnosis when the results are considered along with the medical and family history and physical exam \n\nLung function tests [Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)] \n\nSpirometry; measures how much air the lungs are able to breathe in and how much air they breathe out and how fast a person can exhale. \n\nBronchoprovocation test; in this test the airways (bronchi and bronchioles) are provoked (to try and make something happen) into having a bronchospasm (make the airways constrict) this is to see how sensitive they are. Some of the things done to provoke a bronchospasm are making the person exercise, breathing cold air that gets colder, or breathing in a special chemical called methacholine. The results of bronchoprovocation are checked using spirometry. \n\nDifferential diagnoses are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them. \n\nThe differential diagnoses of asthma include: \n\nBronchiectasis \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \n\nAirway remodeling is when there are permanent physical changes to the airways that also affects how they work. This may happen after chronic long-term asthma. After cycles of inflammation, damage and repair to the airways. permanent remodeling of the airways may occur. This is when the physical structure of the airway changes. This will cause permanent airway narrowing (they are always more narrow than normal and get narrower during an asthma attack), bronchospasms are more easily triggered (bronchial hyperresponsivenes), airway edema (fluid in the airway), and mucus hypersecretion (too much mucous is made) as well as the build-up of collagen around the airway which is called fibrosis. Airway remodeling has been observed in chldren as young as six. \n\nNot managing asthma properly can lead to airway remodeling and this can increase the risk of dying from an asthma attack. One of the main problems which cause poor asthma management is not using the asthma inhaler correctly. One of the main reasons for improper inhaler use is the asthma patient not having the proper knowledge in using the inhaler due to not receiving proper instruction. \n\nGoblet cell and submucosal gland hyperplasia: Among the physical changes that may happen in airway remodeling is goblet cell hyperplasia and submucosla gland hyperplasia. Submucosal glands and goblet cells make mucous which helps to protect the airways by trapping harmful particles like dust and pollen. The mucous is normally a thin film which lines the airways. The mucous and whatever particles they trap are brought up to the pharynx by tiny (microscopic) hairs on the inside of the airway that move back and forth called cilia. \n\nDuring an asthma attack the submucosal glands and goblet cells make too much mucous, and it is thicker than normal which makes it harder for the cilia to bring the mucous up. When airway remodeling happens the body may make many more submucosal glands and goblet cells than normal, which means even more mucous is made. There may be too much mucous for the cilia to bring up and the airway may become blocked. This is one of the reasons that people with airway remodeling often have more severe asthma. In fatal cases the airway may have become totally plugged causing asphyxia. \n\nAirway Reconstruction Methods \n\nRegular Breastfeeding sessions are a proven benefit to airway reconstruction. While previous studies have shown a similar effect between breastfeeding and asthma risk, this research is the first that showed a link between the length of breastfeeding and the number of wheezing episodes. Also, this study found evidence that the first asthma-related symptoms occur earlier in life if children were breastfed for shorter lengths of time or not exclusively. The study shows it\u2019s not the nutritional benefit from the liquid, it\u2019s the pull on lung of which dilates the smooth muscles of the air passage. Dry-nursing has actually proven to had been more beneficial in this study for strengthening airway health in both children and adults. Dilating the airways will strengthen them and the lungs themselves. \n\nAsthma can be controlled most often by avoiding contact with triggers and by using certain drugs. Most asthma sufferers carry special medicines around with them. These are called inhalers. The medicine inside the inhaler opens the tubes that go to the lungs. The inhaler is usually used to prevent an asthma attack, or to stop an attack that is already happening. \n\nRescue medicine \u2014 A rescue medicine is an inhaler ( \" puffer \" ) that is used if a person thinks they are having an asthma attack. \n\nController medicine \u2014 A controller medicine is a medicine in either a pill or an inhaler taken every day to prevent asthma attacks. \n\nCommon treatment in a hospital \n\nHospitals have other options they can use in an emergency when the regular treatments don't work: \n\nOxygen \n\nCertain drugs that act like an asthma spray, but are much stronger \n\nCertain drugs that can be given through an IV (intravenously). \n\nSteroids \n\nBreathing aids (including tubes, and valves in very severe cases) \n\nUnconventional Treatments / At Home Remedies \n\nWarm steam baths have often been used to help alleviate nasal congestion and airway irritation associated with asthma. \n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are often used as a natural remedy to help prevent and treat heart disease. Though some research suggests that omega-3s may also help to decrease airway inflammation and boost lung function \n\nThe Buteyko Breathing Technique is based on the premise that raising blood levels of carbon dioxide through shallow breathing can help people with asthma. Carbon dioxide is believed to dilate the smooth muscles of the airways. \n\nHot beverages are known to open breathing passages, have been said to open airways for irritated asthma symptoms. This method has been said to give temporary relief. \n\nHigh consumption of apples may protect against asthma. Daily intake of fruits and vegetables in childhood decreased the risk of asthma. \n\nBreastfeeding or the reflection of in adolescence and adults has been proven to strengthen and promote airway health. The strain from the pull on the lung will dilate the smooth muscles of the airways. Extended therapeutic sessions on a regular basis have been shown to dramatically improve air passage function, and promote less asthma complications. \n\nDrugs that may worsen an asthma attack \n\nThere are certain types of drugs that make asthma worse or that can trigger such an attack. Certain types of drugs should only be used in very specific situations. Some of these drugs are: \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 'NSAID' for short. Aspirin is a NSAID and some people are allergic to it, or may have a higher risk of becoming allergic to it, even if they had used it before. \n\nBeta blockers are a kind of drug used to treat heart problems, but should not be taken by people with asthma. \n\nAcetaminophen is another drug that is believed might help not only to cause asthma, but also make asthma worse in people who already have it. Acetaminophen is an analgesic, a pain reliever. Because of its pain-reliving properties, Acetaminophen is often added to other drugs. Labels should always be read when taking any kind of medicine, including over-the-counter drugs. \n\nACE Inhibitors; are a type of drug usually used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease. They usually don\u2019t make asthma worse, but in rare cases they may cause some of the signs and symptoms of asthma, such as airway obstruction and coughing, especially in the first few weeks of taking ACE Inhibitors. \n\nSleeping pills and trainquilizers; should usually not be taken by people with asthma. \n\nManaging comorbid asthma, depression and/or anxiety \n\nDepression and anxiety have a negative impact on asthma. Comorbid anxiety with asthma is particularly confusing because of the similarity of symptoms and interference in perception and treatment of asthma. The National Asthma Council Australia recommends treatment for comorbid psychological symptoms. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is one recommended treatment for anxiety and depression. There is tentative research evidence suggesting that a program of CBT amended for asthma, delivered in conjunction with medical treatment and in close liaison with your medical team, can improve anxiety, asthma and quality of life. Clinicians intending to deliver CBT for comorbid asthma, anxiety or depression should refer to and the research reviewed by for guidance on safe and effective intervention. \n\nThe Global Initiative for Asthma \n\nThe global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), launched in 1993, is a collaborative effort between the World Health Organisation (WHO), the National Institutes of Health USA (NIH), and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Its aims include; to increase public awareness of asthma, encourage research into the causes for the increasing prevalence of asthma worldwide, encourage research into the links between asthma and environmental factors, improve the effectiveness of asthma management practices, reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with asthma, and make treatments for asthma more readily available. \n\nOne of the ways in which GINA fulfils these aims is by producing medical guidelines on the management of asthma, which based on a systematically conducted review of the most recent-worldwide literature. These guidelines are free and available to all patients and clinicians from the GINA website. The GINA main report is updated annually and aims to reflect evolving best practice as it highlights changes in asthma management strategies. \n\nGINA established \u2018World Asthma Day\u2019 in 1998, with the first event organised in Barcelona, Spain. It is held annually on the first Tuesday of May, and includes the participation of more than 35 countries. \n\nOften, having one medical problem makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric problems. These other disorders are the \" comorbid problems \" or \" comorbidities \" . There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with asthma. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Respiratory disorders </font> \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) \n\nRespiratory infections \n\nChronic sinusitis \n\nRhinitis: allergic (atopic), nonallergic \n\nHyperventilation syndrome \n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a disorder that affects the airways of the lungs which is caused by an allergic hypersensitivity to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Gastrointestinal disorders </font> \n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) \n\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EE) \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Psychiatric disorders </font> \n\nDepression \n\nAnxiety disorders \n\nPanic disorder \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Sleep disorders </font> \n\nObstructive sleep apnea \n\n<font size= \" 3 \"> Skin disorders </font> \n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD): is a type of eczema \n\nIn medicine epidemiology is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to. \n\nIt is more common in developed countries than developing countries.

In Africa the country of South Africa has the highest asthma rate on the whole continent even though it is one of the richest countries. \n\nMore than 80% of the people who die from asthma are usually from low and middle income countries, but not always, as South Africa has the fourth highest death rate in the world even though it is one of the richer countries in the world. In the United States the death rates are higher for females, adults and people of African descent. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: NCHS Data Brief \n\nNumber 94, May 2012; Trends in Asthma Prevalence, Health Care Use, and Mortality in the United States, 2001\u20132010. retrieved on March 3, 2013 Products - Data Briefs - Number 94 - May 2012 </ref> \n\nAs of 2011, 235\u2013300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and approximately 250,000 people die per year from the disease. Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%. \n\nThe amount of asthma cases reported each year has gotten much higher between the 1960s and 2008 Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world. Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and 5% of people in the United Kingdom. Canada, Australia and New Zealand have rates of about 14\u201315%. \n\nHow to Use an Inhaler \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-24T20:02:29Z", "text_length": 39793}

{"title": "Fever", "parsed_text": "A fever is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit). Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity. It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement. For a temperature taken from under the tongue, the measurement may be lower. Rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 C (0.55 F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower. \n\nWhen people are ill, their body's immune system fights the disease, and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises. \n\nAbout 38 \u00b0C (100.4 F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 \u00b0C (103 F) degrees is a high-grade fever. \n\nChildren usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like rabbits and cats, also have a higher normal temperature than humans. \n\nSometimes, high-grade fever can be a medical emergency. At or above 42 \u00b0C (107.6 F) organs start taking damage that may not be repairable. While most fevers are caused by Infection, whether bacterial or viral, some fevers can be caused by cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma. \n\nShands HealthCare article on fever \n\n& sub_cat=107 American Academy of Pediatrics article on home treatment of fevers", "timestamp": "2020-05-18T06:06:55Z", "text_length": 2111}
{"title": "Epilepsy", "parsed_text": "Epilepsy is a chronic condition of the brain. It is characterized by seizures that do not seem to have an obvious cause. To the outside viewer, these seizures show as episodes of heavy shaking. Depending on the seizure, the shaking may be short and difficult to detect or it may be longer. \n\nPeople with epilepsy are sometimes called epileptic, but it is the fit or seizure that is \" epileptic \" . \n\nMany people have died from seizures. \n\nThere are many different forms of seizures, and there are also many different forms of epilepsy. Most forms of epilepsy cannot be cured. In most cases, drugs can make life easier for those suffering from it. In very few cases, (which are difficult to treat), surgery may help. In some cases, only eating special things (called a diet) may help. A special diet has been developed; it is called Ketogenic diet. When it was developed, it was mainly used to treat certain children with epilepsy, before good drugs became available. Today, it is used to treat certain cases where drugs do not seem to help. \n\nCertain forms of the disease disappear after a time, they do for example only occur in childhood. Epilepsy is not one condition. Rather, it stands for a number of health problems that all show in the same ways. \n\nThe condition is very common; about one percent of people worldwide (65 million) have epilepsy. Nearly eighty percent of all cases occur in developing countries. Epilepsy becomes more common as people age. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in infants and the elderly. In the developing world this is in older children and young adults. Between five and ten percent of all people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of eighty. The chance of having a second seizure is between forty and fifty percent. \n\nThe condition has many forms, but generally the following is true: \n\nPeople may get muscular seizures or convulsions. \n\nPeople lose control over their body. Feces may be released in the process. They may fall to the floor and hurt themselves when they are standing or walking. \n\nPeople may become unconscious. \n\nThose affected usually are not aware of the seizure going on. People may not remember or know what happened to them. \n\nIn some cases, people may sense that a seizure is about to occur. This special feeling is called aura. Afterwards, people may remember the aura, but not the seizure itself. \n\nMost seizures only last a short time, the exception to this is called status epilepticus (a long seizure, lasting over five minutes). \n\nReflexes do not work while people are having a seizure; they may also stop breathing. \n\nPeople are tired after a seizure. They may be confused. \n\nPeople who suffer from epilepsy are not mentally ill. \n\nThe condition is very common, and has been studied a lot. There are drugs for many forms of epilepsy that make life better for those affected. Doctors only say someone has epilepsy, if that person has had at least two seizures, for which the immediate cause cannot be seen. There are also seizures which are not caused by epilepsy. \n\nIn most cases, epilepsy is caused by scars in the brain. Some forms of the condition are caused by genetic disorders, which may be passed on from the parents to the children. Very often, the actual cause for an epileptic seizure is lack of sleep, too much alcohol, or other things that cause stress. \n\nMany countries in the world say there are special rules for people who have epilepsy. They need to be without a seizure for some time before they may drive a car. They also need to take drugs to treat their illness. In many countries, such people may not drive buses, taxis or trucks. \n\nPeople having an epileptic seizure face a number of problems. The most common ones are: \n\nThey hurt themselves during the seizure. This includes broken bones, and wounds resulting from biting or hitting an object. \n\nThey produce an accident during the seizure. This includes falling off a ladder, car accidents, and drowning while swimming. \n\nIn some cases, people stop breathing. In such cases, the brain will be damaged, if the seizure lasts for a longer time, or there are multiple such seizures in a row. \n\nDuring the seizure, neurotransmitters are released in the brain. If their concentration is too high, the brain will take damage. \n\nIn many cases, risky behaviour can provoke seizures. Such risk factors include \n\nStress \n\nLack of sleep \n\nAlcohol, and other drugs \n\nIn many cases,a person who is able to cope with stress, who sleeps enough, and who does not drink too much can reduce the risk of having a seizure. \n\n<gallery> \n\nImage:Jacques-Louis_David_017.jpg|Napoleon Bonaparte \n\nImage:Pius ix.jpg|Pope Pius IX \n\nImage:Dostoevsky 1872.jpg|Fjodor Dostoevski \n\nImage:Rudi.jpg|Rudi Dutschke, Student leader \n\nFile:George Gershwin 1937.jpg|George Gershwin \n\n|Vladimir Lenin \n\nFile:Prince by jimieye.jpg|Prince \n\n</gallery> \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-10-24T06:53:55Z", "text_length": 5525}
{"title": "Dementia", "parsed_text": "Dementia is a group of diseases with symptoms, which affect the way people think and interact with each other. It can often be linked to a disease or damage done to the brain. Very often, short-time memory, mind, speech and motor skills are affected. Certain forms of dementia cause a change in the personality of the sufferer. A person suffering from dementia will lose certain skills and knowledge they already had. This is the main difference to other conditions affecting the mind. People who suffer from learning problems, or lower intelligence will never acquire certain skills, people suffering from dementia will lose skills they have acquired. Dementia is more common in older people, but younger people can be affected as well. Certain forms of dementia can be treated, to some extent. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for between 50 and 60 percent of all cases. Other types include vascular dementia and lewy body dementia. \n\nFamous people who suffered from dementia include Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean leader, and also Rosa Parks, the civil rights activist. \n\nPeople who see the following worsen may suffer from dementia: \n\nDecision-making ability \n\nJudgment \n\nOrientation in time and space \n\nProblem solving \n\nVerbal communication \n\nBehavioral changes may include: \n\nEating \n\nDressing (may need assistance) \n\nInterests \n\nRoutine activities (may become unable to perform household tasks) \n\nPersonality (inappropriate responses, lack of emotional control) \n\nSome types dementia are reversible. This means the damage can be undone. Other types are irreversible. This means that they cannot be undone. Irreversible dementia is usually caused by an incurable disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. \n\nReversible causes of dementia also include diffuse axonal injury after injuries to the head or the brain, known medically as Traumatic brain injury. \n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease causes a dementia that gets worse quickly, over weeks or months, and is caused by prions. ,other forms like encephalopathy or delirium may develop relatively slowly, over a number of years. \n\nThe two leading causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and Multi-infarct disease. Glioma related tumors are another kmown cause. Alcohol dementia, is sometimes associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and is caused by long-term or uncontrolled, heavy alcohol abuse. \n\nPossible metabolic causes are such as liver failure or kidney failure; and chronic subdural hematoma. Possible other causes may include brain infection by illnesses like meningitis leading in cases to viral encephalitis drug toxicity (e.g. anticonvulsant drugs).

{"title": "Insomnia", "parsed_text": "Insomnia is when people cannot sleep. A person with this problem is called an insomniac. Insomnia can mean a problem with getting to sleep or a problem with staying asleep. Insomnia is a and not a disease or illness. \n\nThere are at least three different types of insomnia: \n\nTransient Insomnia: this lasts from one night to a few weeks. \n\nAcute Insomnia: lasts from a few weeks to about six months. \n\nChronic Insomnia: lasts for years at a time. \n\nThere are many causes of insomnia. Some of them are: \n\nAs people get older, their sleep patterns change. They will sleep shorter periods of time, but more often. Younger people usually sleep longer. This is normal. \n\nSome insomnias are caused by stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine, cocaine and nicotine. Coffee stimulates the body, and people tend to drink quite a lot of it when they are at work. If they drink too much of it, they will have problems falling asleep in the evening. (The same is true for tea, colas, or any other drink with caffeine in it.) \n\nSome people worry a lot. Their worries during the day will bother them at night. They might have nightmares, or they may wake up sweating. \n\nSome substances, like alcohol can have a bad effect. It can be very hard to sleep after drinking a lot of alcohol. The world may spin and there can be an urge to vomit as soon the person closes their eyes. Drugs can also have this effect, even some \" sleeping \" pills. \n\nA very rare disease called fatal familial insomnia prevents some people from falling asleep. In this disease, a person can no longer sleep and after a while will die from being so tired. It is caused by a protein similar to the one that causes mad cow disease which is a very bad disease that comes from eating infected meat. \n\nPeople with disorders of their circadian rhythms often have trouble sleeping at normal times. \n\nInsomnia is a common symptom of some mental disorders: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dementia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. \n\nThere are drugs available that can help treat the different kinds of insomnia. In some cases, there are also certain herbs that can help.

{"title": "Nightmare", "parsed_text": "A nightmare is a very powerful dream that the sleeper finds disturbing or frightening. Nightmares usually have either physiological causes, like a high fever, or psychological ones, like trauma or stress in the sleeper's life. Nightmares are common, but nightmares that happen very often can cause problems with sleep. They may cause people to get medical help. \n\nNightmares usually happen during REM sleep. \n\nIn earlier times, people thought that such nightmares were really the work of demons. They thought people were having nightmares because an Incubus was sitting on the chest of the sleeper. This can also be seen on the image. Sometimes people also thought magic and demonic possession were involved. \n\nIn the 19th century, people thought their diet was responsible. When Ebenezer Scrooge sees a ghost in A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, he thinks \" ... an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato... \" is responsible. Similarly, the Household Cyclopedia (1881) offers this advice about nightmares: \n\n: \" Great attention is to be paid to regularity and choice of diet. Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine. Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry... Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating... Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night. Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly. Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible. \" \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-01-09T04:52:16Z", "text_length": 2320}
{"title": "Obesity", "parsed_text": "Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for one's height so that one's health is affected. In other words, it means to be too overweight. Also known as being fat. It is considered a disease and has been described as an epidemic. \n\nTo know if a person is overweight, the body mass index (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the person's weight (in kilograms), by their height (in meters) squared (multiplied by itself). (This is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown, and should not be used for children. Growth charts can be used to measure obesity in children.) \n\nA BMI between 18.5 and 25 is considered normal. People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight; with 30 and above, they are considered obese, and with 35 and above, they are considered severely obese (this used to be called morbidly obese). In general, the BMI number is a good quantifiable measurement of a person's obesity. However, it is a poor predictor in people who are very athletic, because a person with a higher than average amount of muscle tissue will weigh more than an average person, thus resulting in a BMI that is higher than normal, even if that person is very large. \n\nThe most common cause for obesity is getting more calories than are used by the body. Other factors that often contribute to obesity are: \n\nPoor nutrition \n\nHormonal problems (for example, caused by hypothyroidism) \n\nProblems with the metabolism, e.g. weight cycling (the so-called yo-yo effect) \n\nEating disorders (for example, binge eating disorder) \n\nPsychological problems, like depression \n\nLack of sleep or sleeping problems \n\nLack of exercise \n\nGenetics are known to contribute to obesity. Leptin is a hormone that is linked to obesity. \n\nMany health problems are associated with obesity. An example is Type 2 diabetes. A woman with a BMI higher than 35 is 93 times more likely to develop diabetes. A 2009 review found that people with a BMI between 40 and 50 were 22.5 times more likely to die from diabetes than people with BMIs between 22.5 and 25. \n\nAn obese woman is more likely to have an unhealthy baby. \n\nRisk is associated with where the excess fat is stored on the body. Abdominal obesity is particularly dangerous. \n\nSome people think that the idea that obesity causes bad health is not completely true and has been exaggerated. An example is J. Eric Oliver. He wrote a book called Fat Politics: The Real Story Behind America's Obesity Epidemic. There is evidence for this belief. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 2003 that 400,000 people died because of being obese in 2000. Then in 2004 they said that the number was wrong. A 2013 review of scientific papers found that Grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-34.9) is not associated with increased deaths. Grades 2 (BMI 35-39.9) and 3 (40+) obesity are associated with much higher rates of death. It has been suggested that obesity is associated with mortality (death) because of mortality in Grade 2 and 3 obesity. People with grade 2 and 3 obesity are 29% more likely to die. \n\n'Metabolically healthy obesity' is increasingly being recognized. Up to 40% of obese people are metabolically healthy. They are not more likely to get heart disease or die than metabolically healthy non-obese people. \n\nThe 'obesity paradox' is a term used to describe how obesity can lower the risk of death. Obesity increases the chance of getting heart disease. But obese people with heart disease are less likely to die in a 7-year period. The obesity paradox has also been found in patients with stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \n\nScientists have not yet found a 'cure' for obesity that most people are willing to implement. It is common wisdom that people who lose weight will regain it all within 5 years. \n\nHowever, this position has been scientifically challenged for over a decade. Additionally, modern research has achieved significantly higher success rates than the figure that dominates the popular internet. Therefore, diet and exercise is the most common recommended treatment for obesity - it has the potential for a very high treatment success rate. \n\nSurgery can be used to treat obesity. Gastric bypass is the most common weight loss surgery. It makes a person's stomach smaller so that they feel full after eating less food and causes their body to absorb less calories. People who have surgery are usually very obese. \n\nSome people think that obesity should not be treated at all. This position is contradicted by substantial medical research. \n\nWeight loss medicines can make people want to eat less or make less of the energy from food be absorbed by their bodies. The only weight loss drug approved by the FDA for long term use is orlistat. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved other drugs because they have side effects. Also they are worried that people who are not obese will take them. \n\nIn the West, people associate obesity with negative characteristics such as laziness, ugliness, stupidity, etc. These attitudes are increasing. Discriminating against someone because of their weight is legal in the United States. The fat acceptance movement says that this is wrong and is a kind of prejudice called fatphobia. In some cultures obesity is viewed as positive. It is associated with wealth, beauty, and fertility. \n\nAbdominal obesity \n\nHypertrophy \n\nHealthy lifestyle \n\nBariatrics (the part of medicine that deals with obesity) \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-05-11T22:18:58Z", "text_length": 6112}
{"title": "Influenza", "parsed_text": "Influenza, better known as the flu and sometimes called the grippe, is a common childhood illness, but is not as common among adults. It is not limited to humans, most mammals and many birds can also catch influenza. It is caused by several different viruses (see: RNA virus), which is why people can have the flu more than once. The name influenza comes from , meaning \" influence \" . \n\nHuman Influenza can pass from one person to another very easily. It is most commonly spread by the microscopic droplets of mucus and fluid that are sent into the air when the sick person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include cough, sore throat, muscle aches and pains, fever, headache, and rarely vomiting and diarrhoea. Influenza can also lead to other diseases, such as pneumonia. This makes it especially dangerous to young children and elderly people. \n\nAlthough there is no cure for influenza, Antiviral drugs can be used to treat the illness so it is not as severe and does not last as long. \n\nThe influenza season runs from late fall to spring because most people catch it in the winter months. When there are more cases of influenza than expected, it will sometimes be called an epidemic. When there are a large number of cases of the same type of influenza all over the world, it is often called a pandemic. \n\nSmall changes that happen as flu is passed from one person to another is the most common way flu viruses change. This is the main reason that people can catch the flu every year. \n\nThe CDC keeps track of the different flu viruses that are circulating, and gives this information to the companies that make flu shots. Since the flu changes so much from year to year, flu shots have to be given for each new flu season. \n\nFlu shots only protect against the most common flu viruses, and every now and then a slightly different type spreads more than expected. Usually when this happens, the existing flu shot gives some protection so that even if a person who had a flu shot catches it, they do not get as sick. \n\nSome flu viruses are caught from animals. Bird flu, for example, is usually only caught by people in contact with sick birds (usually chickens). These types of flu virus are usually very limited, and while they can make a person very ill, usually other people do not catch the virus from the sick person. \n\nAnother way that the flu can change is when a person or animal catches two different flu viruses. The two viruses can exchange some of their genetic information, which can create a brand new flu that nobody has ever caught before. \n\nIf an animal flu virus changes in this way to one that can easily pass from human to human, many people become ill because nobody has any immunity to the new virus. Often, a brand new virus is more severe and kills more people. \n\nNew types of flu virus are usually what causes pandemics, and that is the reason many scientists have been following Bird Flu so closely\u2014it kills six people out of every ten who catch it. This would be a very serious problem if it changes enough to spread easily between people. \n\nThis new flu virus got its name because it contains genetic parts that are commonly found in flu viruses that infect pigs. It is not spread by pigs or by eating pork\u2014this is a new human virus being spread by humans. \n\nAlthough information is still coming out about swine flu, so far it does not seem to be as severe as bird flu or the flu that caused the influenza pandemic of 1918 (also known as Spanish flu), but it is much too early to predict whether it will cause the next flu pandemic. \n\nCDC info on influenza \n\nWorld Health Organization Fact Sheet Overview of influenza. \n\n& sectionId=1725 NHS Direct Health encyclopedia entry \n\nBoth overview and technical details on influenza viruses with emphasis on the potential H5N1 pandemic Includes details of various nonhuman influenza viruses.

{"title": "Dyslexia", "parsed_text": "Dyslexia is a learning disability, a condition that makes it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. It is a very common problem and has an effect on the way our brain understands words. The most common signs of dyslexia are reading and writing problems. Estimates are that in the United States between 5 and 9% of school children have dyslexia, though estimates go as high as 50%. Learning Disabilities: Multidisciplinary Research Centers, NIH Guide, Volume 23, Number 37, October 21, 1994, Full Text HD-95-005 ( \" LDRC longitudinal, epidemiological studies show that RD (dyslexia) \n\naffect at least 10 million children, or approximately 1 child in 5. \" ) </ref> \n\nA person can have dyslexia even if he or she is very smart or educated. Recent studies show there are many small business owners that have dyslexia; between 35 and 50 percent of U.S. and British entrepreneurs are affected. Researchers think many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities (of writing letters) and still be good at speaking. \n\nAt the end of the 19th century , scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic. A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died. He found that some parts of the brain were not connected very well, and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy. This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain. The newest research shows that three genes are the reason for dyslexia. \n\nOne thing that causes dyslexia is a problem with the central hearing nerve. This problem can not be found with a normal hearing test, so a special doctor has to do special tests to find it. It means that people with heavy dyslexia are sensitive to loud noise, may have problems speaking, and may not be able to concentrate. It may also cause problems with rhythm and melody of music. \n\nMany people who have dyslexia also have other mental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. \n\nIn order to tell if a child has dyslexia, he or she has to be seen by a doctor. A child can be called dyslexic if he or she cannot read or write well and there is no other reason for the problem. Doctors are trying to create early tests to help find out whether a child has dyslexia before they are old enough to go to school. If this happens, a child can start to be treated very early, and they may have fewer problems at school. Many well-known people have dyslexia, including: Stephen Hawking , Jamie Oliver, Whoopi Goldberg, Ozzy Osbourne, Jay Leno, John de Lancie, Keira Knightley, Susan Hampshire, Orlando Bloom, Keanu Reeves, Richard Branson, Henry Winkler, Patrick Dempsey, Albert Einstein, and Tom Cruise. These people though continue to thrive with their work. \n\nChildren with dyslexia can be helped. One way teachers help dyslexic students is to break words into different sounds. The student must learn how to write the different sounds and create words. This helps with reading and writing. Some people think that dyslexic children can read and write better if they put pieces of colored paper on top of what they are reading. \n\nDysgraphia", "timestamp": "2020-06-18T07:15:44Z", "text_length": 3598}

Typically, they will do this at least once a week or more often. Bulimic people often think about how their bodies look, and usually, the motive behind purging is the want to be skinny. The person may also have anorexia nervosa. However, most with bulimia have a normal weight or are overweight, which makes it difficult to know when someone has bulimia from just simply looking at them. It is also common to have calluses or bruising on the fingers from purging. \n\nBulimia nervosa can cause many health problems. Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body. Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt. The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems. \n\nSometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing. This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles. There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact. \n\nMost people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25.

Usually people have to be awake and conscious to have hallucinations. That way, a person who sees or hears something that is not really there has a hallucination. Hallucinations are different from dreams. When people dream they are not awake. Hallucinations are also different from illusions. Illusions are based on real perceptions, which are distorted or interpreted in a wrong way. \n\nCertain drugs can cause hallucinations. Some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations. Certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations. In some cases, withdrawal of a drug can also cause hallucinations. This has especially been reported by people trying to stop taking sleeping pills, or by alcoholics. \n\nPeople who have hallucinations are not necessarily ill, lack of sleep can also cause hallucinations. Hallucinations just before going to sleep or just after waking up are considered normal. \n\nHallucinations can affect all of a person's senses. People with the mental illness of schizophrenia may hear sounds or voices that are not really there. People with certain mental illnesses may also have hallucinations in which they see a person or thing which is not really there. People are less likely to have hallucinations in which they smell or touch something that is not really there. Certain forms of epilepsy can cause hallucinations. Finally, hallucinations can be the result of certain substances taken or of certain physical constellations. Most of the time, these substances are taken to get the hallucinations. Sometimes, (severe) lack of sleep, or high fever can lead to hallucinations brought on by such viruses as the common cold. \n\nMany studies have shown hallucinatory experiences take place across the world. Several studies, one of them done as early as 1894, have reported that approximately 10% of the population experience hallucinations. A recent survey of over 13,000 people reported a much higher figure. According to the study, almost 39% of the people reported hallucinatory experiences. 27% of the people reported daytime hallucinations, mostly outside the context of illness or drug use. From this survey, hallucinations affecting smell or taste seem the most common in the general population. \n\nSome diseases such as brain disorders or infections may cause a person to have hallucinations. As well, an alcoholic (person who is addicted to alcohol) who stops drinking alcohol suddenly may experience a type of hallucinations called delirium tremens (or \" DT's \" ). Some people have hallucinations if they do not sleep for a number of days, or if they do not eat for a number of days. \n\nSome people have hallucinations because they purposefully or accidentally put chemicals or drugs into their bodies. \n\nSome people use illegal drugs that cause vivid hallucinations, such as LSD ( \" acid \" ) and PCP ( \" angel dust \" ). Many kinds of drugs - even legal ones - will cause hallucinations, if very large doses are taken, and it is seen as a side effect. \n\nSome legal drugs that dentists, doctors, or surgeons use cause hallucinations. The dentists, doctors, and surgeons use drugs called anaesthetics to make people not feel pain, or to make people become unconscious. But the drugs also have some other additional effects, which are called side effects, such as nausea (feeling sick) and hallucinations. \n\nMany dentists use an anaesthetic called nitrous oxide ( \" laughing gas \" ). Inhaling large quantities of nitrous oxide can cause people to have hallucinations. Doctors and surgeons use many types of anaesthetic gases so that patients who are being operated become unconscious. When a person inhales anaesthetic gases, they may have hallucinations for several minutes, until they become unconscious. \n\nSome adults accidentally swallow a poisonous chemical because it is in a bottle that has the wrong label. In some cases, children swallow a poisonous chemical because they think that it is a food product or a drink. Some dangerous, poisonous chemicals which can make people very sick or even kill them also cause hallucinations. \n\nSome people have hallucinations when they have not slept for a long time; other people have something resembling a hallucination before falling asleep. This is usually called hypnagogia. Most of the time, the people experiencing this kind of hallucinations are aware of the fact that they are not real. \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-08-31T02:56:47Z", "text_length": 5069}
{"title": "Paranoia", "parsed_text": "Paranoia is a mental health condition that affects a person's thoughts. A person with paranoia is called paranoid. Paranoia is a thought process heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion. \n\nA paranoid person's thinking is shaped by fear and anxiety. For example, the person may fear that other people are \" out to get them \" or are planning to hurt them. They may believe that video cameras are watching them, or that a certain group (like the police or CIA) is following them. They may also believe that other people can control their thoughts or use magic to hurt them. Even if these fears seem strange or absurd to others, they feel very real to the person with paranoia. They truly believe that they are in danger. \n\nParanoia is different from phobias. In a phobia, someone has an irrational fear, but does not blame anyone for this fear. A paranoid person will often make false accusations and say that something was intentional, when it was just coincidence or an accident. \n\nIf a person is truly paranoid, their fears must not be explained by common beliefs, like their religion. For example, some religions say that people can use magic to hurt others. So a person from one of those religions should not be diagnosed as paranoid just because he/she has this belief. They would also have to have other paranoid beliefs - which could not be explained by religious beliefs - to be diagnosed with paranoia. \n\nVery often, people with paranoia also have other thought disorders, or mood disorders. Paranoia can be a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses. \n\nIn everyday talk, people may use \" paranoid \" to mean more normal worries. For example, someone may call a friend paranoid for thinking that his teacher hates him. \n\nFor example Nimra", "timestamp": "2020-03-28T21:09:10Z", "text_length": 2037}
{"title": "Delusion", "parsed_text": "A delusion is a false belief held by a person. If doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease, usually a disease of the mind, such as paranoia, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but not always neccesarily, delusions can come in many different forms such as political differences, economic differences such as a god complex upheld by someone who believes they are all powerful and many other types. \n\nDelusions also have other properties, according to Karl Jaspers: \n\nThey can not change (that is they are fixed) \n\nThose holding the belief are absolutely certain of its truth. \n\nThe beliefs may be implausible or bizarre. \n\nStudies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief. \n\nDelusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not. \n\nA doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false, because it seems to be unlikely or bizarre.Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person\u2019s claims; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness. Only after the Watergate scandal was she proved right, and sane. \n\nTreating delusions is difficult, but in some cases antypsychotics can be used. If the delusions pose a risk to the health of the patient (if consented) or the health of others, people may also be treated against their will. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-21T17:08:11Z", "text_length": 2107}

(There are more exercises than these, however, these are the most common.) \n\nOne exercise is to create an erection and begin to lose it, then stimulate it again. This exercise is best done alone at first and then with a partner. Thrusting should not be used with a partner until very near the end of treatment. This treatment may take several weeks to fully cure the problem if it is used properly. \n\nAnother treatment involves using the muscle which stops urine. To locate the muscle, simply begin urinating and stop quickly before emptying the bladder. Doing that, will demonstrate how to use the muscle. Then whenever convenient use the muscle. You do not need to be urinating to use the muscle and it is suggested you are not. After a few weeks of both these treatments, the PE will become more like traditional ejaculation and after about one and a half to two and a half months, it should be absolutely normal. \n\n", "timestamp": "2015-11-30T02:00:45Z", "text_length": 1331}

Another possible cause could be an obstruction somewhere along the digestive tract (the path that food travels inside the body).

People suffering from constipation may defecate only once or twice in a week, and their stool is very solid and tough.

To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough. When they do eat, they do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to lose too much weight too quickly. This is very harmful to a person's body. There are various treatments for anorexia. One example is the Maudsley Method. This type of treatment is for patients who are 18 or younger. Two thirds of adolescent anorexia patients are 'recovered' at the end of this treatment. People with anorexia are more likely to die than people with any other mental illness. \n\nDoctors use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to make a medical diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia. \n\n;Signs of anorexia \n\n#People with anorexia do not want to keep a body weight and BMI that is normal for their age and height. \n\n#People with anorexia think that they are fat. They are afraid of gaining weight. \n\n#People with anorexia have low self-esteem because of the shape or weight of their body. Also, they do not think that low body weight is a problem. \n\n#A woman with anorexia might not have their period multiple months in a row (one period is sometimes called a menstrual cycle). They also must make sure the woman is not pregnant and has not had their periods stop permanently due to their age, which is called menopause. \n\nRapid, unexplained weight loss \n\nRefusal to maintain a healthy weight \n\nLow self-esteem and distorted self-image \n\nFrequent weighing, \" body-checking \" , or negative comments on appearance \n\nAmenorrhoea, the loss of menstrual periods \n\nLow body temperature \n\nLow pulse, blood sugar and blood pressure \n\nDepression \n\nTotal self-starvation \n\nHeart attack or heart failure \n\nKidney failure \n\nElectrolyte imbalance \n\nMuscle and organ damage (when the body has no fat to live off of, it begins to digest muscle and tissue) \n\nSuicide \n\nThere is no single cause of anorexia. Researchers believe that it is caused by a combination of biological and environmental factors. It has been linked to the media. Many people think that anorexia is caused by wanting to be thin like models in magazines. However, it is not that simple. \n\nPeople who develop anorexia tend to be perfectionistic. They are also more likely to have problems socializing. There has been research about the link between anorexia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder that involves problems with socializing. Another symptom of autism spectrum disorder is OCD, which has also been linked to anorexia. Starvation is known to create antisocial behavior so there needs to be research that compares those traits in anorexics with people who have recovered. \n\nBulimia nervosa", "timestamp": "2019-11-22T20:46:53Z", "text_length": 3420}

There is no cure for it. People who are treated soon after becoming infected have a chance to survive. \n\nThe disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood. The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal. Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries. \n\nThere is no cure for Rabies. There is a vaccine (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it. The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux in 1885. This vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits, and weakened (through drying it). The first person to be vaccinated was Joseph Meister (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog). Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using cell cultures) are more used. \n\nThere is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten. It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten. There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late. Treatment starts with washing the wound. This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body.

These tests can find out where the thyroid cancer is, how big it is, and how far it has spread. \n\nFine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: A thin needle, guided by an ultrasound, is put through the skin and into the thyroid. A biopsy is done: a sample of cells is taken out (aspirated) and checked for cancer. \n\nUltrasound: If a person has a lump on their thyroid, an ultrasound can measure how big it is. \n\nSurgical biopsy: A surgeon can take out one side of the thyroid, or the whole thyroid, so it can be tested for cancer. (Sometimes, taking out the whole thyroid is also a treatment for thyroid cancer.) \n\nThyroid scan: The patient takes a pill of radioactive iodine. (It is radioactive so the iodine can be seen on the test. The thyroid is supposed to be able to make iodine into thyroid hormones, so if the thyroid cannot do this because of cancer, the test will show it.) A special camera is used to get an image of the thyroid on a computer screen. This test is not used very often, since it is only useful in certain cases. \n\n2000: 28-year-old Colombian-American actress and model Sof\u00eda Vergara was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She had her thyroid removed, underwent radioiodine therapy, and made a full recovery. \n\n2012: 27-year-old Russian singer and actress, former part of world-wide famous duo t.A.T.u, was diagnosed with stage I papillary thyroid cancer. She developed some thyroid problems after giving birth to her son Samir in 2007 and she do ultrasounds few times a year ever since to prevent serious health problems and eventually was diagnosed with early stage of cancer when her son was 4. She underwent surgery to the tumor, her thyroid was removed too. She later underwent hormonies treatment. Doctors damaged her voice nerve during the surgery and she lost her voice. She underwent multiple courses of treatments in Russia, Israel and Germany to get her voice back during the next year. She later was able to got her voice back in Korea. As of early April 2016 she was cancer-free. \n\n2013: Famous movie critic Roger Ebert died after suffering from the disease for nearly eight years.

{"title": "Phobia", "parsed_text": "A phobia (from the ) is a strong fear about a specific thing or situation. In psychology, phobia is considered an anxiety disorder. Phobia is different than just being scared of something. The fear is so strong that it affects, and often damages, the sufferer's life. For example, the person will usually do everything they can to avoid the thing they fear. If they cannot avoid that thing, they will suffer from very strong anxiety which can damage their social relationships, their ability to work, and other areas of their everyday life. \n\nThere are two basic types of phobias: specific phobias and social phobias. People with specific phobias fear a certain thing, for example spiders (this is called arachnophobia) or high places (acrophobia). People with social phobias fear social situations (for example speaking in public, being in crowded areas, or being around other people). \n\nFear is a normal human emotion. A phobia is different from normal fear in many ways: \n\n#With phobias, a person fears something which is not really dangerous, or which is not anywhere near as dangerous as the person believes it is. For example, many humans fear spiders. However, a person with a phobia of spiders might panic when even thinking about a spider, refuse to leave home because they are too afraid of seeing a spider, or spend hours of each day making sure there are no spiders in their home. People with phobias realize that their anxiety is much more severe than normal fear would be. \n\n#Phobia lasts much longer than regular fear. For example, a person with a phobia of spiders might continue to feel severe anxiety for hours after seeing a spider. \n\n#When a person feels normal fear, their fear does not damage their life. Phobias cause problems in sufferers' daily lives. For example, they may damage important relationships or make it difficult for the person to work. People with social phobias may avoid being with other people or meeting new people. \n\nIt is hard to tell how many people suffer from phobias. Researchers think that between 5 and 13 percent of people seem to have a phobia. Women suffer from phobias about twice as often as men. \n\nEvery child is afraid of something. For most children, these fears eventually disappear. \n\nNormal fears in children include: \n\n0\u20132 years - loud noises; strange people; being away from their parents \n\n3\u20136 years - imaginary things, for example ghosts and monsters; the dark; strange sounds \n\n7\u201316 years - more realistic fears, for example school performance, injury, illness, death, and disaster \n\nThese fears would only be called phobias if they caused problems in the child's daily life, or if they caused the child to suffer from severe anxiety or emotional distress. \n\nCauses and risk factors phobias is very. \n\nIt can be caused by: \n\nphobia occurs mostly in childhood \n\ninnate fear \n\ntraumatic event (assault, assault witness, injury ...) \n\nhear about the possible danger (someone attacked animal; hear about a natural disaster ...) \n\nfamily influence and culture \n\npsychological personality disorder \n\na characteristic trait persons with a susceptible nature are more prone to phobias \n\nparents' lack of interest \n\ngender women are more prone to phobias \n\nalso psychological phobias.

Specific phobias of animals include Arachnophobia (fear of spiders), Cynophobia (fear of dogs), Entomophobia (fear of insects), Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), and Scoleciphobia (fear of worms) \n\nSociophobia - fear of people and/or social situations \n\nGlossophobia \u2013 fear of speaking in public \n\nWhen a person with a phobia is exposed to their fear (encounters with the stimulus, think of it, sees the object of fear in the picture...) occur at these physical and psychological symptoms. Intensity depends on the degree of fear. \n\nPsychological symptoms are symptoms that take place within a human. These include the: \n\nanxiety up to panic \n\nwant to run away \n\nshaking or tremors \n\nfear that the loss of their control, or to drive crazy \n\nfear of death \n\nfear of loss of consciousness \n\nnervousness, restlessness \n\ndifficulty breathing, shortness of breath \n\nheart beat, increased heart rate \n\nshaking or tremors \n\nmore sweating \n\nmalaise, feeling sick \n\nweakness up to fainting \n\nrush hot or cold \n\ndry mouth \n\npain or spin head \n\na need to go to the toilet \n\nThere are different ways to help people with phobias.

{"title": "Narcolepsy", "parsed_text": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder. It happens when the nervous system does not work properly. People with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep during the daytime, even if they do not want to. Very often, they do not sleep well at night, and during the day they fall asleep uncontrollably. There are two different forms. The classical (more common) form is the one with muscle failure (called cataplexy). There is also a less common form without cataplexy. \n\nNarcolepsy affects the way the nerves work. It is not a mental illness, or caused by psychological problems. It is estimated that between 25 and 50 people, per 100,000 suffer from narcolepsy. Very few cases are reported. \n\nThe first description was given in 1877. Jean-Baptiste G\u00e9lineau, a military doctor, first used the name narcolepsy in 1880. \n\nIn certain countries, people diagnosed with narcolepsy may not drive a car. \n\nThings that people with narcolepsy may experience: \n\nExcessive Daytime Sleepiness: Being very tired during the day even after a full night of sleep. This is the most common symptom of narcolepsy. \n\nCataplexy: Suddenly having a muscle fail them. This can range from a slight weakness, and problems speaking clearly, to completely collapsing. \n\nSleep paralysis: When waking up, people are paralysed (unable to move) for a certain time. The paralysis eventually goes away. \n\nHallucinations, while falling asleep or waking up. \n\nAutomatic behaviour: People continue doing things while they are asleep. Later on they do not remember. \n\nHallucinations, sleep paralysis, and automatic behaviour can also occur in people who are not narcoleptics. This usually happens when people are very tired, and have not slept for a long time. \n\nSome scientists think that narcolepsy is caused by a lack of hypocretin. Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain which wakes people up and regulates sleep. However, It is not yet known for sure what causes it. Quite a few sufferers also have another family member with the disease. This may point to the fact that some of the things that cause the disease may be passed from the parents to the children through genes. \n\nThere are certain drugs that can treat the effects of narcolepsy. They can not treat the cause, since it is unknown. In general those drugs are special kinds of stimulants. General stimulants, like coffee, usually do not help. Some strategies for treatment do not rely on drugs: \n\nAdapting the behaviour to avoid situations that trigger daytime sleep; this is generally known as Coping.

{"title": "Sleep paralysis", "parsed_text": "When people are dreaming, their muscles do not move, even if in their dream they are moving. This is a natural process which prevents that people actually perform the movements they do in their sleep. In general, people are not aware of this inability to move, as it usually stops as soon as they wake up. People suffering from sleep paralysis wake up and find that they are unable to move. This is because the paralysis has not stopped. Usually it lasts for only a few minutes, and people have said they feel a \" presence \" or \" ghost \" during it. \n\nLittle is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis. However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post-synaptic (neurons sending signals to other neurons) inhibition (restraint) of nerves in the pons (back) region of the brain. In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which stops stimulation of the muscles. \n\nHallucinations of ghosts, demons and Out of Body Experiences during sleep paralysis may be caused by a part of the brain called the parietal lobe (top-middle part of the brain), and by neurons known as mirror neurons. \n\nStudies suggest that many people get sleep paralysis at least once in their lives. People who have narcolepsy often get it much more. Many people try to induce sleep paralysis, to have an Out of Body Experience. \n\nSome report that various factors make paralysis and hallucinations happen more. These include: \n\nSleeping on your back \n\nIrregular sleeping schedules; naps, sleeping in, sleep deprivation \n\nIncreased stress \n\nSudden changes of lifestyle or environment \n\nA lucid dream just before it \n\nMedium to long-term imagining of involuntary movements with your eyes closed before sleep. \n\nThere are few treatments available for sleep paralysis. One treatment is called Meditation-Relaxation Therapy. The treatment includes four steps: (1) one should close one's eyes and remind oneself that the experience is not dangerous in any way and common around the world; (2) and that since it is not dangerous one should not be afraid as that will only make the experience worse. (3) One should then focus very strongly on a positive thought or mental image (meditate); (4) and also relax ones muscles and avoid movement. \n\nThe Guardian - The waking nightmare of sleep paralysis \n\nOn the Neuroscience of Sleep Paralysis", "timestamp": "2019-01-28T03:34:51Z", "text_length": 2603}

{"title": "Addiction", "parsed_text": "Addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right. When you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict. People can be addicted to drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and many other things. \n\nWhen somebody is addicted to something, they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to. But taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health. Some people who are addicts need to go to a doctor or hospital to cure the addiction, so they no longer crave (want or need) the drug. \n\nAddiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body. The blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain, and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it; then they want more of that substance. This takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine; but all of them control the consumer. Once under this control, the consumer does not have a completely free will, and listens to the addiction's bidding. \n\nPeople can also be addicted to other things which are not drugs. You may hear people talk about being \" addicted to the Internet \" or \" addicted to chocolate \" or gambling. This means that they get into a habit of enjoying that thing, so if they have to go without it for a while, they miss it a lot. \n\nAddiction is similar to a major disease like chronic heart disease or perhaps diabetes, but addictions are not taken as seriously as these major diseases. Most people believe addiction to be a lifestyle choice, which in fact it is but it is also part of a person's genetics. While some people can do things and control themselves others cannot due to their genetic makeup. There are ways of helping the addict but this takes the admission of a problem and then proper testing to reveal what kind of treatment is needed. \n\nThe American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual\u2019s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.

Variola major kills between 20% and 40% of those who get it. Variola minor kills only about 1%. Many people who survive become blind because of the damage the virus does to the eyes. \n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, between 300 million and 500 million people died of this disease. Even in 1967, about 15 million people caught the disease, and about two million people died of it, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \n\nThe first vaccine for smallpox used the results of cowpox infections. It was invented by Edward Jenner. It was used to stop people from getting smallpox. The word \" vaccine \" came from \" vaccina \" , the Latin word for cow, because cowpox was used. The WHO (World Health Organisation) said that they were trying to eradicate (completely destroy) smallpox in 1963. They vaccinated people all over the world. In 1980, the WHO said the disease no longer existed, and no one would ever get sick from it again. However, live copies of smallpox are kept in different maximum-security laboratories around the world. \n\nSome people believe that smallpox could be used as an agent for purposely infecting enemies in a war.

{"title": "Psychosis", "parsed_text": "Psychosis is the name used in psychiatry for a number of conditions. People who suffer from psychosis are said to be psychotic. Usually, psychotic people lose touch with reality, they have trouble telling what is real and what is not. It is an extreme kind of altered state of consciousness. \n\nThe word psychosis has two parts. The first part comes from psyche, which means soul in Ancient Greek. The second part is the ending '-osis', which means illness or unnatural condition. So literally, psychosis means unnatural condition of the soul. \n\nPeople with psychosis may have hallucinations, which means they can experience things that are not really there. They may also have delusions, which are fixed beliefs and ideas that are usually false. Sometimes their personality changes, and they cannot think straight. Some of these thoughts may be paranoid. Not every psychotic person has all of these problems. \n\nBecause of these, psychotics often act in strange ways, which also makes it difficult for them to live a normal life as part of society. They often have trouble with making friends, as most people do not understand them. \n\nPsychosis can affect people to different levels. Some people can continue with mostly normal lives, while other people will need medical help. \n\nAbout 1 percent of people suffer from psychosis during their lives. \n\nThere are many things that can make someone seem psychotic. These include poisons, drugs, diseases of the nervous system, and other illnesses. For this reason, some people use the image of a fever of the central nervous system to talk about psychosis - a serious illness that may not have a very detailed explanation. \n\nMany people have gone through unusual experiences that they believe are real. Hallucinations connected to religion or paranormal experiences seem to be quite common. Very often, these experiences cannot be called psychosis in a medical sense of the word. For this reason, some people have said that psychosis may simply be an extreme case of something that is experienced by most. People who have suffered from what could be called psychosis may simply have had experiences that were very strong or distressing. \n\nIn movies and the media in general, certain people who are shown as violent and antisocial are sometimes labelled psychotic. This image of psychosis is wrong, the people shown are usually psychopaths or sociopaths, they usually do not have hallucinations or delusions. \n\nPsychosis is most associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction and brain damage but it can be caused by a wide range of conditions. \n\nPsychosis is not a disease but rather a name for a number of symptoms, that can be caused by different diseases and conditions. Very broadly speaking there are two types of causes for psychosis: \n\n#In some cases, psychosis can be directly linked to a cause. Some of the causes are: \n\n#Damage to the brain, tumors. \n\n#Wrongly using (or abusing) certain drugs; for example amphetamines, cocaine or alcohol \n\n#severe psychosocial stress \n\n#Lack of sleep This is not a problem for most people, as they will only experience hallucinations shortly before going to sleep or shortly after waking up, which is considered normal. \n\n#certain forms of epilepsy \n\n#exposure to some traumatic event (violent death, terrorist activity, etc.) \n\n#Certain drugs that are taken cannot simply be stopped from one day to the next, stopping them needs to be done in a certain way, usually assisted by a doctor. If this is not done the right way, psychosis can result. \n\n#Various mental illnesses (Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, clinical depression are among them) \n\n#Different other diseases (syphilis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AIDS, malaria, and leprosy are among them) \n\n#There are certain cases of people who suffer from psychosis, where no cause for the psychosis is clear. In these cases, the causes are usually not known. Current research suggests that some of these psychoses may be linked to genetic factors, or due to certain events during the pregnancy of the mother, or the early childhood of the person suffering from psychosis. The first episode of psychosis may be triggered by stress. \n\nMost psychoses can be treated, so that those suffering from them can lead a normal life. The treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis. In general, there are two different forms of treatment available: \n\nThere is a class of drugs called antipsychotics. These usually work by changing the way the brain and nervous system react to neurotransmitters. \n\nThere is therapy for psychotic people. This works by teaching them to recognise when they have an episode of psychosis, and to react to it in certain ways. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-22T14:26:02Z", "text_length": 5123}
{"title": "Cowpox", "parsed_text": "Cowpox is a disease. This disease affects the skin. It is caused by a virus (Cowpox virus) that is related to the Vaccinia virus. People (or animals) who have the disease have red blisters. The disease can be spread by touch from cows to humans. The virus that causes cowpox was used to perform the first successful vaccination against another disease. The disease vaccinated against was the deadly smallpox. Smallpox is caused by the related variola virus. Therefore, the word \" vaccination \" has the Latin root vaca meaning cow. \n\nIn 1798, the English physician Edward Jenner made a curious observation. Jenner lived in the countryside, not in the city. \n\nSome of his patients had gotten cowpox, and recovered from it. He observed that those patients did not get the disease again, they seemed to be immune against it. What was more, they also seemed to be immune against smallpox. Smallpox was a deadly disease then, that killed most of the people it infected. So he used the fluid he got from cowpox lesions, and scratched it into healthy people. That way, he could make those people immune against smallpox. \n\nThe Cowpox (Catpox) virus is found in Europe and mainly in the UK. Human cases are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats. The virus is not commonly found in cows; the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles. It is from these rodents that domestic cats get the virus. Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face, neck, forelimbs, and paws, and less commonly upper respiratory tract infection. Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized, pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction. The incubation period (the time between an infection and the first signs of the disease) is 9\u201310 days. The virus can be found mostly in late summer and autumn. \n\nCowpox was the original vaccine of sorts for smallpox. After infection with the disease, the body (usually) gains the ability recognise the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and so is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently. \n\nLater, and still today, another vaccine was used: vaccinia. Vaccinia is similar to cowpox, but not the same. \n\nChickenpox \n\nList of diseases \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-05-09T20:54:41Z", "text_length": 2415}

At some point, the blisters will drain, and the person will want to scratch them. Burst blisters usually become healthy without leaving scars, unless they become infected. The symptoms come in two or three waves, and they usually include fever. If there are no complications, the disease will last between three and five days in children. Chickenpox is very common and by the age 14, more than 90% of children will have had the disease. \n\nGetting chickenpox during a pregnancy is dangerous, as it can hurt both the mother and the child. \n\nChickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family. People who had chickenpox in the past can also get a related disease called shingles later. Shingles are caused by the same virus but usually is only one part of the body. \n\nThere is a vaccine against chickenpox. Usually, the vaccine is given to children if they did not have the disease before the start of puberty, that is aged 9\u201313 years old.

{"title": "Miscarriage", "parsed_text": "A miscarriage is the natural death of an embryo or fetus in the womb, before it is old enough to live on its own, outside the mother. The medical words for a miscarriage are spontaneous abortion. ( \" Spontaneous \" means something that a person did not expect to happen. An \" abortion \" is when a pregnancy ends early, before birth.) \n\nAmong women who know they are pregnant, about 15-20% have miscarriages. (This means that up to 1 in every 5 women who know they are pregnant miscarries.) It is the most common complication (serious problem) that happens in early pregnancy in humans. \n\nIn the United States, if a fetus dies after it is 20 weeks old, its death is no longer called a miscarriage. Its death is called a stillbirth, a fetal demise, or a fetal death. ( \" Demise \" means \" death. \" ) \n\nBut different countries have different ways of defining the difference between a miscarriage and a fetal death. For example: \n\nIn This Country: \n\nMiscarriage Is: \n\nFetal Death Is: \n\nNorway Death of a fetus under 16 weeks old Death of a fetus over 16 weeks old \n\nAustralia Death of a fetus under 20 weeks old Death of a fetus over 20 weeks old \n\nUnited Kingdom Death of a fetus under 24 weeks old Death of a fetus over 24 weeks old \n\nItaly Death of a fetus under 26 weeks old Death of a fetus over 26 weeks old \n\nSpain Death of a fetus under 26 weeks old Death of a fetus over 26 weeks old \n\nNobody knows all of the reasons why a woman may miscarry. However, some common causes include: \n\nGenetic problems, like aneuploidy \n\nProblems with the mother's uterus or hormones \n\nAn infection somewhere in the mother's reproductive system \n\nTissue rejection (where the mother's body reacts to the fetus like it is something that does not belong in her body) \n\nSerious physical trauma (injury, like a bad car accident \n\nVery rarely, medical procedures that are used to diagnose problems with the fetus can cause miscarriage. This happens in only about 1% of cases (1 out of 100) when a woman has had chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis) \n\nThe most common causes of miscarriage change depending on what trimester the mother is in. (Each trimester lasts about three months.) \n\nMost miscarriages happen during the first trimester. Some studies say that two-thirds (two out of three) to three-quarters (three out of four) of all miscarriages happen during this trimester. About 30% to 40% (3 to 4 in every 10) of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before a woman knows she is pregnant. \n\nIn more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, the embryo has chromosomes that are not normal. These chromosomal problems may happen because of problems as the embryo grows and its cells make copies of themselves. It is also possible for chromosomal problems to happen because of a problem with a parent's genes. However, this is more likely to happen in women who has had other miscarriages, or if one of the parents has a child or other relatives with birth defects. Genetic problems are more likely to happen with older parents; this may be why miscarriages are more common in older women. \n\nAnother cause may be the mother not having enough progesterone. If a woman is diagnosed with low progesterone levels in the second half of her menstrual cycle (the luteal phase), she may be prescribed progesterone, to take during the first trimester of her pregnancy. However, when a woman might already be miscarrying, there is no evidence that first-trimester progesterone pills decrease the risk of having a miscarriage. Scientists have even questioned whether problems with the luteal phase really can cause miscarriages. \n\nCommon causes of miscarriage during the second trimester are: \n\nUterine malformation (when the mother's uterus is not shaped normally) \n\nGrowths in the mother's uterus (these are called fibroids) \n\nProblems with the mother's cervix \n\nThese problems can also cause premature birth (when a baby is born earlier than expected). \n\nOne study found that 19% of second trimester miscarriages were caused by problems with the umbilical cord. The fetus gets blood and oxygen through the umbilical cord. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. If the baby cannot get enough oxygen because of a problem with the cord, it can die. \n\nProblems with the placenta may also cause second-trimester miscarriages. Nutrients and blood pass through the placenta in order to get from the mother to the umbilical cord. The placenta also helps filter out some things that could hurt the fetus. If there is a problem with the placenta, the fetus could die because it did not get enough nutrients and oxygen, or because the placenta did not filter out harmful things. \n\nMiscarriage is usually diagnosed when a pregnant woman notices that she is having certain symptoms and goes to see a doctor. The most common symptom of a coming miscarriage is bleeding during early pregnancy. The woman may not have any pain. \n\nUsually, if a pregnant woman is bleeding or having pain, an ultrasound should be done. The ultrasound can show that the fetus's heart is not beating, which means that the fetus has miscarried. If this happens, special tests should be done to make sure the woman does not have an ectopic pregnancy, which can kill a woman. \n\nNot all light bleeding during early pregnancy means a woman is having a miscarriage. But any woman having light bleeding during pregnancy should see her doctor. If the bleeding is heavy, the woman is having a lot of pain, or she has a fever, she should go to an Emergency Room or call an ambulance to take her to the hospital. \n\nIf a woman has bleeding during her pregnancy, she may be diagnosed with a \" threatened miscarriage. \" In the past, if a doctor thought a pregnancy might miscarry in the future, they would suggest bed rest for the mother (lying in bed for most of the time). Today, most doctors and scientists think that bed rest does not help. \n\nThere are a few different types of miscarriage: \n\nIn a complete miscarriage, the fetus has totally left the mother's body. So has the placenta. There are no pieces of fetal or placental tissue left in the uterus. \n\nIn a missed miscarriage, the fetus has miscarried, but is still inside the mother's body. This often happens when the mother does not realize she had a miscarriage (which is common when the pregnancy is very early on). \n\nIn an incomplete miscarriage, parts of the fetus or the placenta are still in the uterus. \n\nThe treatment is different for each kind of miscarriage. \n\nIf a woman has a complete miscarriage, she usually does not need any medical treatment. \n\nIf a woman has an incomplete miscarriage or a missed miscarriage, there are three different choices for treatment: \n\nWatchful Waiting means that a doctor will keep checking on the woman, but will not give any treatment unless a problem happens. With watchful waiting, most of these miscarriages will pass naturally in two to six weeks. This means that the tissue left in the woman will leave her body, through the vagina, without any treatment. \n\nWith no treatment (watchful waiting), most of these cases (65\u201380%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks. This path avoids the side effects and complications possible from medications and surgery, but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. \n\nMedical Management means that medicine is given. Usually, a medicine called misoprostol is given. Misoprostol makes the uterus contract (get tighter) to push out whatever is inside. In about 95% of cases (95 out of 100), the fetal or placental tissue that is left in the uterus will leave the woman's body within a few days. \n\nSurgery is the fastest way to complete a miscarriage. It also makes bleeding less heavy and makes it not last as long. Also, the woman will not have to go through the physical pain of the miscarriage. Most often, one of two surgeries is used to complete the miscarriage: \n\n:Vacuum aspiration, sometimes called dilation and evacuation (D & E). In a D & E, a tube attached to a pump sucks the tissue left in the uterus out through the cervix. \n\n:Dilation and curettage (D & C). In a D & C, the cervix is widened, and the tissue left in the uterus is scraped and scooped out ( \" curettage \" ). Compared to giving medications, D & C has a higher risk of causing problems. For example, the cervix or uterus may be injured. Because of this, some women prefer not to have a D & C because they want to have children in the future and want to lower the chances of problems during future pregnancies. However, if a woman has had more than one miscarriage, D & C is the most convenient way to get tissue samples, which can be studied to see if a reason for the miscarriages can be found. \n\nThe choice of which treatment to use depends on many things, including what the mother wants. However, there are guidelines that doctors use to suggest what treatment to use. \n\nMissed Miscarriage \n\nThe most important things that help doctors decide what to do are the age and size of the embryo, and the size of the gestational sac (the fluid around the embryo]]. \n\nFor embryos that were less than 7 weeks old, and the smallest gestational sacs, watchful waiting is the best choice, because the embryo will often leave the mother's body naturally. \n\nFor embryos that were 7-9 weeks old with larger sizes and gestational sacs, medicine is suggested, but either watchful waiting or surgery might be used depending on the situation. \n\nFor the embryos that were over 9 weeks old, with the largest gestational sacs, surgery is suggested because the mother is likely to have a lot of pain and bleeding when she miscarries. \n\nIncomplete Miscarriages \n\nFor an incomplete miscarriage, the size of the tissue left in the uterus is the most important thing that helps doctors decide what to do. Ultrasound is used to find out how large the tissue is. \n\nIf the tissue left is smaller than 15mm (millimeters): Watchful waiting is usually the best choice, because it is likely that the tissue will leave the mother's body on its own. \n\nIf the tissue is between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are suggested. Surgery is chosen only if there is a specific reason why the mother needs it. \n\nIf the tissue is over 35 to 50mm, these things are suggested: \n\n:Giving misoprostol to make the tissue left in the uterus leave the mother's body on its own more quickly. \n\n:Having the mother stay in the hospital to be watched for a few hours or overnight. She should stay until most of the tissue left in her uterus has passed, and she has stopped bleeding. \n\n:If misoprostol has not worked, surgery may be needed. \n\nA risk factor for miscarriage is something that makes a woman more likely to miscarry. There are many risk factors for miscarriage. For example: \n\nThe age of the mother. Women older than age 35 have a higher risk of miscarriage than younger women. At age 35, a woman has about a 20 percent risk. At age 40, the risk is about 40 percent. And at age 45, it's about 80 percent. \n\nMultiple pregnancies (pregnancies with more than one fetus, like twins and triplets).

In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it. \n\nMost cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries. It has known to have been in the US before. There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world. This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria. \n\nIn former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed. \n\nThe symptoms of leprosy are irregular spots and patches on the skin. These are either lighter colored than the surrounding skin, or reddish in color. On those patches, hair will fall out, and they will feel numb to the patient. Nerves will form knots there. \n\nWith the illness progressing the sense of touch will become less and less (until the patient feels completely numb). So called leptomes and ulcers will eat away the skin, the flesh and the organs on the patches. \n\nUsually people do not die of leprosy, but of secondary infections and diseases they get. \n\nFor many years there was a leprosy colony on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai called Kalaupapa.

A cystic fibrosis gene is needed from each parent. The parent might not have cystic fibrosis but still might have the gene. A person with cystic fibrosis is not contagious (they cannot give it to anyone else). There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but there are a lot of medications that help keep people healthy. \n\nCystic fibrosis affects the entire body.

{"title": "Myocardial infarction", "parsed_text": "An acute myocardial infarction, also called a heart attack, happens when a blood vessel in the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Blood vessels carry blood and oxygen. When a blood vessel in the heart gets blocked, blood cannot get to part of the heart. This part of the heart does not get enough oxygen. This is called ischemia. When the heart muscle becomes ischemic (does not get enough blood and oxygen), the ischemia often causes chest pain. This is called Angina Pectoris. If the ischemia lasts long enough, the heart muscle that is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called an infarction. \" Myocardial infarction \" means \" infarction (muscle death) in the heart muscle. \" \n\nA heart attack is a medical emergency. The first few minutes are very important for keeping the person alive. Some of the damage from the heart attack can be repaired if the person gets treatment during the first hour of the attack. \n\nMost heart attacks are caused by Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). In coronary artery disease, a wax-like material called plaque builds up on the inside walls of arteries in the heart. This is called atherosclerosis. Plaque is made of cholesterol and other cells. The amount of plaque increases slowly. As more plaque builds up, the insides of the heart's blood vessels get narrower. This means that less blood can flow through the blood vessels. This can cause platelets (which make the blood clot) to build up in front of the plaque. This causes a blood clot in the blood vessel. If the clot breaks free and gets stuck in part of the blood vessel made narrower by the plaque, the plaque and the clot together block the blood vessel completely. This makes it impossible for blood to get to part of the heart, and causes a heart attack. \n\nA person can lower their chances of getting coronary artery disease by eating healthy foods, exercising, not smoking cigarettes, and not drinking too much alcohol. \n\nSigns that a person is having a heart attack show over several minutes, and rarely come immediately. Most people having a heart attack have chest pain. Sometimes, people also have pain in the left arm, the lower jaw, the neck, the right arm, the back, or in parts of the abdomen. \n\nMany women have different symptoms than men. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath (trouble breathing), weakness, and feeling very tired. Some women feel tired, do not sleep properly, and have shortness of breath for up to a month before they have a heart attack. Women may also have nausea and stomach upset when having a heart attack. \n\nSometimes, people have \" silent heart attacks. \" These are heart attacks that do not cause any pain. They are more common in elderly people, women, and people with diabetes. In these people, suddenly feeling very tired, or fainting, may be the only sign of a heart attack. \n\nA heart attack is a medical emergency that needs treatment as quickly as possible. The most important thing is to save as much myocardium (heart muscle) as possible and prevent more complications. As time passes, the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases. \n\nDoctors or paramedics usually start certain treatments as soon as a heart attack is suspected. These treatments include: \n\nAspirin. Aspirin is an early and important treatment for a heart attack. Aspirin keeps platelets from sticking together, and can help prevent more blood clots from forming inside the blood vessels and the heart. \n\nNitroglycerin (nitro). Nitro widens the blood vessels in the heart. This makes it easier for blood to flow through those vessels to the heart. \n\nOxygen (if needed). If the patient is having trouble breathing, oxygen can be given. \n\nPain medicine for chest pain (if needed). \n\nOnce doctors are sure that a person is having a heart attack, there are two main treatments: \" clot-busting medicines \" (thrombolytics) and percutaneous coronary intervention. \n\n\" Clot-busting medicines \" (called thrombolytics) can dissolve blood clots that are blocking the blood vessels in the heart. This makes it possible for blood and oxygen to flow again to the part of the heart that was not getting enough blood and oxygen. The most common clot-busting medicine is called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). \n\nClot-busters work best if patients get them within 30 minutes after getting to the hospital. However, if a patient gets a clot-busting medicine within 12 hours after the heart attack starts, they have a better chance of surviving. \n\nClot-busting medicines do have some risks. Sometimes they can thin the blood too much and cause bleeding. \n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention is a way of opening blocked coronary arteries. Percutaneous means that the procedure is not done by cutting a person open in surgery. Coronary intervention means \" way to help the heart \" . Percutaneous coronary intervention is also called \" coronary angioplasty \" . \n\nIn a percutaneous coronary intervention, a doctor threads a flexible tube into one of the patient's blood vessels, usually one in the upper thigh. The doctor threads the tube up to the blocked blood vessels in the heart. On the end of the tube is a balloon. The doctor blows up the balloon, which pushes the plaque and blood clot against the side of the blocked blood vessel. This allows blood to flow through that blood vessel again. Sometimes, a doctor might also place a small mesh tube called a stent into the blood vessel. The stent will make sure the blood vessel stays open and does not get blocked again in the future. \n\nAs soon as a person thinks they may be having signs of a heart attack, they should call emergency service right away. (Emergency services can be reached dialling 911 in the US, and 112 in most of continental Europe) However, the average person waits about three hours before asking for help. When a person waits to get help, they are more likely to have more serious damage to their heart. The American Heart Association says \" time is muscle \" : the more time a person waits to get treatment, the more heart muscle dies. \n\nIf a person is having trouble breathing, sitting straight up can help. The person should follow any instructions they get from the emergency operator or their doctor. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-03-03T01:04:53Z", "text_length": 7102}

{"title": "Dehydration", "parsed_text": "Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something. The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, hydor. \n\nPeople get dehydrated when they lose more water than they take in. The human body needs water to survive. If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way. Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death. \n\nA person will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water the body is losing. The most common causes of dehydration are: \n\nSweating a lot (because of hot weather or exercise) \n\nBad diarrhea \n\nVomiting (throwing up) \n\nUrinating more than usual (this can happen if a person has uncontrolled diabetes or takes medicines like diuretics which cause them to urinate more often) \n\nFever \n\nAnyone can get dehydrated. However, some people are more at risk for dehydration. (This means that they get dehydrated more easily than most people.) Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration. \n\nDehydrated people may have different symptoms depending on how dehydrated they are. If dehydration is not treated, it will get worse. As dehydration gets worse, the symptoms get more dangerous. \n\nWhen people start to get dehydrated, they may have these symptoms: \n\nThirst \n\nDry, sticky mouth \n\nFeeling tired or sleepy \n\nNot urinating as much as usual \n\nDry skin \n\nHeadache \n\nConstipation \n\nFeeling dizzy or lightheaded \n\nNo tears come out when the person cries \n\nWhen dehydration gets severe (very bad), its symptoms include: \n\nBeing very thirsty \n\nFeeling irritable and confused (infants and children may be very fussy or get very sleepy) \n\nVery dry mouth and mucous membranes \n\nShriveled, dry skin that is less elastic than normal (it <span> doesn't \" bounce back \" when pinched into a fold) </span> \n\nUrinating very little, with darkly colored urine, or not urinating at all \n\nSunken eyes \n\nIn infants, the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head) may be sunken \n\nLow blood pressure (blood pressure may also drop when the person sits up or stands up, making them feel dizzy or faint; this is called orthostasis) \n\nFast heartbeat (tachycardia) \n\nFast breathing (tachypnea) \n\nFever \n\nIn the most serious cases, delirium or unconsciousness \n\nSevere dehydration is a medical emergency. If a person with severe dehydration does not get medical treatment soon enough, they can die. \n\nBad dehydration can cause serious health problems. Some of these problems are: \n\nHeat injury. When it is very hot outside, or when a person is exercising a lot, fluids like water help keep the body cool. If the person is dehydrated, their body can overheat (it gets too hot and cannot cool itself down). This can cause heat injury. The mildest (least serious) form of heat injury is heat cramps (cramping, or pain, in the muscles). As heat injury gets worse, it becomes heat exhaustion. If the body keeps overheating and the person does not get medical treatment, heat exhaustion becomes heat stroke. Heat stroke is a very serious medical emergency. People with heat stroke can have damage to their organs and even die if they do not get treatment quickly enough. \n\nSwelling of the brain (cerebral edema). Sometimes the body tries to fix dehydration by pulling a lot of water into its cells. If the body pulls too much water into the cells, those cells can swell and break. If this happens to the cells in the brain, the brain can swell. \n\nSeizures. When a person gets dehydrated, their electrolytes can get out of balance. Electrolytes are important salts in the body which carry electricity. When electrolytes like sodium and potassium get out of balance, the body's electrical signals can get mixed up. This can cause seizures. \n\nShock. Fluid is an important part of human blood. Water makes up most of blood plasma, which carries blood cells and other important things to the entire body. If a person gets very dehydrated, the amount of blood in the body drops. This causes low blood pressure. If a person does not have enough blood and oxygen in their body, they can go into shock. In medicine, this is called hypovolemic shock. \n\nKidney failure. Bad dehydration can hurt the kidneys. When the kidneys are hurt or not working properly, they cannot remove poisons and extra fluid from the blood. \n\nTo fix dehydration, a person has to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they have lost. \n\nWhen dehydration is not too bad, people can usually treat themselves by drinking. This is called oral rehydration therapy. Stores sell special drinks like Pedialyte and Gatorade, which have both water and electrolytes in them. People can also make their own oral rehydration solution (a drink which treats dehydration) by mixing water with sugar and salt. \n\nPeople with very bad dehydration need emergency medical treatment. They may need to get fluids intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). This replaces lost fluids and electrolytes much more quickly than drinking. It is also helpful for people who are unable to drink because of nausea and vomiting from dehydration. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-08-12T07:34:49Z", "text_length": 6201}
{"title": "Down syndrome", "parsed_text": "Down syndrome (or trisomy 21; old name mongoloid idiocy) is a genetic disorder. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it. \n\nDown syndrome causes a mental handicap. It may be mild or severe. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but it truly depends on the person. This can vary widely, but most individuals need supervision if they are to live their lives in a satisfactory way. Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things. \n\nThe condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866. He called it mongoloid idiocy because he thought that children with Down syndrome had faces like that of Blumenbach's Mongolian race. Idiocy meant intellectual disability. People do not use the term \" mongoloid idiocy \" today. It is a rude term. \n\nThere is sometimes discrimination against people with Down syndrome, both in the education system and in society in general. Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead. People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people. A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties. \n\nOf every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome. Older women have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If they have a procedure known as amniocentesis, pregnant mothers can be told whether their foetus has Down syndrome. Sound scans may also diagnose the presence of Down Syndrome. Mothers whose foetus is diagnosed as having Downs syndrome may choose to have an abortion. In the United Kingdom and Europe 92% of such cases are aborted. \n\nThey also grow differently from other children. Babies with down syndrome can be identified at birth because they may have a specific set of physical features. These features include narrow eyes, a flat nose-bridge, smaller mouths and shorter fingers. Smaller mouths can result in tongue protrusion or what looks like a large tongue. Sometimes the little fingers curve inwards as well, and there is also often a space between the big toe and the others. People with Down syndrome often have heart defects or Alzheimer's disease when they are older. About 90% of people with Down syndrome live through their teens. The lifespan of a person with Down syndrome averages between 50 and 55 years old. \n\nSo far there have been no treatments for Down syndrome. \n\nDown syndrome comes from a problem with the genes. Humans are diploid organisms. This means that for each chromosome, there are two copies, one from the mother, and one from the father. During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it. \n\nThere are three ways that Down syndrome is caused. The most common cause of Down syndrome is trisomy. Trisomy is when the child receives two chromosomes from the mother and one from the father. This makes it so there are three chromosomes of chromosome #21. Another way Down syndrome is caused is when new cells are made. Sometimes even when the parent cells are normal chromosome 21 can be deformed when cells reproduce. This makes it so some cells have 47 chromosomes and others have 46. This is called a mosaic disorder. Mosaic means that they have a third chromosome from the replication of cells. The third way Down syndrome can be caused is called translocation. This happens when a normal chromosome breaks into two pieces. This results in three chromosomes. \n\nStephane Ginnsz, actor (Duo)\u2014In 1996 was first actor with Down syndrome in the lead part of a motion picture. \n\nMax Lewis, actor (Notes on a Scandal). \n\nJoey Moss, Edmonton Oilers locker room attendant. \n\nIsabella Pujols, adopted daughter of St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols and inspiration for the Pujols Family Foundation. \n\nPaula Sage, Scottish movie actress and Special Olympics netball athlete.

{"title": "Pneumonia", "parsed_text": "Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system. The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed. They fill up with a fluid, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning. They may also feel pain when they breathe. Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine. \n\nPneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs. Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer, can also result in pneumonia. \n\nPeople with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing. They may also cough, or have pains in the chest area. The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused. If it was caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be used to treat it. \n\nPeople of all ages can have pneumonia. The disease is dangerous. Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people with a weak immune system. \n\nAccording to some research in 2010, in some parts of the world where people are very poor like India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, pneumonia was the cause of death for more children under the age of five than any other disease. Statistically, however, for every 2,000 children in the developing world who die of pneumonia, only one child in the developed world dies from the disease. This is because of differences in health care and because of differences in rates of breastfeeding, not because of differences in children. Breastfeeding newborn babies greatly increases their ability to survive pneumonia, but some cultures think of breastfeeding as taboo. \n\n; Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \n\n:SARS is a highly contagious and deadly type of pneumonia which first occurred in 2002 after initial outbreaks in China. SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a pathogen (disease-causing organism) that was not known until then. New cases of SARS have not been seen since June 2003. \n\n; Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) \n\n:BOOP is caused by inflammation (swelling or irritation) of the small airways of the lungs. It is also known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP). \n\n; Eosinophilic pneumonia \n\n:Eosinophilic pneumonia is invasion of the lung by eosinophils. Eosinophils are a particular kind of white blood cells. Eosinophilic pneumonia often occurs in response to infection with a parasite or after exposure to certain types of environmental factors. \n\n; Chemical pneumonia \n\n:Chemical pneumonia (usually called chemical pneumonitis) is caused by chemical toxins such as pesticides, which may enter the body by inhalation (breathing in) or by skin contact. When the toxic (poisonous or harmful) substance is an oil, the pneumonia may be called lipoid pneumonia. \n\n; Aspiration pneumonia \n\n:Aspiration pneumonia (or aspiration pneumonitis) is caused by accidentally inhaling oral (mouth) or gastric (stomach) contents into the lungs, either while eating, or after reflux or vomiting, and causing damage to the lungs. The lung inflammation from these materials is not an infection but it can eventually cause one, since the material taken into the lungs may contain bacteria. Aspiration is a common cause of death among hospital and nursing home patients, since they sometimes cannot cough hard enough to protect their airways. \n\nMerck Manual: Pneumonia \n\nMerck Manual of Geriatrics: Pneumonia in the elderly \n\nBritish Lung Foundation", "timestamp": "2019-03-17T12:53:41Z", "text_length": 3782}

{"title": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome", "parsed_text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was an atypical pneumonia. It started in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, in the city of Foshan, of the People's Republic of China. The disease was caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a new coronavirus. It was also a part-time STD, it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact. \n\nSARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died. \n\nAfter the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers. The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003. There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%). \n\nIn May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox). The New York Times reported that \" not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004. It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002. Also, the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then. \" \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-04T14:54:17Z", "text_length": 1826}
{"title": "Syphilis", "parsed_text": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. Syphilis is usually spread by sexual contact. However, a fetus can get syphilis from its mother while she is pregnant or during childbirth. This is called congenital syphilis. \n\nThere are four stages of syphilis: the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. In each stage, the signs and symptoms of syphilis are different. \n\nIn the primary stage, a person usually just has a wound on their skin, called a \" chancre. \" In the secondary stage, a person usually gets a rash. In the \" latent \" stage, syphilis has few or no symptoms. If syphilis reaches the tertiary stage, which is the most severe, it causes many serious symptoms. These can include problems with the nervous system (the brain and nerves) and problems with the heart. Eventually, many people with tertiary syphilis will die if they do not get medical treatment. \n\nSyphilis is usually diagnosed with blood tests. The bacteria that causes syphilis can also be seen under a microscope. Most people who have syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics. \n\nBy 1999, more than 12 million people around the world had gotten syphilis. More than 90% of these people (10.8 million) lived in the developing world. Syphilis got much less common after penicillin became available in the 1940s. At that time, penicillin was used as a treatment for syphilis, and often cured the disease. However, since 2000, syphilis is becoming more common again. \n\nSyphilis can be a very dangerous disease if it is not treated. Without treatment, 8% to 58% of people with syphilis die from the disease. Syphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). \n\nAfter a person gets syphilis, the disease begins in the primary stage. A person gets syphilis by having sex with a person who has syphilis. Usually, the person who has syphilis has wounds on their genitals caused by syphilis. Touching these wounds during sex (including oral sex or anal sex) can give a person syphilis. \n\nLater, a chancre (skin sore) usually appears at the place on the body that touched the infected wounds. The chancre can be painful. The most common type of chancre gets bigger and bigger until it becomes an ulcer. \n\nChancres can appear in places other than the genitals. In women, chancres most often appear on the cervix - the bottom of the uterus. Some people get no chancres at all. Many people who have secondary syphilis (40\u201385% of women and 20\u201365% of men) say they never had a chancre during the primary stage. \n\nAround the place where syphilis entered the body, the lymph nodes usually get bigger about 7 to 10 days after the chancre forms. If the person does not get treatment, their wound(s) can last for three to six weeks. \n\nIf a person does not get treatment, syphilis will get worse. The secondary stage of syphilis will start about four to ten weeks after the person first got infected. Secondary syphilis can cause many different symptoms. However, the most common three symptoms are: \n\nSores on the mucous membranes (like the nose, throat, genitals, or anus) \n\nA rash on the chest, back, hands, and/or feet \n\nSwollen lymph nodes \n\nAll of the sores that people get during this stage can spread syphilis. The bacteria lives inside the wounds. \n\nThe symptoms of secondary syphilis usually get better after three to six weeks. However, in about 25% of cases (1 out of every 4), these symptoms can return. \n\nIn the latent stage of syphilis, a person has no symptoms, but blood tests show that he has syphilis. Latent syphilis is described as either early or late. \n\nThe early latent stage: In the United States, latent syphilis is called \" early \" if it has been less than one year since the person had secondary syphilis. In the United Kingdom, latent syphilis is called \" early \" if it has been less than two years. \n\nIn this stage, the symptoms of secondary syphilis can still come back. \n\nThe late latent stage: People enter this stage when it has been more than one year (in the U.S.) or more than two years (in the U.K.) since they had secondary syphilis. \n\nPeople in this stage have no symptoms, and do not spread syphilis as easily as people in the early latent stage. \n\nIf a person with syphilis does not get treatment, the disease can reach the worst stage - tertiary syphilis. Usually this happens about three to 15 years after the person first got infected. Without treatment, one-third of people with syphilis get tertiary disease. People with tertiary syphilis cannot infect other people with syphilis. \n\nThere are three different forms of tertiary syphilis. \n\nGummatous syphilis can happen anywhere from one to 46\u00a0years after the person first got syphilis. On average, it happens after 15 years. It causes soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation (swelling), of many different sizes. Usually they appear on the skin, bone, and liver, but they can happen anywhere. \n\nAbout 15% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get gummatous syphilis. \n\nIn neurosyphilis, the syphilis infects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In some people, neurosyphilis happens soon after they get syphilis. (This is called early neurosyphilis.) Some of these people have no symptoms of neurosyphilis. Others get syphilitic meningitis, a dangerous infection of the meninges (the protective layers which line the brain and spinal cord). \n\nNeurosyphilis can also appear later, usually four to 25 years after a person first got syphilis. (This is called late neurosyphilis.) Late neurosyphilis can cause many serious problems. For example: \n\nMeningovascular syphilis, which causes seizures \n\nGeneral Paresis: In this brain disease, syphilis causes chronic meningoencephalitis - an infection of both the meninges and the brain which does not go away. This causes parts of the brain to die. \n\nBecause of this, the person gets dementia (which causes problems with the way a person thinks, remembers, acts, and behaves toward other people) \n\nThe person also gets tabes dorsalis (which causes problems with balance, and pain in the legs and feet) \n\nAbout 6.5% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get late neurosyphilis. \n\nThis type of tertiary syphilis causes problems with the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood vessels). It usually happens 10 to 30 years after the person first got infected with syphilis. \n\nThe most common problem it causes is syphilitic aortitis, which affects the aorta. The aorta is the most important artery in the heart; it helps carry blood to the entire body. Syphilitic aortitis can make the aorta become too big. If the aorta is too big, it cannot work correctly. \n\nAbout 10% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get cardiovascular syphilis. \n\nCongenital syphilis is spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy or childbirth. \n\nTwo out of every three infants born with syphilis have no symptoms. In the other infants, symptoms can appear as the baby gets older. The most common symptoms are: \n\nHepatosplenomegaly (where two important organs, the liver and spleen, are larger than usual) \n\nRash \n\nFever \n\nNeurosyphilis \n\nSwelling in the lungs \n\nIf babies with syphilis do not get treated, they can get late congenital syphilis, which has much more serious symptoms. For example, the child can have seizures, and their body and brain may not grow normally. \n\nSyphilis is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacterium. Treponema pallidum is a species of bacterium which is shaped like a spiral: a spirochaete. There are different types of Treponema pallidum bacteria, which are called subspecies. \n\nScientists think that Treponema pallidum can only live inside humans. The bacterium cannot survive outside a human for more than a few days. \n\nSyphilis is spread mostly by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus. Syphilis can pass through undamaged mucous membranes, or through damaged skin. Because of this, syphilis can be spread through oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex. It can also be spread by kissing, if the person with syphilis has a sore in their mouth. \n\nOnly a very small amount of the Treponema pallidum bacterium needs to get into a person's body to cause syphilis. However, not everybody who is exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease. \n\nA person can get syphilis if they get a blood transfusion from someone with the disease. However, many countries test blood donations for syphilis. In countries that do not do this, getting syphilis from a blood transfusion is much more likely. \n\nScientists think syphilis is usually not spread by sharing needles (using the same needles to inject drugs). \n\nA person cannot get syphilis from sitting on a toilet seat; using a hot tub or a swimming pool; sharing plates, cups, or utensils; sharing clothing; or doing other regular daily activities. \n\nIt is hard for doctors to diagnose syphilis just from the signs and symptoms that happen early on, because many diseases can cause skin sores and rashes. Instead, they can diagnose syphilis by doing a blood test, or by looking at the blood under a microscope. Blood tests are used more often, because they are easier to do. However, blood tests cannot tell which stage of syphilis a person has. \n\n, there is no vaccine that prevents syphilis. \n\nNot having sexual contact with a person who has syphilis is one of the best ways to prevent getting syphilis. \n\nIf a person does not know if their sexual partner has syphilis, having safer sex can help protect them. For example, using a latex condom the right way lowers the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis. However, even if a person uses a condom, it is still possible for him to get syphilis. \n\nBecause of this, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the best ways to prevent syphilis are: \n\nTo be in a long-term relationship with a partner who does not have syphilis; \n\nFor both partners to be loyal in their relationship and not have sexual contact with anyone else; and \n\nTo avoid using alcohol or other drugs, because they make people more likely to have risky, unsafe sex, which can spread syphilis. \n\nCongenital syphilis in newborn babies can be prevented by testing mothers for syphilis during early pregnancy and treating women who are infected. By following these steps, in 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate the spread of syphilis from Cuban mothers to their babies. \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the World Health Organization say that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis. If a woman tests positive, her sexual partners (the people she has had sex with) should also be treated. \n\nIn most developed countries, congenital syphilis is not common. It still happens once in a while, when women do not get any health care during pregnancy. However, congenital syphilis is much more common in developing countries. Many women in these countries do not get healthcare during pregnancy, and others get healthcare that does not include testing for syphilis. When there are programs that make syphilis testing easier to get, fewer babies get congenital syphilis in these countries. \n\nIf people do certain things, they are more likely to get syphilis. Medical professionals say that these people should get tested regularly. For example, the CDC says that men who have sex with men should be tested at least every year. Getting tested regularly helps prevent syphilis from being spread. If a person is tested and finds out that they have syphilis, they are more likely to get treatment, and will not accidentally spread syphilis to other people. \n\nSyphilis is a notifiable disease in many places, including Canada, the countries in the European Union, and the United States. This means that if a healthcare provider (like a doctor or a nurse) knows that a patient has syphilis, the provider has to tell public health authorities that the patient is infected. Public health workers then talk to all of the patient's sexual partners. They tell them someone might have given them syphilis, without telling them who that person is. Doctors might also try to get patients with syphilis to tell their sexual partners to get treatment. \n\nSyphilis that is not complicated can usually be treated and cured by antibiotic medications. \n\nUsually, people need just one dose of penicillin G or azithromycin. If a person cannot take either of these medicines (for example, because they are allergic to them), some other medications work too. For example, Doxycycline and tetracycline are two other possible choices; however, they cannot be used in pregnant women. \n\nThe Treponema pallidum bacterium has become resistant to many different antibiotics, including macrolides, clindamycin, and rifampin. This means that these antibiotics no longer kill the bacterium. \n\nOnce a person is in the later stages of syphilis, the disease is harder to treat. \n\nFor example, if a person has neurosyphilis, they need antibiotics that will kill the infection in their central nervous system (their brain and major nerves). However, it is hard for penicillin G to get into the central nervous system. Because of this, a single shot of penicillin - which will usually cure early syphilis - is not enough to cure neurosyphilis. Instead, people with neurosyphilis usually need to be given large doses of penicillin for at least 10 days. Usually, they also need to get the medicine intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein) so it goes more directly to the central nervous system. If a person is allergic to penicillin, other antibiotics like ceftriaxone, doxycycline, or tetracycline can be used, but they have to be given over longer periods of time. \n\nOnce a person has late-stage syphilis, treatment will keep their syphilis from getting any worse. However, if syphilis has already damaged the person's body, the treatment will not make that damage go away. At best, treatment can only have a very small effect on the damage that has already happened. \n\nSometimes, the treatment for syphilis can cause a side effect called the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This reaction usually starts within one hour after treatment begins, and lasts for 24 hours. Its symptoms include fever, muscle pains, headache, and a fast heart rate. \n\nAntibiotic medication breaks open syphilis bacteria to kill them. As the bacteria break open, proteins come out of them. These proteins cause the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. \n\nBy 1999, syphilis had infected about 12 million people. More than 90% of these people lived in the developing world. \n\nSyphilis causes problems in 700,000 to 1.6 million pregnancies every year. Syphilis can cause a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, a premature baby, a baby with congenital syphilis, or a baby that dies before it is a month old. In sub-Saharan Africa, syphilis causes up to 20% of perinatal deaths (deaths that happen soon after a baby is born). \n\nSyphilis used to be very common, and it caused sickness and death all over the world. It was especially very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. During the early 20th century, syphilis quickly became less common in the developed world, because antibiotics were being used more and more. Syphilis kept becoming less common until the 1980s and 1990s. Since the year 2000, syphilis is getting more common again in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Europe, mostly among men who have sex with men. \n\nIn China and Russia, syphilis has gotten more common among heterosexual ( \" straight \" ) people since the 1990s. Studies say this is because of unsafe sexual practices, like having sex with many different people, prostitution (getting paid to have sex), and not having safer sex to protect against sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nOver the 19th and 20th centuries, the symptoms of syphilis have become less severe (not quite as bad). This is partly because there are more treatments that work well, and if they are given early, syphilis does not get as bad. Also, the bacteria that causes syphilis has become weaker. \n\nIf people with syphilis get treated early on, they can usually be cured without the disease causing damage that cannot be fixed. However, syphilis is still very dangerous. It still causes serious problems, and sometimes death, if it is not treated. \n\nSyphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get HIV. Confection (having both syphilis and HIV) is common. In some big cities, it happens in as many as 30% to 60% of people with syphilis. \n\nNobody knows exactly where and how syphilis started. There are two major ideas about where the disease came from. \n\nThe first idea is called the \" Columbian hypothesis. \" (A hypothesis is an educated guess about how something happened). This hypothesis says that when Christopher Columbus's crew came back to Europe after exploring the \" New World \" , they brought syphilis back to Europe and spread the disease there. \n\nThe other idea is called the \" pre-Columbian hypothesis. \" ( \" Pre-Columbian \" means \" before Columbus. \" ) This hypothesis says that syphilis was already in Europe before Columbus, and people just did not realize that the disease existed. \n\nWhile there is evidence that can be used to say that either of these ideas are right, there is more evidence for the Columbian hypothesis. \n\nThe first written records that talk about an outbreak of syphilis in Europe are from 1494-1495. The outbreak happened in Naples, Italy, when France was invading (trying to take over Italy). Because syphilis was spread by French soldiers who were coming back from Italy, at first it was called the \" French disease. \" \n\nThe name \" syphilis \" was first used in 1530 by an Italian doctor and poet named Girolamo Fracastoreo. He used the word \" syphilis \" as the title of a Latin poem that talked about the damage the disease was causing in Italy. At other times in history, syphilis was also called the \" Great Pox \" . \n\nIn 1905, two men named Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann discovered that syphilis is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria. Five years later, Paul Ehrlich created the first treatment that helped treat syphilis (called Salvarsan). After that, scientists started to study penicillin. In 1943, it was officially decided that penicillin worked for syphilis. \n\nThis was a major success in the treatment of syphilis. Before penicillin, the treatments used for syphilis were often even worse than the disease. For example, people were treated with mercury (which is poisonous and causes serious health problems), or people were just kept away from everyone else. \n\nFrom 1932-1972, the United States Public Health Service did a study on syphilis in Alabama. They wanted to see how syphilis got worse when it was not treated. The researchers chose a group of poor African-American sharecroppers, but never told them they had syphilis. Even after the 1940s, when the researchers knew penicillin could cure these people, they refused to let them get treatment or even tell them that penicillin could help them. This study, now called the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, was very important in creating medical ethics. \n\nMany famous people in history may have had syphilis. For example, some people think that Franz Schubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, \u00c9douard Manet, and Adolf Hitler had the disease. \n\nSexually transmitted disease \n\nTreponema pallidum bacterium \n\nSafer sex \n\nTuskegee syphilis experiment \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:30:28Z", "text_length": 23626}

At that time, this disease was described by coming from the \" Le Clapiers \" part of the city of Paris. This part of the city was known to be where prostitutes lived. \n\nIt is caused by a bacterium, Neisseria gonorrheae. Since it is caused by a bacterium, it can be treated with antibiotics. The use of latex condoms when having sex can prevent it from spreading. Sometimes antibiotics do not cure gonorrhea. This is because the bacterium is becoming immune or resistant to the medicine.

{"title": "Cardiac arrest", "parsed_text": "Cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops beating. This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die. With cardiac arrest, normal circulation of blood stops, because of a failure of the heart to contract. This results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood, which causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation. Cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely. Unless the person is in hypothermia, brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes. (In some cases, the person is put into hypothermia on purpose, to help the person recover better with less damage.) \n\nCardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is treated early enough, some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients. When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD). First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available.", "timestamp": "2020-04-29T20:41:12Z", "text_length": 1164}
{"title": "Pulmonary embolism", "parsed_text": "A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material (an embolus) that blocks blood from getting to the lungs. It is usually caused by a blood clot that starts somewhere else in the body and travels to the lungs. However, it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, or bone. Rarely, while giving birth, a woman can get a clot of amniotic fluid. \n\nSymptoms of a pulmonary embolism start suddenly, as soon as the clot starts blocking blood flow to the lungs. Blood is supposed to pick up oxygen in the lungs and then carry that oxygen to the rest of the body. If blood cannot get through to the lungs, it cannot pick up oxygen or deliver it to the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. \n\nOften, the first sign of a pulmonary embolism is syncope (fainting), because the brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen. Other symptoms include: \n\nChest pain that feels like a knife sticking into the chest. The pain is often worse when the person breathes in. \n\nTrouble breathing \n\nHemoptysis (coughing up blood) \n\nLow oxygen saturation (because the body is not getting enough oxygen) \n\nThe worst kind of pulmonary embolism is caused by a saddle embolus. This kind of embolus blocks the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. This makes it impossible for any blood to get through to the lungs. Since no blood can get out to the rest of the body, the person's blood pressure drops and they can go into shock. A saddle embolus is a very serious medical emergency. Many people with this type of embolus die. \n\nThere are many risk factors that make it more likely for a person to get a pulmonary embolism. For example: \n\nSmoking \n\nA type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation ( \" A-fib \" ) \n\nRecent surgery (after surgery, the body's blood clotting system works harder than usual, to help heal the body. If clots travel to the lungs, they can cause a pulmonary embolism) \n\nBeing paralyzed, bedridden, or not able to move around very much \n\nSitting in one place for a long time, like on a long airplane flight (this makes the blood pool in the legs; if a blood clot forms in the leg, it can travel through the blood vessels to the lungs) \n\nRecent fracture of one of the long bones in the leg (because having a broken leg makes it harder to move around; also, clots of fat from the bone marrow can escape from the broken bone and travel to the lungs) \n\nHigh levels of estrogen because of pregnancy or some birth control pills \n\nHaving had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a large vein - before \n\nCertain kinds of cancer (some kinds can cause extra blood clotting) \n\nBeing overweight or obese \n\nThere are a few treatments for pulmonary embolism. The choice of which treatments to use depends on how serious the pulmonary embolism is. Treatments include: \n\nOxygen. Oxygen can be given through a special mask to make it easier for the person's body to get the oxygen it needs. \n\nAnticoagulants. These are medicines commonly called \" blood thinners. \" Doctors may give a few blood thinners together. For example, they may give heparin because it works right away. They may also give warfarin (Coumadin), which takes a few days to start working, but which the patient can keep taking at home. \n\nThrombolytics. These are medicines often called \" clot busters \" or \" clot dissolvers. \" They can quickly dissolve (break up) a clot. However, they are usually given only if a pulmonary embolism is life-threatening, because they can cause bleeding. \n\nRemoving the clot. Sometimes a doctor will thread a catheter (a flexible tube) up through a vein and into the lung. Once the doctor finds the clot, the catheter can be used to pull the clot out, or to give medicine to dissolve the clot. In very bad cases, surgery may be needed to remove a clot. \n\n", "timestamp": "2016-02-12T22:28:31Z", "text_length": 4101}

Sometimes doctors give other medicines along with epinephrine. \n\nWorldwide, about 0.05\u20132% of people have anaphylaxis at some point in their lives. Anaphylaxis appears to be getting more common. \n\nCases of anaphylaxis have been reported since ancient times. \n\nThe condition was originally named \" aphylaxis \" by Charles Richet in 1902. In 1913, Richet was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his work on anaphylaxis. \n\nLater, the name was changed to \" anaphylaxis \" because it sounded nicer. The word \" anaphylaxis \" comes from the Greek words \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac (ana), against, and \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 (phyla's), protection. \n\nAnaphylaxis can cause many different signs and symptoms over minutes or hours. If the anaphylaxis is caused by something that entered the body directly through the bloodstream (through a vein), symptoms appear within an average of 5 to 30 minutes. If it is caused by a food the person ate, symptoms appear within an average of 2 hours. \n\nThe most common body systems affected by anaphylaxis include: \n\nSkin (affected in 80\u201390% of cases) \n\nLungs and breathing pathways (70%) \n\nStomach and intestines (30\u201345%) \n\nHeart and blood vessels (10\u201345%) \n\nCentral nervous system (10\u201315%) \n\nPeople with anaphylaxis usually have problems with two or more of these body systems. \n\nSkin symptoms usually include: \n\nHives (raised, itchy bumps on the skin) \n\nItchiness \n\nFlushing (a red face or skin) \n\nSwollen lips \n\nRunny nose \n\nSwelling of the mucous membrane on the surface of the eye and eyelid (conjunctiva) \n\nAngioedema (swelling under the skin). People with angioedema may feel like their skin is burning instead of itching. \n\nIn 20% of cases, the tongue or throat may swell up, which can cause breathing problems. If a person is having breathing problems, the skin may turn blue because the body is not getting enough oxygen. This is called cyanosis. \n\nRespiratory signs and symptoms include: \n\nTrouble breathing (also called dyspnea or shortness of breath) \n\nBronchoconstriction (when the bronchi, the tubes that bring air to the lungs, get narrower; this makes it harder for air to get to the lungs) \n\n, pain with swallowing, or a cough \n\nWhen a medical professional listens to the patient's lungs with a stethoscope, they may hear: \n\nLow-pitched sounds called wheezes, caused by bronchoconstriction \n\nHigh-pitched sounds called stridor, caused by swelling in the upper airway \n\nWhen a person has anaphylaxis, some of the cells in the heart may release histamine. This can cause the heart\u2019s blood vessels to get narrower suddenly (this is called \" coronary artery spasm \" ). If the heart's blood vessels get too narrow, the heart cannot get enough blood. This can cause many serious problems: \n\nHeart cells can die. This is called a myocardial infarction, or a heart attack \n\nThe heart may beat too slowly or too quickly (these are called cardiac arrhythmias) \n\nThe heart may stop beating altogether. This is called cardiac arrest. \n\nAnaphylaxis can also cause low blood pressure. This may be caused by distributive shock, where the body's blood vessels get much wider because of the chemicals released by the immune system. It can also be caused by cardiogenic shock, where the heart is not getting enough blood to pump out to the rest of the body. \n\nLow blood pressure can cause many problems, including: \n\nA fast heart rate \n\nA slow heart rate. This is not very common. It happens in about 10% of cases. It is called the Bezold-Jarisch reflex \n\nSyncope (fainting) \n\nIn rare cases, very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis. \n\nPeople who already have heart disease are at greater risk of having heart problems from anaphylaxis. \n\nAnaphylaxis can also cause problems with other body systems: \n\nStomach and intestines: A person may have abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting (throwing up) \n\nUrinary and genital systems: Women may have pain in the pelvis that feels like cramps in the uterus. Men and women may lose control of their bladder. \n\nCentral nervous system: A person may have confused thoughts. They may have headaches caused by blood vessels in the brain getting wider. They may feel anxious (very worried) and believe they are going to die. \n\nAnaphylaxis can be caused by the body\u2019s response to almost any foreign substance (anything that is outside the body). Common causes include venom from insect bites or stings; foods; and medications. In children and young adults, foods are the most common trigger (or cause) of anaphylaxis. In older adults, medications and insect bites or stings are more common triggers. \n\nMany foods can trigger anaphylaxis, even when the food is eaten for the first time. In the Western world, the most common causes are eating or touching peanuts, wheat, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs. In the Middle East, sesame is a common trigger food. In Asia, rice and chickpeas often cause anaphylaxis. \n\nSevere cases of anaphylaxis usually happen when a person eats the trigger food. However, some people have severe anaphylaxis when the trigger food touches some part of their body. \n\nChildren can outgrow their allergies. For example, by age 16: \n\n80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs can eat these foods with no problems \n\n20% of children who had only one case of anaphylaxis to peanuts can eat peanuts with no problems \n\nAny medication may cause anaphylaxis. The most common are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin), then aspirin and NSAIDs. \n\nVenom from stinging or biting insects, like bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) or kissing bugs (Triatominae), may cause anaphylaxis. If a person has a bad allergic reaction to venom once, they have a greater risk of having anaphylaxis if they are stung or bitten again. However, half of the people who die of anaphylaxis have had no anaphylactic reaction before. \n\nCertain diseases, called atopic diseases, can make a person more likely to have allergies. Atopic diseases include asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. People with these diseases have a high risk of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and radiocontrast agents. However, these people do not have a higher risk from injected medications or stings. \n\nOne study of children with anaphylaxis found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases. More than 90% of children who die from anaphylaxis have asthma. \n\nThe risk of having another anaphylactic reaction decreases as a person avoids the trigger for longer and longer. \n\nAnaphylaxis usually happens because the immune system over-reacts to an allergen. The immune system releases mast cells and basophils, which are types of white blood cells. The immune system sees the trigger as something bad and sends out white blood cells to kill it. The mast cells and basophils attach to the allergen to try to kill it. However, because the system is over-reacting, the mast cells and basophils explode and dump out chemicals that cause inflammation, like histamine. Histamine causes many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis. For example: \n\nBronchoconstriction (where the tubes that carry air to the lungs get narrower) \n\nVasodilation (where the blood vessels get wider) \n\nFluid leaks out of blood vessels \n\nThe heart muscle does not work as well \n\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed based on signs, symptoms, and knowing that a person has been exposed to an allergen. It is very likely that a person has anaphylaxis if any of these three things happen within minutes or hours after they were exposed to an allergen: \n\nProblems with the skin or mucosal tissue, plus either breathing problems or a low blood pressure \n\nTwo or more of these symptoms: \n\n#Problems with the skin or mucosa \n\n#Breathing problems \n\n#Low blood pressure \n\n#Gastrointestinal symptoms \n\nLow blood pressure after exposure to an allergen \n\nIf a person has a bad reaction to an insect sting or a medication, blood tests for tryptase or histamine might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis. However, these tests are not very useful if the cause is food, or if the person has a normal blood pressure. Also, these tests cannot say for sure that a person does not have anaphylaxis. \n\nAllergy testing may help to identify what caused a person\u2019s anaphylaxis. Skin allergy tests (such as patch tests) can be done for certain foods and venoms. Skin tests can diagnose an allergy to penicillin, but there are no skin tests for other medications. Blood tests can diagnose milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and fish allergies. \n\nSometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between anaphylaxis; asthma; fainting caused by not having enough oxygen; and panic attacks. However, there are some important differences between these conditions: \n\nPeople with asthma usually do not have itching, swelling, or problems with their stomach or intestines. \n\nAfter fainting, a person's skin is pale, and they will not have a rash or swelling. Their breath sounds will be normal. \n\nA person who is having a panic attack may have flushed skin, but will not have hives or swelling. Usually their blood pressure will not be low. Their breath sounds will be normal. \n\nThe best way to prevent anaphylaxis is to avoid the trigger that caused anaphylaxis in the past. When this is not possible, there may be treatments to make the body stop reacting to the trigger. This is called desensitization. For example, treatment of the immune system (immunotherapy) with Hymenoptera venoms is able to make 80\u201390% of adults and 98% of children stop having allergic reactions to bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants. Most people who are allergic to certain medicines can just avoid those medicines. However, desensitization is possible for many medications (for example, many chemotherapies) if the person has to take those medicines. \n\nPeople with latex allergies may have to avoid \" cross-reactive foods. \" These are foods that have ingredients that are similar to latex. Examples of these foods includeavocados, bananas, and potatoes. \n\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require emergency medical treatment. Some patients need help keeping their airways open so they can breathe in air. Other patients need to be given extra oxygen or large amounts of intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle into a vein). \n\nEpinephrine is the best treatment for anaphylaxis. Doctors often give antihistamines (which destroy histamine) and steroids along with epinephrine. Once a person has returned to normal, they should be watched in the hospital for 2 to 24 hours to make sure their symptoms do not return. \n\nEpinephrine is the best and first treatment used for anaphylaxis. It reverses many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis. For example, it makes the bronchi (the passages to the lungs) get wider; it makes the blood vessels go back to their normal size; and it raises blood pressure. \n\nEpinephrine comes in an \" auto-injector, \" usually called an \" EpiPen. \" Once its safety cap is taken off, the EpiPen just has to be pressed into the thigh, and the right amount of epinephrine will automatically be injected into the person's body. Doctors can prescribe EpiPens to people who know they have allergies, so they can treat themselves for anaphylaxis. Many ambulances also carry EpiPens to treat anaphylaxis. \n\nThe EpiPen is meant to be injected into the thigh muscle, on the outside of the leg, as soon as anaphylaxis is suspected. There is no reason why it should not be used if a person is having an anaphylactic reaction. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if the person is still having breathing problems or other major symptoms. A second dose is needed in 16 to 35% of cases. More than two doses are rarely needed. \n\nEpinephrine can cause minor side effects, including tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations. \n\nEpinephrine may not work in people who are taking \u03b2-blockers. In these people, if epinephrine does not work, doctors can give intravenous glucagon. \n\nPeople who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to have an \" allergy action plan. \" These plans often include: \n\nParents telling schools about their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency \n\nKnowing how and when to use EpiPens \n\nWearing a medical alert bracelet that says what the person is allergic to \n\nPlanning for how to avoid triggers \n\nIf anaphylaxis is diagnosed and the person is treated quickly, there is a good chance that they will recover. Even if nobody knows what caused the anaphylaxis, the person usually makes a good recovery as long as they get medication to stop the reaction. \n\nWhen people die from anaphylaxis, they usually die from respiratory (breathing) problems, usually the airway closing up, or cardiovascular problems, like shock. About 0.7% to 20% of people with anaphylaxis die from it. Some people die within minutes. \n\nVery rarely, people have exercise-induced anaphylaxis - anaphylaxis that is caused by exercise. These people usually do well. They usually have fewer anaphylactic episodes, which are less severe, as they get older. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-14T21:17:28Z", "text_length": 17786}
{"title": "Hypertension", "parsed_text": "Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is higher than it should be. This requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels. \n\nThe pressure in the arteries changes depending on what the heart is doing. When the heart squeezes, pumping blood into the arteries, the pressure increases. When the heart relaxes, the pressure decreases. When blood pressure is measured, the highest pressure (when the heart is squeezing) is called the systolic blood pressure. The lowest pressure (when the heart is relaxing) is called the diastolic blood pressure. \n\nBlood pressure is written as two numbers. For example, in the picture at the right, the person's systolic blood pressure was 158. Their diastolic blood pressure was 99. This blood pressure is written as 158/99. It is said \" 158 over 99. \" \n\nThere are two types of hypertension, called \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary.\u201d Primary hypertension means that the hypertension is not caused by any other disease or condition and it gradually develops over time with age. Secondary hypertension means that the hypertension is caused by another disease or conditions. Secondary hypertension tend to result in higher blood pressure than primary hypertension. In most cases (90-95%), hypertension is primary. Only a small amount of hypertension (5-10%) is secondary. \n\nThere are various health conditions that leads to secondary hypertension which includes: Obstructive sleep apnea, Kidney problems, Adrenal gland tumors, Thyroid problems, Certain defects you're born with (congenital) in blood vessels, Certain medications (birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs), Illegal drugs (cocaine and amphetamines). \n\nHypertension can cause many problems, including heart attack, stroke, Aneurysm, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, vision loss, Metabolic syndrome, Dementia, etc.. \n\nTo stay healthy, most people should try to keep their blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. \n\nThe risk factors includes age, Race, Family history or genes, obesity, lack of physical activity, chewing or smoking tobacco, too much salt in diet, not enough potassium in diet, alcohol, stress, kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea. \n\nHypertension can often be fixed with changes in diet or lifestyle. The 2004 British Hypertension Society suggests that people with high blood pressure: \n\nLose weight if they are overweight or obese \n\nExercise regularly \n\nDecrease the amount of salt they eat \n\nLimit the amount of alcohol they drink \n\nEat a lot of fruits and vegetables \n\nIf lifestyle changes do not decrease a person's blood pressure, then the person may need medications. A doctor will choose which medications to use, based on what other medical problems the person has. Examples of medications that decrease blood pressure include: \n\nDiuretics, which increase urination to get rid of extra fluid \n\nBeta blockers, which slow down the heart rate \n\nACE inhibitors, which relax the arteries \n\nEven small decreases in blood pressure can have a large effect on a person's health. For example, decreasing\u00a0blood pressure\u00a0by 5\u00a0mmHg (for example, from 150/100 to 145/95 mmHg) can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%.

{"title": "Phenylketonuria", "parsed_text": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder (a disease a person is born with) where a person's body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. Amino acids are necessary to make proteins, an important part of the human body. Phenylalanine only comes from the food we eat; our bodies do not make any by themselves. \n\nAverage people produce an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase in their bodies. When they ingest phenylalanine, the body cannot use it, so this enzyme changes phenylalanine into tyrosine, which the body can use. In people with PKU, very little or no enzyme is made. Since the phenylalanine they eat is not being changed into tyrosine, it builds up in their bodies. This can cause problems with the way their bodies work. \n\nSymptoms vary from person to person. Because of the rarity of PKU, many symptoms go undiagnosed or unrecognized. In addition, there are variations in the categories of PKU individuals. There are untreated, early treated, late treated, those returning to diet, Hyperphe, Classical PKU, uncontrolled, and highly controlled. For your average infant a doctor will diagnose PKU with a quick blood test. Their symptom will be high PHE levels. If that infant goes undiagnosed for weeks or months, he/she may start to exhibit some or all of the following symptoms for uncontrolled PKU. The symptoms include: \n\nfocus/concentration problems \n\nseizures \n\nlowered intelligence \n\ntremors \n\nproblems with memory \n\ngait (walking) problems \n\nanxiety \n\nskin problems \n\ndepression \n\nmousy odor \n\naggression \n\nirritability \n\nphobias \n\nmental fog \n\nslower thinking and response \n\nhyperactivity \n\nlethargy \n\nsocial anxiety \n\ndecreased motor function and hand/eye coordination \n\nfatigue \n\npsychotic symptoms \n\nmild paralysis \n\nautistic behaviors \n\nsocial withdrawals \n\nlack of autonomy \n\nsocial maturity deficits \n\ndecreased positive emotions \n\nlow self-esteem \n\nToday, scientists know what foods have phenylalanine in them, and they have created a special diet for people with PKU. Since they cannot use it, people with PKU cannot eat foods that have a lot of phenylalanine, like eggs, meat and milk. An artificial sweetener called aspartame is also a source of phenylalanine. People with PKU take a lot of vitamins to make up for the foods they cannot eat, especially vitamins B6 and B12. \n\nBabies with PKU are fed a special formula. It has everything babies need to stay healthy, but with very little phenylalanine. There are also low protein foods like breads and flour (Made from corn and starch instead of regular wheat). \n\nWomen with PKU who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have to be especially careful to follow this diet. If they do not follow the diet, their babies could be born with severe birth defects and mental retardation. Babies born to women with PKU who have followed the PKU diet throughout their pregnancy are usually healthy and do not necessarily but may develop PKU. Whether or not they have PKU themselves depends on the mother and father's genes. In fact there are people who are Carriers (Dormant Genes) that can be passed on until they resurface in the future generations. These are so far undetectable, However, since PKU is genetically recessive it takes PKU genes from both parents to cause PKU. \n\nPKU kids usually have light hair and eyes due to the effect of phenylalanine in the production of melanin. They also tend to have very fair skin which can cause them to burn easily. Solar protection is a must for those who wish to work, play, or engage in activities outdoors. \n\nMost people with PKU can live as long and healthy as anyone else if the low-phenylalanine diet is started when they are babies and continued for the rest of their lives. The symptoms will usually disappear after the diet is started. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T17:33:01Z", "text_length": 3967}
{"title": "Wart", "parsed_text": "Warts are growths on the skin. Very often they resemble solid blisters. Usually, applying pressure to a wart causes pain. Warts are caused by viruses in the HPV family. As there are many types of viruses in the HPV family, there are also many types of wart. In most cases, warts are not dangerous, but may cause a lot of pain. \n\nThe virus infects skin cells; if these skin cells move to other areas, new warts can grow there. Warts contain tissue that bleeds easily. A bleeding of this tissue allows the wart to spread to other places. In general, coming in contact with infected tissue spreads the infection. \n\nThere are different ways of getting rid of a wart: \n\nThe immune system fights the virus, and can make the wart disappear. \n\nThere are different drugs; many of them are corrosive acids. Regular application on the skin kills the cells which were infected by the virus. Other drugs strengthen the immune system. \n\nSome of the acids are difficult to handle, or have side-effects. Often, trained medical personnel is needed for their use. \n\nDifferent forms of surgery exist: Using a laser, electricity, or infrared radiation. Very often, the use of surgery causes scars. \n\nThere are different types of warts, caused by different HPV viruses: \n\ncommon wart: a wart standing out, with a rough surface, usually occurs on hands or knees. \n\nflat wart: A small smooth flattened wart,which can occur in large numbers. Most common on the face, neck, hands, wrists and knees; \n\nfiliform or digitate wart: These warts look like threads or fingers. Most common on the face, especially near the eyelids and lips; \n\nplantar wart: A hard sometimes painful lump, often with many black dots in the center; usually only found on pressure points on the soles of the feet and on hands; \n\nmosaic wart: Many plantar warts close together. Usually on the hands or soles of the feet \n\ngenital wart A wart that occurs on the genitals. \n\nThere are different ways of getting rid of a wart: \n\nThere are some over the counter drugs, that usually contain an acid, very often salicylic acid. Getting rid of a wart that way involves cleaning the area around the wart, and treating it with the acid. This will slowly kill wart tissue. Dead tissue can then be removed. Getting rid of a wart that way usually takes several weeks. There are different drugs, with different acids. Some prescription drugs may contain stronger acids, such as chloroacetic acid or silver nitrate. All acids are caustic. This means, healthy tissue around the wart needs to be protected, before the substance is applied. \n\nIt is possible to kill off the wart using extreme cold (called cryotherapy). A physician or a specialist doctor for skin diseases usially does this. Before the cold is applied, a local anestetic is used to reduce the pain. Using this method will cause scars. \n\nIt is possible to do a special chemotherapy, called cytostatis.

Some forms are caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis or syphilis can also cause hepatitis; so can the parasite that causes malaria. \n\nHepatitis can also be caused by alcohol. About one in four people who drink more than three alcoholic drinks a day (over a period of 10\u201315 days) will have some form of hepatitis caused by alcohol. \n\nVarious drugs and chemicals can also cause hepatitis, most notably paracetamol (overdose), yellow phosphorous, and others. Hepatitis may also be caused by other diseases. \n\nHepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, eating raw seafood, or drinking water with the hepatitis A virus in it. This happens mostly in third world countries. Strict personal hygiene and avoiding raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection. \n\nOnce a person has hepatitis A, their immune system makes antibodies to fight the virus. This will make them immune against future infection. \n\nPeople with hepatitis A should rest, drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol. The time between the infection and the start of the illness can run from 15 to 45 days. About 15% of people with hepatitis A have symptoms from six months to a year after the first diagnosis. Infected people excrete the hepatitis A virus in their stool two weeks before and one week after the appearance of jaundice. \n\nThere is a vaccine for hepatitis A. It will protect against hepatitis A for life. \n\nHepatitis B is not spread by food or casual contact. Instead, hepatitis B is spread by blood or body fluids from an infected person. A baby can get it from its mother during childbirth, and it can also be spread by sexual contact, use of street drugs, and unsafe medical care. Some people just have hepatitis B for a little while and then suppress the infection. Others can be infected for life, usually with few or no symptoms for many years. Hepatitis B sometimes damages the liver severely, and can cause cancer. \n\nThere is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but there is treatment. \n\nHepatitis C is not spread by food or casual contact. It is spread in ways that are similar to hepatitis B.

Other symptoms include headaches, fevers, back and neck aches, chills, bad breath, weak voice, fatigue, having trouble swallowing, and more. There are treatments for tonsillitis. One treatment is antibiotics. Medicines to relieve pain like Tylenol and Advil are also suggested. The tonsils may be removed surgically if it is medically necessary.

{"title": "Encephalitis", "parsed_text": "Encephalitis is sudden inflammation (swelling) in the brain. It is usually caused by viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens. As the brain swells, it can get damaged when it gets crushed against the skull. Encephalitis can cause serious symptoms, like seizures and strokes, and can be fatal. In 2013, encephalitis killed about 77,000 people in the world. \n\nUsually, adults with encephalitis have a fever that starts suddenly, a headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may be irritable (easily upset), not want to eat, and have a fever. Usually, patients are either very tired or confused. \n\nA stiff neck is a sign that the person has either meningitis (inflammation of the meninges, which cover the brain) or meningoencephalitis (swelling of both the meninges and the brain). \n\nViral encephalitis can happen when a virus infects the brain. The most common causes are the rabies virus, Herpes Simplex Virus(HSV), the polio virus, and the measles virus. Viral encephalitis can also be caused by a latent virus - a virus that hides from the body's immune system the brain's nerve cells. Two examples of viruses that cause latent infection are the varicella-zoster viruses, which can hide in the brain after causing chicken pox, and the herpes simplex virus. \n\nAbout 100 different viruses can infect the brain. Other examples include West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. \n\nEncephalitis can happen when a person gets a bacterial infection, like bacterial meningitis. It can also be a complication of an infectious disease that a person already has, like syphilis. This is called \" secondary encephalitis. \" \n\nExamples of other bacteria which can cause encephalitis are Staphylococcus aureus, which causes toxic shock syndrome; Bordetella pertussis, which causes pertussis (whooping cough); and types of Borellia bacteria, which cause Lyme disease. \n\nSome parasites can infect the brain, especially in people who have weak immune systems. Examples include Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis; two parasites from the species Trypanosoma brucei, which cause African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness); and Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria. \n\nAutoimmune diseases can cause encephalitis if the body's immune system attacks the brain, the spinal cord, and their nerves. Two examples are autoimmune encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalitis. \n\nEncephalitis can be diagnosed in a few different ways: \n\nAn MRI (brain scan) can show brain swelling, and also show whether there are other brain problems causing a patient's symptoms \n\nAn EEG (a picture of the brain's electrical activity) will show signals that are not normal \n\nA lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will show whether there is an infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (which bathes the brain and spinal cord) \n\nBlood tests or urine tests may show whether a person has encephalitis, or if they have another illness instead \n\nSome treatments for encephalitis depend on the cause: \n\nViral encephalitis is treated with anti-viral medications \n\nBacterial encephalitis is treated with antibiotic medications \n\nOther treatments are \" supportive \" - they treat the symptoms of encephalitis. For example: \n\nSteroid medications are used to decrease swelling in the brain \n\nAnticonvulsant medications can stop seizures \n\nSedative medications can help with restlessness and irritability \n\nAcetaminophen can decrease fever and headache \n\nPhysical therapy and speech therapy can help if the person has trouble moving or speaking after their infection is gone \n\nVaccines have made encephalitis from some diseases much less common. These diseases include measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, varicella (chicken pox), and pertussis (whooping cough). There are also vaccines for rabies, bacterial meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and some other diseases that can cause encephalitis. \n\nPeople can protect themselves from diseases that are spread by insects, like Lyme disease and malaria, by avoiding insect bites. For example, they can use bug spray; wear long sleeves and long pants; sleep under a mosquito net; and make sure they have good window and door screens. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-06-14T12:30:25Z", "text_length": 4898}

{"title": "Amnesia", "parsed_text": "Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory. It is a loss of memory, that is to say, a person cannot remember certain things. Amnesia can be caused when someone has brain damage, a disease or when something really stressful happens. \n\nThere are two \" main types \" : \n\nAnterograde amnesia: Short term memory is not transferred to long-term memory any more. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. \n\nRetrograde amnesia: The person can no longer recall information that happened before a certain date. The date is usually the date of an accident or an operation. \n\nThe fact that adults usually cannot remember events that occurred in early childhood is called \" infantile amnesia \" . It is attributed to the development of the brain or that of the child. It is not seen as a form of amnesia comparable to the other types. \n\nThere are three main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person. \n\nHead trauma. This includes any kind of injury to the brain that might cause amnesia. \n\nTraumatic events. This happens when a person's mind is so stressed that it chooses to forget what happened rather than to deal with it. \n\nPhysical deficiencies. These are things that happen to your brain but it is different than head trauma because it mostly deals with complications that happen after surgery. \n\nSome other different types of amnesia include: \n\nCaused by an [Injury|trauma], for example a head injury; called post-traumatic amnesia. \n\nDissociative amnesia: Here the cause is psychological, and usually not related to physical damage in the brain. This includes \n\nRepressed memory (where it is not possible to remember a specific event) - The memory is usually still there, but the person blocks access to it; Stressful events such as being raped may lead to Dissociative amnesia \n\nChildhood amnesia - the inability of adults to remember certain parts of their childhood. \n\nDrug (usually [alcohol])-induced blackout - anterograde amnesia, affecting the immediate past \n\nAmnesia can be permanent, or it can be temporary. Damage to the [brain], or the use of certain [drug]s can cause amnesia. Some of these drugs are [sedative]s. Another well known cause for amnesia can be drinking too much [alcohol]. Those kinds of causes are called organic, because they can been directly seen. Other causes cannot directly be seen, they are called functional. Rather they are [psychology|psychological] in their nature. People may want to shield off a traumatic event they witnessed, for example. \n\nAnother minor cause of amnesia is \" heartbreak \" in a relationship. It can lead to trauma, but it is not necessarily traumatic. \n\nSometimes certain types of amnesia fix themselves without being treated. There are also different types of therapy that work with the brain to help with amnesia.

{"title": "Coronary artery disease", "parsed_text": "Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart disease, is a heart disease. ( \" Coronary \" means \" the blood vessels of the heart \" .) Coronary heart disease causes plaque to build up inside the coronary arteries. This causes the coronary arteries to become narrower. An artery is a blood vessel - a tube that carries blood. After the heart supplies blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients, the arteries carry the blood to different parts of the body. The coronary arteries are very important: they supply blood to the heart muscle. So when the coronary arteries become narrower, less blood gets to the heart muscle. \n\nMost people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms. The most common symptom is a heart attack. If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart. Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death. It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old. Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women. \n\nAtherosclerosis is a form of heart disease. It causes fatty materials (like cholesterol) to build up in the arteries, forming harder materials called plaques. This causes the arteries to become harder. It also makes it more difficult for blood to flow through the arteries. This can cause blood clots to form, blocking blood from traveling through the arteries. Small pieces of plaque can also break off and block smaller blood vessels. \n\nIf an artery becomes blocked completely, it causes serious problems. All cells, tissues, and organs in the body need oxygen and nutrients (carried by blood) to survive. If cells or tissues are not supplied with enough blood, they will die. (This is called necrosis.) When this happens in the coronary arteries, a section of the heart dies. This can cause a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) to happen. \n\nPeople can do many different things to keep themselves from getting coronary heart disease: \n\nThey can change their diet. For example, they can eat fewer fatty foods, and take in as few saturated fats as possible. \n\nThey can eat more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. \n\nThey can avoid drinking alcohol, and can take in less salt. \n\nThey can exercise regularly. \n\nThey can avoid becoming overweight or obese by doing things to control their weight. \n\nAtherosclerosis", "timestamp": "2017-02-20T03:21:40Z", "text_length": 2544}

{"title": "Bipolar disorder", "parsed_text": "Bipolar disorder (also known as manic depression) is a mental illness where a person will have repeated, long-lasting feelings (episodes) of high (mania) and low mood (depression). It may occur with or without cycles of normal mood, called euthymia. A mixed episode occurs when both mania and depression are present at the same time. \n\n\" Bipolar \" literally means \" two poles \" or two extremes in how much energy the brain has. Sometimes, a person can experience something called mania. Mania is when a person's brain goes into a high-energy state. When in a high-energy state, mania can cause extreme emotions such as panic attacks or extreme happiness such as euphoria. This feeling is often followed by a period of depression, which is a low-energy state. A person who is depressed may act sad or hopeless. People with bipolar disorder switch between these two states. \n\nPeople who are in a manic state are often over-confident and very optimistic. This can cause them to take large risks and do things that are not normal for them to do. Manic episodes last for at least a week, but can last as long as three to six months. They are usually followed by a depressive episode. A person who is manic may talk very quickly with no pauses, have thoughts that change very quickly, or act without thinking. They may also experience psychosis, where they cannot tell what is real and what is not. They may think that they are unstoppable or that they are on a mission for God. Mania may become so severe that it can affect the person\u2019s ability to work or interact with others. Every person is different, so it is important to remember that these things do not happen to all people with bipolar disorder. \n\nHypomania is a less extreme version of mania. Someone who is hypomanic will have symptoms similar to mania. They may have increased energy and may deny that anything is wrong. A hypomanic episode may last from a few days to a few months. \n\nPeople who are in a depressive state are often sad and pessimistic. They may lose interest in activities they usually like, or become isolated and lonely. Other symptoms include anxiety, hopelessness, changes in sleep, and suicidal thoughts. A depressive episode can last from a few weeks to several months. When bipolar disorder develops at a young age, the first few episodes are usually depressive. Because a manic or hypomanic episode is needed to diagnose bipolar disorder, some people are diagnosed with major depression at first. \n\nBipolar disorder is an illness that can show in different ways. It is often diagnosed in adolescents or young adults. A few subtypes have been identified; these subtypes mostly describe the nature of the \" episodes \" of the disease: \n\nBipolar I disorder: A person with bipolar I has had at least one manic episode. Depressive episodes also occur in people with bipolar I, but are not required for a diagnosis. \n\nBipolar II disorder: A person with bipolar II has had no manic episodes, but at least one hypomanic episode. They have also had at least one major depressive episode. \n\nCyclothymia: A person with cyclothymia has had both hypomanic and feelings of depression. These feelings of depression are not extreme enough to be considered a depressive episode. \n\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. It is estimated that there is a 71 percent chance of bipolar disorder passing from parent to child. If one identical twin has bipolar disorder, there is a 40 to 70 percent chance that the other will develop bipolar disorder in their lifetime. MRI studies have shown that certain parts of the brain responsible for mood regulation are larger in bipolar patients. It is also possible for bipolar disorder to develop after a stroke, brain injury, or certain infections. \n\nLike most mental illnesses, there are ways to treat bipolar disorder. The most common way to treat bipolar disorder is by using medications called mood stabilizers. These medicines prevent and control the manic and depressive episodes. One of the most common mood stabilizers is lithium. Therapy can also be used to control the symptoms. The same treatments and medicines do not work for everyone, and it is not uncommon for people to have symptoms return if they stop taking medication. Things like this can make bipolar disorder a difficult illness to live with, but educating patients about it makes it easier. Sometimes, people need to be treated against their will. Patients may be thinking about or have tried to commit suicide, or they may be unable to see their situation properly. In many cases, teaching people about their disease helps. When they have gone through the phases of the illness a few times, they often see that treatment can make their life easier. \n\nGenetics links between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia per recent study. \n\n5 Disorders Share Genetic Risk Factors, Study Finds February 28, 2013 The New York Times \n\nPsychiatric Disorders Linked Genetically February 27, 2013 WSJ \n\n. \n\n.

{"title": "Dissociative identity disorder", "parsed_text": "Dissociative identity disorder (DID), is a mental disorder. \n\nIt was called multiple personality disorder (MPD). It is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual DSM IV. \n\nThis is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it. The main symptoms of DID are a person showing two or more \" identities \" or \" personality states \" . The person behaves differently depending which identity is in control. The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget. \n\nA person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by drugs, illness or (with children) pretending to play with imaginary friends. Doctors must also rule out pretending to have DID for attention or sympathy, and malingering (pretending to have DID for some personal gain). Most patients with DID are also diagnosed with other mental disorders. \n\nThe DSM IV uses the terms \" identity \" , \" personality states \" and \" alternate identities \" when talking about DID and other people use the term \" alters \" to mean the same thing. These words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition. Professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a personality; other terms, including dissociation and amnesia, may also be defined differently by different professionals. When talking about DID, saying someone changes personalities or alters means the person speaks and acts differently, and usually responds to a different name. \n\nDissociation is a symptom. Most people experience normal dissociation, where they stop paying attention to what is happening around them. People with DID have pathological dissociation, which is much more serious. It involves problems with memory and attention that make it hard for people to work, shop and have relationships with other people. Everyone can dissociate but some people can do it much more easily and to an extreme that can be unhealthy. Some doctors think trauma causes the dissociation that is seen in disorders like DID. \n\nAccording to the DSM-IV, the symptoms of DID are \" the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states \" (which are often called \" alters \" ), as well as forgetting things that people normally don't forget. Also, the symptoms cannot be caused by drugs or normal childhood play. People can report having a lot of alters, or just a couple. Most people diagnosed with DID have less than ten, though some have said they have several thousand. A person diagnosed with DID cannot be diagnosed with another dissociative disorder. Because people with DID hear voices of different alters, it may be confused with schizophrenia. However, the two problems are very different and doctors can usually tell if a patient has DID or schizophrenia by asking the right questions. DID is always diagnosed by what patients tell their doctors and what the doctor thinks this means. There are no objective tests using blood or machines that can tell if someone has DID. Though people have tried diagnosing and studying DID using medical imaging or brain scanning. \n\nThe DSM uses the following criteria to diagnose DID: \n\nAt least two \" distinct identities \" that alternate control of behavior \n\nInability to recall \" important personal information too great \" to be attributed to \" ordinary forgetfulness \" \n\nNone of the above are due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition \n\nThe International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) uses the term multiple personality disorder instead of dissociative identity disorder. It classifies DID in section F44.8, \" Other dissociative [conversion] disorders \" . \n\nThere are two main ideas about what causes DID, but there is still disagreement about which is correct. The trauma model says that DID is caused by parents or family that abuse or neglect their children. Some of these children deny the abuse is happening or pretend it is happening to someone else, and this eventually becomes a different identity or alter. Most people diagnosed with DID say they remember being abused by their parents or other caregivers when they were children. When asked about their childhood, patients with DID are more likely to say they were abused or neglected than people with any other diagnosis. However, the idea that DID develops in childhood is disputed because childhood memories are not very reliable and it is not clear if the abuse actually happened. Though DID has been diagnosed in children, there are reasons to believe the diagnosis is because of the influence of parents and doctors rather than abuse. There is not enough good scientific evidence about DID in childhood to be sure DID is actually caused by abuse or something else. \n\nThe iatrogenic or sociocognitive model (SCM) of DID says it is created during psychotherapy when the therapist creates false memories and patients become convinced they have multiple personalities. Some patients may be more likely to develop DID in these circumstances because they are naturally more likely to accept their therapists are right about DID. SCM supporters also think that patients have seen DID in movies and books, and this shows them how people with DID are supposed to behave, which makes it easier for them to change their behavior when they are supposed to be a new alter. They also say the criteria used by the DSM are unclear which makes it hard to agree whether a patient has DID or another diagnosis. \n\nA middle position says that trauma may change how the brain remembers things which makes it easier to remember things that did not actually happen. It has also been suggested that early trauma may make children more likely to use their imaginations to pretend abuse or other painful situations are not happening, and if they enter therapy when they are older, it is easier for therapists to convince them they have DID. \n\nThere is no treatment approach that has been scientifically proven to work. Most therapists who treat patients with DID use several different approaches. Therapy usually lasts for several years, and does not always work. Some therapists try to reduce or eliminate the alters so the patient only has one personality, while others do not. The ISSTD recommends first improving a patient's ability to deal with symptoms and live more normal lives, then trying to deal with traumatic memories. The final step is bringing all the identities together so the patient can access all of their memories. \n\nSometimes patients with DID will get better without any help, but this is not common. Patients with more diagnoses than just DID often take longer to improve. \n\nThere have been no large-scale studies to learn how common DID is. The ISSTD says DID occurs in between 1 and 3% in the general population, and between 1 and 5% in groups of patients in hospitals. DID is more common in women than in men but this may be caused by men with DID being sent to prison instead of hospitals. The number of people diagnosed with DID increased from about 200 in 1970 to about 20,000 in the 1990s. According to the ISSTD this is because doctors did not have the training or experience to recognize DID. Instead they diagnosed people with depression, PTSD or borderline personality disorder. People who support the SCM say the increase in diagnoses was because a small number of doctors diagnosed a large number of people and because a large number of therapists began using types of psychotherapy that made people think they had DID. \n\nBefore 1900 it was thought DID was caused by spirits or ghosts who controlled people's behavior. The first case of DID described in medicine was in 1646 by the Swiss doctor Paracelsus. DID was very uncommon until the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1990 the number of cases reported in medicine went from about 200 to more than 20,000. In 1994, the 4th edition of the DSM was published, which changed the name from \" multiple personality disorder \" to \" dissociative identity disorder \" . The DSM also changed how DID was diagnosed. Many scientific articles were written about DID during the same period, though after 1995 the number of articles published every year decreased. Today there is little research on DID. \n\nEven though DID is a very rare, there are a lot of books, plays and movies about people with DID. In 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson published the short book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which was very popular. People later thought that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were examples of someone with DID. The Three Faces Of Eve was a movie made in 1957 about a woman with DID. Sybil, a popular book about a woman with DID, was published in 1973. It was made into a movie in 1976, and a second time in 2007. A survey done in 2001 of American and Canadian psychiatrists found that there was a lot of disagreement and skepticism about diagnosing DID and if the diagnosis was based on enough good quality science. \n\nLawyers and doctors who work with the law also consider DID to be very controversial. Since the 1990s, DID has become more common in courts. People have tried to avoid going to prison for such crimes as murder and serial rape by claiming to have DID, and lawyers and judges are concerned about people pretending to have DID to avoid going to prison. The first time this happened was in 1976, and since that time most people who commit crimes claim it was because of DID have gone to prison. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-21T17:12:57Z", "text_length": 11093}

If the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional, it is called decapitation. It can happen because of an auto accident, explosion, factory accident, a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident. \n\nDecapitation is always fatal, that is, the result is always death. This is because it causes all other organs to stop receiving nervous signals from the brain that are needed to function, while the supply of blood, and therefore oxygen, to the brain itself is also cut off. \n\nDecapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead. In these situations, the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning. \n\nBeheading was the usual means of death penalty in Scandinavian countries in the past. Noblemen were beheaded with a sword, commoners with an axe. The last execution by beheading in Finland occurred in 1822, when a farmhand Tahvo Putkonen was beheaded for murder.

{"title": "Stillbirth", "parsed_text": "A stillbirth happens when a fetus (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother or dies during delivery (childbirth). It is said that the delivered baby is stillborn. Stillbirth is different from a miscarriage because a stillbirth happens after the baby has been living inside its mother 20 to 24 weeks (depending on the country). It is called a miscarriage if the baby lived inside the mother for less time. \n\nThe causes of many stillbirths are unknown, even when special tests are done to learn the cause. \n\nnicotine, alcohol, or drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy \n\nphysical trauma \n\nradiation poisoning \n\nRh disease \n\numbilical cord problems \n\nThe number of stillbirths in the United States is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20 minutes. In developing countries, where medical care is not as advanced or good, the number of stillbirths is higher. \n\nIn Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is about 1 in 200 babies. \n\nThe death of the baby is usually treated like the death of an older baby. The family may have a funeral. The body of the dead baby can be buried or cremated (burned). In some places, there are special places for putting the bodies or the ashes of stillborn babies. \n\nThe mother may be ill. Her body may be hurt from having the baby. \n\nIn the UK, any baby that leaves its mother's body after 24 weeks and does not show any signs of life is called a stillbirth. The mother or father must tell the government about the baby. A Stillbirth Certificate is given to the family. \n\nIn Australia, any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be reported to the government. \n\nThe United States does not have a formal definition of stillborn babies. All pregnancies are legally called either: live birth, fetal death, or induced termination of pregnancy (abortion). The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage.

{"title": "Ventricular fibrillation", "parsed_text": "Ventricular fibrillation (often shortened to VF or V-Fib) is a type of arrhythmia of the heart. \" Arrhythmia \" means the heart is not beating normally. \n\nWhen a person is in ventricular fibrillation, the heart does not beat in any kind of pattern. Instead, it quivers and twitches very quickly. \n\nThis problem is called \" ventricular \" fibrillation because it affects the ventricles of the heart. The ventricles are the biggest parts of the heart. Their job is to pump blood (which carries oxygen) to the lungs and the rest of the body. When a person is in ventricular fibrillation, the ventricles cannot do this job. This means that the lungs, brain, and other organs will not get enough blood or oxygen. \n\nVentricular fibrillation is a medical emergency. Without enough blood and oxygen, no part of the body can survive. If ventricular fibrillation continues for long enough, the blood will stop circulating around the body. The person's breathing and heart will stop. The person will die unless they get treatment quickly. \n\nVentricular fibrillation can be stopped by shocking the person with electricity from a defibrillator. If a defibrillator is not available, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be done to keep the blood flowing until an ambulance comes or a defibrillator is available. \n\nDoctors or paramedics can also give special medicines called anti-arrhythmic medicines, which can make the heart start beating normally again. Some common anti-arrhythmic medicines are amiodarone and lidocaine. \n\nIf a person with ventricular fibrillation is treated right away, treatment is 90% successful (it works in 9 out of 10 people). But treatment gets 10% less successful after every minute (so if treatment starts after one minute, it will work in only 8 out of 10 people. After 5 minutes, it will work in only 4 out of 10 people.) So getting treatment as soon as possible is very important. If a person cannot be treated with medicine or a defibrillator right away, CPR will help keep blood and oxygen flowing through the person's body until treatment arrives. \n\nIn patients who are very likely to keep having ventricular fibrillation, a special defibrillator can be put into their chest by a surgeon. (This special defibrillator is called an \" implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. \" ) Any time the person goes into ventricular fibrillation, the defibrillator will give the person's heart an electric shock, to bring the heart back into a normal rhythm.", "timestamp": "2018-03-13T18:53:54Z", "text_length": 2580}

{"title": "Pulmonary hypertension", "parsed_text": "Pulmonary hypertension or PH is a condition where there is high blood pressure in the lungs. This condition makes it hard to breathe. Some people with the condition need extra oxygen. This condition can also make a person dizzy and become easily tired. Some people with the condition faint easily. The symptoms get worse when exercising or working hard. Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition, and it can be fatal. The condition makes it harder for the heart to pump blood. Because the heart has to work harder, it can also become sick. Some people who are very sick may need a lung transplant or a heart-lung transplant to live. Pulmonary hypertensions full name is pulmonary arterial hypertension even though most people call it pah, ph or pha. \n\nPeople with pulmonary hypertension have difficulty breathing. They also tire easily. Some of them faint easily too. They might have chest pain. Some patients have swelling of the feet and ankles. These symptoms get worse during exercise or hard work. \n\nBecause many diseases can make it hard to breathe, a doctor must learn about the patient's background. This helps the doctor to treat the patient, even if the patient has another disease. The doctor also does several tests. Pulmonary hypertension makes the heart sound different. One test is to measure the blood pressure inside the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that goes from the heart to the lungs. \n\nIn order to establish the cause, the physician will generally conduct a thorough medical history. A detailed family history is taken to determine whether the disease might be familial. A history of exposure to cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol leading to cirrhosis, and smoking leading to emphysema are considered significant. Physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension including a loud P2 (pulmonic valve closure sound), (para)sternal heave, jugular venous distension, pedal edema, ascites, hepatojugular reflux, clubbing etc. \n\nIn pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels in the lungs become too narrow. The blood pressure in the lungs becomes high. The heart works very hard to pump blood through the narrow blood vessels. Later on, the blood vessels in the lungs become hard and thick. The heart must work harder. \n\nThe heart can work so hard that it becomes sick. This is called heart failure. The sick heart cannot pump blood well. Less blood goes to the lungs, so the blood gets less oxygen. This makes it hard to breathe. This gets worse when exercising or working hard. \n\nThe most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure. This causes pulmonary venous hypertension. This leads to pulmonary edema, or fluid build-up in the lungs. \n\nMany illnesses can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). \n\nLung diseases that make the blood have less oxygen, such as: \n\n:chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD \n\n:interstitial lung disease \n\n:Pickwickian syndrome \n\nimmune system problems, such as: \n\n:AIDS \n\n:scleroderma \n\n:other autoimmune disorders \n\nliver problems \n\n:cirrhosis \n\n:portal hypertension \n\nother causes \n\n:sleep apnea \n\n:taking pills to lose weight, such as Fen-Phen, Aminorex, fenfluramine (Pondimin), and phentermine \n\n:sickle cell disease, \n\n:congenital heart disease \n\n:thyroid diseases, \n\n:taking drugs like cocaine \n\n:possibly Human herpesvirus 8 \n\nWhen a person has pulmonary hypertension without any other cause, this is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or IPAH. \n\nWhen a family history exists, the disease is termed familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, (FPAH). IPAH and FPAH are now considered to be genetic disorders linked to mutations in the BMPR2 gene, which encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins, as well as the 5-HT(2B) gene, which codes for a serotonin receptor. \n\nIn medicine, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery or lung vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of which are exacerbated by exertion. Depending on the cause, pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and right-sided heart failure. It was first identified by Dr Ernst von Romberg in 1891. It can be one of five different types, arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. \n\nAlthough the terms primary pulmonary hypertension (meaning of unknown cause) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (meaning due to another medical condition) still persist in materials disseminated to patients and the general public, these terms have largely been abandoned in the medical literature. This change has occurred because the older dichotomous classification did not reflect pathophysiology or outcome. It led to erroneous therapeutic decisions, i.e. treat \" primary \" pulmonary hypertension only. This in turn led to therapeutic nihilism for many patients labeled \" secondary \" pulmonary hypertension, and could have contributed to their deaths. The term \" primary pulmonary hypertension \" has now been replaced with \" idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension \" . The terms \" primary \" and \" secondary \" pulmonary hypertension should not be used any longer. Further details are in the Classification section below. \n\nThe most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure leading to pulmonary venous hypertension. This may be due to systolic or diastolic malfunction of the left ventricle or due to valvular dysfunction such as mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis. It usually manifests as pulmonary edema. \n\nCommon causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) include HIV, scleroderma and other autoimmune disorders, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, sickle cell disease, congenital heart disease, thyroid diseases, and others. Use of weight loss pills such as Fen-Phen, Aminorex, fenfluramine (Pondimin), and phentermine led to the development of PAH in the past. \n\nWhatever the initial cause, pulmonary hypertension involves the tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs, much as it is harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become both stiffer and thicker, further increasing the blood pressure within the lungs and impairing blood flow. In addition, the increased workload of the heart causes thickening and enlargement of the right ventricle, making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs, causing right heart failure. As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood. This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal. Therefore, it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity. \n\nBecause pulmonary hypertension can be of 5 major types, a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thomboembolic, or miscellaneous varieties. \n\nA physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension. These include altered heart sounds, such as a widely split S <sub> 2 </sub> or second heart sound, a loud P <sub> 2 </sub> or pulmonic valve closure sound (part of the second heart sound), (para)sternal heave, possible S <sub> 3 </sub> or third heart sound, and pulmonary regurgitation. Other signs include jugular venous distension (enlargement of the jugular veins), peripheral edema (swelling of the ankles and feet), ascites (abdominal swelling due to the accumulation of fluid), hepatojugular reflux, and clubbing. \n\nFurther procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses. These generally include pulmonary function tests, blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest (followed by high-resolution CT scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected), and ventilation-perfusion or V/Q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease. But lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure. Clinical improvement is often measured by a \" six-minute walk test \" , i.e. the distance a patient can walk in six minutes. Stability and improvement in this measurement correlate with better survival. \n\nAlthough pulmonary arterial pressure can be estimated on the basis of echocardiography, pressure sampling with a Swan-Ganz catheter provides the most definite measurement. PAOP and PVR can not be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires a cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure. \n\nNormal pulmonary arterial pressure in a person living at sea level has a mean value of 12 & ndash;16 mm Hg (1600 & ndash;2100 Pa). Definite pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pressures at rest exceed 25 mm Hg (3300 Pa). If mean pulmonary artery pressure rises above 30 mm Hg (4000 Pa) with exercise, that is also considered pulmonary hypertension. \n\nDiagnosis of PAH requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension with two other conditions. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP or PCWP) must be less than 15 mm Hg (2000 Pa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) must be greater than 3 Wood units (240 dyn\u2022s\u2022cm <sup> \u22125 </sup> or 2.4 mN\u2022s\u2022cm <sup> \u22125 </sup> ). \n\nIn 2003, the 3rd World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension was convened in Venice to modify the classification based on the new understanding of disease mechanisms. The revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension. \n\nThe system includes several improvements over the former 1998 Evian Classification system. Risk factor descriptions were updated, and the classification of congenital systemic-to pulmonary shunts was revised. A new classification of genetic factors in PH was recommended, but not implemented because available data were judged to be inadequate. \n\nThe Venice 2003 Revised Classification system can be summarized as follows: \n\nWHO Group I - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \n\nWHO Group II - Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease \n\nWHO Group III - Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia \n\nWHO Group IV - Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease \n\nWHO Group V - Miscellaneous \n\nThe terms primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PPH and SPH) were formerly used to classify the disease. This led to the assumption that only the primary disease should be treated, and the secondary variety should be ignored in favor of treating only the underlying illness. In fact all forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension are treatable. Unfortunately, this classification system still persists in the minds of many physicians, and probably leads to many patients with being denied treatment. This nihilistic approach to pulmonary arterial hypertension may also contribute to underdiagnosis. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 patients with PAH in the US, but only 15-20,000 have been diagnosed. Many others have been misdiagnosed as COPD, asthma, or congestive heart failure. \n\nThe term primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has now been replaced with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) in much of the medical literature. However, some physicians continue to use the older classification inappropriately. \n\nIPAH is a rare disease with an incidence of about 2-3 per million per year and a prevalence of about 15 per million. Women are almost three times as likely to present with IPAH than men. \n\nOther forms of PAH are far more common. In scleroderma the incidence has been estimated to be 6 to 60% of all patients, in rheumatoid arthritis up to 21%, in systemic lupus erythematosus 4 to 14%, in portal hypertension between 2 and 5%, in HIV about 0.5%, and in sickle cell disease ranging from 20 to 40%. \n\nDiet pills such as Fen-Phen produced an annual incidence of 25-50 per million per year. \n\nTreatment is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. Since pulmonary venous hypertension is synonymous with congestive heart failure, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, etc., or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve. \n\nIn PAH, lifestyle changes, digoxin, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, and oxygen therapy are considered conventional therapy, but have never been proven to be beneficial in a randomized, prospective manner. \n\nHigh dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. \n\nThree major pathways are involved in abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth-muscle cells of the pulmonary artery in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. These pathways correspond to important therapeutic targets in this condition and play a role in determining which of three classes of drugs\u2014endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives\u2014will be used. \n\nProstacyclin (prostaglandin I <sub> 2 </sub> ) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin, marketed as Flolan\u00ae) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Flolan\u00ae is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous (24/7), and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil (Remodulin\u00ae) can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. Iloprost (Ilomedin\u00ae) is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost (marketed as Ventavis\u00ae) is the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe. This form of administration has the advantage of selective deposition in the lungs with less systemic side effects. \n\nThe dual (ET <sub> A </sub> and ET <sub> B </sub> ) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (marketed as Tracleer\u00ae) was approved in 2001. Two selective endothelin receptor antagonists (ET <sub> A </sub> only) are in the final stages of approval: sitaxsentan and ambrisentan. Sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), was approved for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio\u00ae. Tadalafil (currently marketed as Cialis\u00ae for erectile dysfunction) is currently is Phase III trials. Vasoactive intestinal peptide by inhalation should enter clinical trials for PAH in 2007. PRX-08066 is a serotonin antagonist currently being developed for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. \n\nAtrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxia). It is best performed in experienced centers. Lung transplantation cures pulmonary arterial hypertension, but leaves the patient with the complications of transplantation, and a survival of about 5 years. \n\nPulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a large and very difficult procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers. Case series show remarkable success in most patients. \n\nTreatment for hypoxic and miscellaneous varieties of pulmonary hypertension have not been established. However, studies of several agents are currently enrolling patients. Many physicians will treat these diseases with the same medications as for PAH, until better options become available. \n\nThe NIH IPAH registry from the 1980s showed an untreated median survival of 2\u20133 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale). Although this figure is widely quoted, it is probably irrelevant today. Outcomes have changed dramatically over the last two decades. This may be because of newer drug therapy, better overall care, and earlier diagnosis (lead time bias). A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer\u00ae) showed that 86% patients were alive at 3 years. With multiple agents now available, combination therapy is increasingly used. Impact of these agents on survival is not known, since many of them have been developed only recently. It would not be unreasonable to expect median survival to extend past 10 years in the near future. \n\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy: Pulmonary Hypertension \n\nPH Central - the internet resource for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension \n\nThe Pulmonary Hypertension Association Webpage provided by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association \n\nFacts About Primary Pulmonary Hypertension from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) \n\nWebcast: The Changing World of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Therapies - American College of CHEST Physicians \n\nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension Information for Healthcare professionals \n\n& site=gt & id=8888891 & key=5icobVrQbc8YX & gry= & fcn=y & fw=Kdeo & filename=/profiles/pph/index.html BMPR2-Related Primary Pulmonary Hypertension on GeneReviews \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-05-22T11:16:24Z", "text_length": 21348}

{"title": "Hepatitis C", "parsed_text": "Hepatitis C is an infection that mostly affects the liver. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes this disease. Often, a person with Hepatitis C does not have any symptoms (health problems or signs that he has the disease). However, chronic infection can scar the liver. Many years of infection may cause cirrhosis. Sometimes, people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer. They can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach. The blood loss from this problem can kill. \n\nHepatitis C is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact (when blood from a person with Hepatitis C contacts (touches or gets into) another person's bloodstream). The most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use (when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins, with a needle that was already used by a person infected with Hepatitis C); nonsterile medical equipment (medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person); and blood transfusions (when a person is given blood that came from an infected person). \n\nAround the world, about 130\u2013170 million people have Hepatitis C. Scientists began studying the Hepatitis C virus in the 1970s, and in 1989 they proved that the virus exists. As far as scientists know, this virus does not cause disease in any animals other than humans. \n\nThe medications that are normally used to treat Hepatitis C are called peginterferon and ribavirin. Between 50-80% of people who are treated (or 5 to 8 out of every 10) are cured. However, if a person's Hepatitis C has progressed (or gotten worse) so much that the person has cirrhosis or liver cancer, the person might need a liver transplant (they might need to have surgery where they are given another person's liver, or part of another person's liver). This makes it possible for the person to survive, but the Hepatitis C virus usually comes back after the transplant. There is no vaccine that works to prevent people from getting Hepatitis C. \n\nHepatitis C causes acute symptoms (symptoms that begin quickly or last only a short time) in just 15% of people with the disease. More often, infected people have symptoms that are mild (not serious) and vague (not very specific), like a decreased appetite (not feeling like eating), fatigue (feeling tired), nausea (feeling like throwing up), pain in the muscles or joints, and losing weight. Every once in a while, an infected person may get jaundice (where a person's skin turns yellow, a sign that their liver is not working quite right). If it is not treated, Hepatitis C goes away by itself in 10-50% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 10). This happens more often in young women than in other infected people. \n\nEighty percent (or 8 out of every 10) of people exposed to the Hepatitis C virus get a chronic infection (one that does not get better and lasts for a long time). Most experience very few or no symptoms during the first decades of the infection, although chronic Hepatitis C can cause fatigue (feeling tired). But in people who have been infected for many years, Hepatitis C can cause serious problems, like cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C leads to cirrhosis in 10\u201330% (between 10 and 30 out of every 100) of people who have been infected over 30 years. People with Hepatitis C are more likely to get cirrhosis if they are men; if they are alcoholics; or if they also have Hepatitis B or HIV. Cirrhosis can cause serious problems on its own, but it also makes people more likely to get other serious illnesses. For example, people who get cirrhosis are twenty times more likely to get liver cancer (with about 1-3% getting liver cancer every year). People with Hepatitis C who are alcoholics are even more likely - 100 times more likely - to get liver cancer. Among people in general, 27% of all cases of cirrhosis, and 25% of all cases of liver cancer, are caused by Hepatitis C. \n\nCirrhosis of the liver can cause many different symptoms. Some of these symptoms are high blood pressure in the veins that travel to the liver; a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, called ascites; easy bruising or bleeding; veins becoming larger than normal, especially in the stomach and esophagus; jaundice (a yellowing of the skin); and brain damage. \n\nHepatitis C can also cause some rare problems (problems which do not happen very often), which affect parts of the body outside of the liver. One rare problem that Hepatitis C can cause is Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder (or a disorder where the body's system of defenses attacks itself). Hepatitis C can also cause a lower-than-normal number of blood platelets (the part of the blood which causes blood to clot; without enough platelets, a person can have bleeding problems, or can start bleeding and be unable to stop. Other rare problems that Hepatitis C can cause are chronic (long-lasting) skin disease; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (a type of cancer); and diabetes (where a person's body does not make or use enough insulin, an important hormone that controls the level of sugar in the blood). \n\nHepatitis C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the scientific system that names and organizes viruses, the Hepatitis C virus is part of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. There are seven major types of HCV, called \" genotypes \" . In the United States, the first genotype of HCV causes 70% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 7 out of every 10); the second genotype causes 20% (or 2 out of every 10); and each of the other genotypes causes 1% (or 1 out of every 100 cases). Thr first genotype is also the most common in South America and Europe. \n\nIn the developed world, the most common way that people get Hepatitis C is through intravenous drug use (by shooting drugs into a vein, using a needle that was already used by a person who has Hepatitis C). In the developing world, most people get Hepatitis C through blood transfusions (being given blood that was taken from a person with Hepatitis C) or by getting medical care with tools that were not cleaned enough after being used on a person with Hepatitis C. In 20% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 1 in every 5 cases), it is not known what caused the infection, but many of these cases are thought to have been caused by intravenous drug use. \n\nIn many parts of the world, intravenous (IV) drug use (shooting drugs into a vein using a needle) is a major risk factor for Hepatitis C (meaning that it makes people more likely to get the disease). One study that looked at 77 countries showed that in 25 of these countries (including the United States), between 60% and 80% (or 6 to 8 out of every 10) of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. and China. In twelve of the countries in the study, more than 80% of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. Across the world, as many as ten million IV drug users are thought to have Hepatitis C; the highest totals are in China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million). Studies have also shown that in places where there are high numbers of IV drug users, people are more likely to have Hepatitis C. For example, prisoners in the United States are ten to twenty times more likely than the general population (people in general) to have Hepatitis C. This is thought to be because prisoners are more likely to things that put them at high risk for getting Hepatitis C, like using IV drugs and getting tattoos with tools that have not been cleaned properly. \n\nPeoples are at risk for getting Hepatitis C if they get blood transfusions (where a person is given blood from another person), blood products (which have blood or parts of blood in them), or organ transplants (where a person who needs a new organ is given an organ from another person), if these things have not been screened (or tested) for the Hepatitis C virus. In the United States, there has been universal screening - meaning that all blood and organs are tested before being given to another person - since 1992. Before then, about one out of every 200 units of blood carried the Hepatitis C virus; since 1992, only one in 10,000 to 10,000,000 units of blood carry the virus. The reason that there is still a low risk, instead of no risk at all, is that a person's blood does not test positive for the Hepatitis C virus until about 11\u201370 days after they get the disease. So every once in a while, the screening tests may not pick up on a person's infection if the person got Hepatitis C less than 11\u201370 days before giving blood. While Hepatitis C screening works very well, some countries still do not screen blood and organ donations for the disease because of the cost. \n\nSometimes, a healthcare worker will accidentally get stuck with a needle that was used on a person with Hepatitis C. If this happens, the healthcare worker has a small chance - about a 1.8% chance - of becoming infected. The worker is more likely to get infected if the needle they were stuck with was hollow, or if the needle stuck deeply into their skin It is also possible for the Hepatitis C virus to spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's blood; however, the risk of this happening is low. The virus cannot be spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's intact skin (skin that is whole and not damaged, with no wounds). \n\nHepatitis C can also be transmitted (or spread) through hospital equipment that has not been cleaned enough after being used on an infected person. Hepatitis C can be spread through needles, syringes, and medication vials (or containers) that are re-used; through infusion bags (which are used to pump medications into a person's body; and through surgical equipment that is not sterile (or clean and free of germs). In Egypt, which has the highest rate of infection in the world, medical and dental facilities with poor standards of care and cleanliness are the most common reason that Hepatitis C spreads. \n\nScientists do not know whether Hepatitis C can be transmitted (or spread) through sex. Hepatitis C is more likely in people who have high-risk sexual activity (sexual actions which make them much more likely to get Hepatitis C). However, it is not known whether this is because of these people's sexual behavior, or because these people were also using IV drugs. There does not seem to be any risk that Hepatitis C can be spread through sexual contact between a heterosexual couple (a man and a woman; commonly called a \" straight \" couple) if neither person has sex with anyone else. There does seem to be a risk of Hepatitis C spreading if one person already has a sexually transmitted infection, like HIV or genital ulceration; or if two people have sex in a way that causes wounds to the lining of the anal canal (like anal penetration - one person putting his penis into another person's anus). The United States government says that most people need to use condoms to protect themselves from getting Hepatitis C only if they have more than one sexual partner. \n\nPeople who get tattoos are about two to three times more likely to get Hepatitis C. This can be because of tools that are not sterile (not clean or free of germs), or because the dyes used for tattooing are contaminated (the Hepatitis C virus has gotten inside of them). \n\nTattoos or body piercings that were done before the mid-1980s or by people who are not professionals (not experts) are especially likely to spread Hepatitis C, since they are more likely to have used tools that were not sterile. Bigger tattoos also seem to put a person at more risk of getting Hepatitis C. The risk of getting Hepatitis C is very high in prisons; in the United States, almost half of all prison inmates share tattooing tools that are not sterile. However, if a tattoo is done in a licensed place of business (which has to follow rules about cleaning tools and preventing diseases from spreading), there is almost no risk of getting Hepatitis C from the tattoo. \n\nBecause Hepatitis C is spread by blood-to-blood contact, personal-care tools which come into contact with blood - like razors, toothbrushes, and manicure or pedicure equipment or any other kind of blood to blood contact - can spread the disease if they are shared. To prevent the spread of Hepatitis C, people should be careful with cuts, sores, or anything else that causes bleeding. Hepatitis C does not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils. \n\nAlthough this does not happen very often, a pregnant woman who has Hepatitis C can give the disease to her baby when it is born, or to her fetus while she is pregnant. This happens in less than 10% of all pregnancies (less than 1 out of every 10 pregnancies). If a pregnant woman has Hepatitis C, nothing can be done to make her less likely to give her baby the disease. If the woman is in labor (the process of delivering her baby) for a long time, there is more of a chance that the baby will become infected during the birth. Breastfeeding does not seem to spread the disease. However, doctors say that an infected mother should not breastfeed if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or her viral loads (the amount of the Hepatitis C virus in her blood) are high. \n\nThere are a few different tests that can diagnose Hepatitis C (or say for sure that a person has the disease). These tests are called HCV antibody, ELISA, Western blot, and quantitative HCV RNA tests. A technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can show that a person has Hepatitis C virus RNA (part of the virus's genetic blueprint) one to two weeks after the person becomes infected. Tests that look for Hepatitis C antibodies (which the body makes to fight the disease) cannot be done this quickly after infection, because the antibodies can take much longer to form and show up. \n\nA person has chronic Hepatitis C if he has been infected with the Hepatitis C virus for more than six months. Because people with chronic Hepatitis C often have no symptoms for decades, doctors often diagnose it through liver function tests (which test how well the liver is working) or by doing routine (regular) screening of high-risk people. Tests cannot tell whether an infection is acute or chronic. \n\nHepatitis C testing usually begins with blood tests that look for antibodies to the Hepatitis C virus, using a technique called an enzyme immunoassay. If this test is positive (showing that the body is making antibodies to fight the Hepatitis C virus), the person will be tested a second time to make sure that the results are correct and to see how serious the infection is. The results are confirmed using a technique called a recombinant immunoblot assay, and an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction shows how serious the infection is. If the immunoblot is positive, but there are no Hepatitis C virus RNA, this shows that the person had an infection, but it cleared up either with treatment or on its own. If the immunoblot is negative, this shows that the immunoassay (the first test) was wrong, and the person does not have Hepatitis C. It takes six to eight weeks after a person gets infected before the immunoassay will test positive. \n\nDuring the first part of a Hepatitis C infection, a person's liver enzymes may change; on average, they begin to rise seven weeks after infection. A person's liver enzymes usually do not affect how severe their infection is. \n\nA test called a liver biopsy can show whether a person's liver has been damaged, or how badly it has been damaged, by Hepatitis C. However, there are some risks from the procedure. In a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece out of the patient's liver so that he can test it. There are three major changes to the liver that a biopsy usually shows. One is that lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) show up in the liver tissue. Another is that lymphoid follicles (small masses or swellings) show up in the portal triad, a part of the liver. The third is changes to the bile ducts (these carry bile, which is made in the liver and is needed to help a person digest their food, to other parts of the body). Many blood tests are available which try to measure how much damage there is to a patient's liver, in order to avoid the need for a biopsy and its risks. \n\nAs few as 5\u201350% of infected people in the United States and Canada (or 5 to 50 out of every 100) know that they have Hepatitis C. Doctors suggest that people who are at high risk for the disease, including people with tattoos, should get tested. Screening is also suggested for people with elevated (high) liver enzymes, since this is often the only sign that a person has chronic hepatitis. Routine screening (testing everyone) is not recommended in the United States. \n\nAs of 2012, there is no vaccine that works to prevent Hepatitis C. Researchers are working on vaccines, are some are making progress. The spread of Hepatitis C can be prevented by using a combination of strategies, like needle exchange programs (where IV drug users can get clean needles which will not spread the virus) and treatment for drug abuse. If these strategies are used together, the risk of IV drug users getting Hepatitis C drops by about 75%. At a national level - within each country - screening blood donors is important for preventing the spread of Hepatitis C. So is using universal precautions in healthcare facilities. (This means that healthcare workers treat every patient as if he has Hepatitis C, and they always wear gloves, clean their equipment properly, and keep things sterile so that diseases cannot be spread.) In countries that do not have enough sterile syringes to use a new needle for every patient, healthcare providers should give medications orally (by mouth) rather than via injection (using a needle) so that needles do not have to be re-used. \n\nThe Hepatitis C virus causes chronic infection in 50\u201380% of infected persons (or 5 to 8 out of every 10). About 40-80% of these cases (or 4 to 8 out of 10) clear up with treatment. Although this almost never happens, chronic Hepatitis C can sometimes clear up on its own, without treatment. Doctors suggest that people with chronic Hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and taking medications that can be toxic (or poisonous) to the liver. They also suggest that people with chronic infections should be given vaccines for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. People with cirrhosis should also have ultrasound tests for liver cancer. \n\nIf a person has liver abnormalities (changes in the liver that are not normal) due to Hepatitis C virus infection, the person should get treatment. The first treatment that is used is a drug called pegylated interferon given together with the antiviral (virus-killing) drug ribavirin. These medications are given for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on what type of Hepatitis C virus the person has. About 50\u201360% of people who are treated improve. For people with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1, treatment may work even better if another medication - either boceprevir or telaprevir - is given along with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa. Side effects with treatment are common; half of people treated get flu-like symptoms, and a third have emotional problems. Treatment works better if it is given during the first six months than after Hepatitis C becomes chronic. If a person gets a new infection and it has not cleared up after eight to twelve weeks, doctors usually suggest giving pegylated interferon for another 24 weeks. For people with thalassemia (a blood disorder), ribavirin appears to be a helpful treatment, but it makes it more likely for patients to need blood transfusions (where they need to be given blood from another person). \n\nSome supporters of alternative medicine say that alternative therapies like milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver can be helpful for Hepatitis C. However, there is no proof that any alternative therapy has any effect on the Hepatitis C virus. \n\nPeople respond differently to treatment, depending on which of the Hepatitis C virus genotypes they have. About 40-50% in people with genotype 1 have a good, stable response with 8\u201348 weeks of treatment. In people with genotypes 2 and 3, about 70-80% have a good, stable response with 24 weeks of treatment. About 65% of people with genotype 4 have a good, stable response with 48 weeks of treatment. There is not much evidence about how well treatment works for people with genotype 6 disease is currently sparse. The evidence that does exist looks at results after 48 weeks of treatment at the same medication doses as people with genotype 1. \n\nBetween 130 and 170 million people, or about 3% of all of the people in the world, are living with chronic Hepatitis C. Between 3\u20134 million people get infected per year. More than 350,000 people die every year from diseases caused by Hepatitis C. The numbers of people getting Hepatitis C have increased a lot in the 20th century for a few different reasons. More people are using IV drugs. Also, more people are getting medical care with medical equipment that is not sterile, and it is more common for medications to be given intravenously. \n\nIn the United States, about 2% of people have hepatitis C, with 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year. Rates have decreased in the West since the 1990s due to improved blood screening before transfusion. Annual deaths from HCV in the United States range from 8,000 to 10,000. Expectations are that this mortality rate will increase as people infected by transfusion before HCV testing become ill and die. \n\nInfection rates are higher in some countries in Africa and Asia. Countries with very high rates of infection include Egypt (22%), Pakistan (4.8%) and China (3.2%). The high rate in Egypt is linked to a now-discontinued mass-treatment campaign for schistosomiasis, using improperly sterilized glass syringes. \n\nIn the mid-1970s, Harvey J. Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his research team demonstrated that most post-blood transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or B viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Dr. D.W. Bradley from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a new molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test. In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of non A non B hepatitis specimens. In April 1989, the discovery of HCV was published in two articles in the journal Science. The discovery led to significant improvements in diagnosis and improved antiviral treatment. In 2000, Drs. Alter and Houghton were honored with the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for \n\n\" pioneering work leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C and the development of screening methods that reduced the risk of blood transfusion-associated hepatitis in the U.S. from 30% in 1970 to virtually zero in 2000. \" \n\nChiron filed for several patents on the virus and its diagnosis. A competing patent application by the CDC was dropped in 1990 after Chiron paid $1.9 million to the CDC and $337,500 to Bradley. In 1994, Bradley sued Chiron, seeking to invalidate the patent, have himself included as a coinventor, and receive damages and royalty income. He dropped the suit in 1998 after losing before an appeals court. \n\nThe World Hepatitis Alliance coordinates World Hepatitis Day, held every year on July 28. The economic costs of hepatitis C are significant both to the individual and to society. In the United States the average lifetime cost of the disease was estimated at 33,407 USD in 2003, with the cost of a liver transplant approximately 200,000 USD as of 2011. In Canada the cost of a course of antiviral treatment was as high as 30,000 CAD in 2003, while the United States costs are between 9,200 and 17,600 in 1998 USD. In many areas of the world people are unable to afford treatment with antivirals because they lack insurance coverage or the insurance they have will not pay for antivirals. \n\nAs of 2011, about one hundred medications are in development for hepatitis C. These medicines include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors. These potentially new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T16:21:19Z", "text_length": 29087}

{"title": "Jaundice", "parsed_text": "Jaundice (also called icterus) is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color. People with jaundice have a problem with their liver, which stops it from removing heme properly. Heme (from hemoglobin) changes to a chemical called bilirubin after red blood cell death. Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin. Jaundice is common in newly born babies. It usually starts the second day after birth. \n\nJaundice can also be caused by other diseases, like malaria, hepatitis, or gallstones. \n\nJaundice is the most common of all liver problems. The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood. \n\nThe bile, made by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition. It also stops decaying changes in food. If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products. Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant. \n\nThere are three types of jaundice: \n\nhaemolytic jaundice - caused by destruction of red blood cells. This causes increased bilirubin formation and anaemia \n\nobstructive jaundice - caused by a blockage in the pathway where bilirubin is made in the liver cells and where bile goes into the duodenum \n\nhepatocellular jaundice - caused by damage to liver cells. The damage could be from a viral infection or toxic drugs. \n\nYellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes happens in all types of jaundice. \n\nThe symptoms of jaundice are: \n\nextreme weakness \n\nheadache \n\nfever \n\nloss of appetite \n\ntiredness \n\nsevere constipation \n\nnausea \n\nyellow coloration of the eyes, tongue, skin and urine. \n\ndull pain in the liver region. \n\nObstructive jaundice may also cause intense itching. \n\nJaundice is a sign that the liver is not working.

{"title": "Alcoholism", "parsed_text": "Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol. People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics. \n\nAlcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated. \n\nAlcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism. \n\nAlcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed. \n\nBeing an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking. \n\nTo be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year: \n\nThey feel like they have to drink alcohol. \n\nThey cannot control when they start. drinking; when they stop drinking; or how much they drink. \n\nThey get alcohol withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking. \n\nThey have to drink more and more alcohol to feel drunk (this is called tolerance). \n\nThey spend less time doing things they used to enjoy, because they are spending so much time drinking. They spend a lot of time getting alcohol, drinking alcohol, or feeling sick from drinking too much. \n\nThey keep drinking even though they know it is causing serious problems in their life. \n\nThere is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person may be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers). \n\nAlcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause: \n\nBrain damage \n\nLiver disease (like cirrhosis) and liver failure \n\nMany types of cancer, including mouth, throat, esophageal, breast, and liver cancers \n\nHeart problems, including a weak heart muscle; abnormal heartbeat; high blood pressure; and stroke \n\nProblems with the pancreas \n\nA weak immune system, which makes it harder for the body to fight off diseases \n\nDepression and anxiety \n\nDeaths from drunk driving accidents or other injuries \n\nIf a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death. \n\nIn 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use. \n\nAlcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include: \n\nNot doing well at school or work \n\nHaving family problems \n\nNot having enough money, because the alcoholic is spending so much money on alcohol \n\nBeing unemployed \n\nAbusing or neglecting their children \n\nAbusing their wives or husbands \n\nLiving in poverty or being homeless \n\nIf an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal. \n\nThe most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called \" DTs \" ). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them. \n\nThis does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking. \n\nIn 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics. \n\nPeople in developed countries drink the most alcohol. <sup> p.4 </sup> \n\nAlcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Here is a list of all the areas in the world. It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common: <sup> p.21 </sup> \n\nThe European area \n\nThe Americas \n\nThe Western Pacific area (including China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and many islands in the Pacific Ocean) \n\nThe Southeast Asian area \n\nAfrica \n\nThe Eastern Mediterranean area (including the Middle East and northeast Africa) \n\nThere are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world. <sup> p.4 </sup> These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to. <sup> p.4 </sup> In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal. \n\nHowever, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas. \n\nAlcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased. \n\nFemale alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives. \n\nIn the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics. <sup> p.21 </sup> \n\nIn many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries. <sup> p.10 </sup> \n\nAlcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism. \n\nDetoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. \" Detoxification \" means \" getting toxins out of the body. \" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more. \n\nIt is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called \" detoxes \" or \" rehabs. \" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines. <sup> p.35 </sup> \n\nOnce a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called sober. Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober. \n\nPsychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober. For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to: \n\nDeal with stress without using alcohol \n\nFigure out what makes them want to drink, and learn how to deal with those things without drinking \n\nPlan what they will do if they are around people who are drinking \n\nCome up with reasons for why they want to stay sober, and use those things as motivation to stay sober (this is called Motivational Interviewing) \n\nChange their thoughts about drinking and how they react to those thoughts (this is called Cognitive-behavioral therapy) \n\nSome medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include: <sup> pp.130-144 </sup> \n\nAntabuse: This medication makes a person very sick if they drink any alcohol. It can make an alcoholic not want to drink any more, because they do not want to get sick. \n\nNaltrexone: This medication causes changes in the brain. These changes make alcoholics not want to drink alcohol as much as they normally do. Also, if an alcoholic does drink alcohol, the naltrexone will block the alcohol from making them feel good, and they are more likely to stop drinking. \n\nMany alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed. <sup> p.144 </sup> \n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program. This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused. \n\nThere are also other groups for alcoholics, like: \n\nSMART Recovery \n\nSecular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) \n\nWomen for Sobriety \n\nLifeRing Secular Recovery \n\nCelebrate Recovery (based on Christianity and the Bible) \n\nAddiction \n\nDrunkenness \n\nFetal alcohol syndrome \n\nCIWA scale (used to measure how bad alcohol withdrawal is) \n\nCAGE questionnaire (used to test adults for alcoholism) \n\nCRAFFT Screening Test (used to test teenagers for alcohol and drug problems) \n\nFact sheets about alcohol (from the United States Centers for Disease Control) \n\nInformation about alcohol for kids (from KidsHealth.org) \n\nInformation about alcohol for teenagers (from GirlsHealth.gov) \n\nNational Substance Abuse Hotline - find help for alcoholism, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (run by SAMHSA.gov) \n\nTreatment for Alcohol Problems: Finding and Getting Help (by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism) \n\nGroups for alcoholics and their families \n\nAlcoholics Anonymous \n\nAl-Anon (support group for people who have an alcoholic family member) \n\nAlateen (support group for teenagers who have an alcoholic family member) \n\nSMART Recovery \n\nSecular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) \n\nWomen for Sobriety \n\nLifeRing Secular Recovery \n\nCelebrate Recovery", "timestamp": "2020-03-30T23:26:25Z", "text_length": 12215}

{"title": "Common cold", "parsed_text": " \n\nThe common cold (also known as nasopharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, acute coryza, or a cold) is an easily spread infectious disease of the upper respiratory system. It damages mostly the nose and throat. The symptoms include cough, painful throat, runny nose (rhinorrhea), and fever. These symptoms usually last seven to ten days, but sometimes up to three weeks. Over two hundred different viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common cause. \n\nAcute infections of the nose, sinuses, throat or larynx (upper respiratory tract infections, URI or URTI) are sorted by the areas of the body that are mostly hurt. The common cold mostly hurts the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and sinusitis the sinuses. The symptoms come from the immune system's response to the infection, not from direct destruction by the viruses themselves. Hand washing is the main way to keep the common cold from happening. Wearing face masks might also help. \n\nThere is no cure for the common cold, but the symptoms can be treated. It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. The average person gets two to three colds every year. The average child gets between 6 and 12 colds every year. These colds have been with humans for thousands of years. \n\nThe most common symptoms of a cold are a cough, runny nose, a stuffy nose, and a sore throat. Other issues are sore muscles, feeling tired, headache, and not wanting to eat. Around 40% of people with colds have a sore throat, while around 50% have a cough. Muscle ache happens in about half of the cases. A fever is an uncommon symptom in adults, but it is common in infants and young children. The cough caused by a cold is usually mild compared to a cough caused by influenza (the flu). A cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of the flu in adults. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in no symptoms. The color of the mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways (sputum) may vary in color from clear to yellow to green. This color does not indicate if an infection is caused by viruses or bacteria. \n\nA cold usually begins with feeling tired, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache. Additional symptoms such as runny nose and cough follow within two or more days. Symptoms typically reach their worst two to three days after the infection begins. Symptoms usually end after seven to ten days, but can last up to three weeks. The cough lasts for more than ten days in 35% to 40% of cases involving children. It lasts for more than 25 days in 10% of cases involving children. \n\nThe common cold is an easily spread infection of the upper respiratory tract. The rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold. It accounts for 30% to 80% of all cases. A rhinovirus is an RNA-containing virus of the family Picornaviridae. There are 99 known types of viruses in this family of viruses. \n\nOther viruses can also cause the common cold. The Coronavirus causes 10% to 15% of cases. The flu causes 5% to 15% of cases. Other cases may be caused by human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, Enteroviruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently, more than one virus is present and causing the infection. In total, over two hundred different viruses[k2] are associated with colds. \n\nThe common cold virus is usually spread in one of two main ways. By breathing or swallowing droplets in the air containing the virus; or by contacting infected nasal mucus or contaminated objects. The most common method of transmitting the cold virus has not been determined. The viruses may survive for a long time in the environment. Viruses may then be transmitted from the hands to the eyes or nose where infection occurs. People sitting close together appear at greater risk of becoming infected. Transmission is common in day cares and at schools, due to the closeness of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to other members of the family. There is no evidence that the air on commercial flights transmits cold viruses. Rhinoviruses are most infectious in the first three days of cold symptoms. They are much less infectious afterwards. \n\nThe traditional theory was that the disease spread to someone staying too long in cold weather, rain, or winter conditions. This is how the disease got its name. The role of body cooling as a risk factor for the common cold is controversial. Some common cold viruses are seasonal, found more often in cold or wet weather. This is believed to mostly be due to more time spent indoors, close to each other; specifically children returning to school. Still, changes in the respiratory system may result in easier infections. Dry air may increase transmission rates by allowing small easily spread droplets to spread farther and stay in the air longer. \n\nHerd immunity, immunity that occurs when an entire group of people become immune to a particular infection, occurs from previous exposure to cold viruses. Thus younger populations have greater rates of respiratory infections and older populations have lower rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is also a risk factor for disease. Lack of sleep and poor nutrition have also been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure. This is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. \n\nThe symptoms of the common cold are believed to be mostly related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus-specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact. It binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown methods to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. \n\nIn contrast, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is contacted by both direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. \n\nHuman parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and airways. In young children, when it affects the trachea it may produce croup, a hoarse cough and difficulty breathing. This is due to the small size of the airway in children. \n\nThe distinction between different upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is loosely based on the location of the symptoms. The common cold primarily affects the nose, pharyngitis primarily affects the throat, and bronchitis primarily affects the lungs. The common cold is frequently defined as inflammation of the nose and may include varying amounts of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is common. Isolation of the actual viral agent involved is rarely performed. It is generally not possible to identify the specific virus through symptoms. \n\nThe only effective way to prevent the common cold is by physically preventing the spread of the viruses. This primarily includes hand washing and wearing face masks. In the health care environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also worn. Isolating infected individuals is not possible because the disease is so widespread and symptoms are not specific. Vaccination has proved difficult because there are so many viruses involved and the viruses undergo rapid change. Developing a broadly effective vaccine is very unlikely. \n\nRegular hand washing reduces the spread of cold viruses. It is most effective and is especially recommended for use in children, due to a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of over-the-counter cold medicines for children, and due to the risk for harm from those medicines. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years old and younger due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. \n\nIn adults, the symptoms of a runny nose can be reduced by first-generation antihistamines. However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with adverse side effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are also effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose, but there is little effect on stuffiness. Second-generation antihistamines do not appear to be effective. \n\nDue to the lack of studies, it is not known whether drinking more fluids improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. A similar lack of data exists for the use of heated humidified air. One study found chest vapor rub to be effective in providing some symptomatic relief of night-time cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty. \n\nAntibiotics have no effect against viral infections and thus have no effect against the common cold. Antibiotics are often prescribed even though antibiotic side effects cause overall harm. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed because people expect doctors to prescribe them, and doctors want to help people. Prescribing antibiotics also happens because it is difficult to exclude causes of infection that may be managed by antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold, even though some preliminary research has shown benefit. \n\nWhile there are many alternative treatments used for the common cold, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of most treatments. As of 2010, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against either honey or nasal irrigation. Zinc supplements may reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when taken within 24 hours of their onset. The effect of vitamin C on the common cold, while extensively researched, is disappointing. Evidence about the usefulness of echinacea is inconsistent. Different types of echinacea supplements may vary in their effectiveness. \n\nThe common cold is generally mild and goes away on its own with most symptoms improving in one week. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system). Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% of cases. Ear infections occur in 30% of cases. \n\nThe common cold is the most common human disease and people are affected all around the world. Adults typically have two to five infections per year. Children may have six to ten colds per year (and up to twelve colds per year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to a weakening immune system. \n\nWhile the cause of the common cold has been known since only the 1950s, the disease has been with humanity since ancient times. Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BC. The name \" common cold \" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946, and it was here that the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection provided some protection against the disease. No practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds. Zinc was the only successful treatment developed in the history of the CCU. \n\nThe economic impact of the common cold is poorly understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75 million to 100 million physician visits annually, costing at least $7.7 billion per year (by conservative cost estimates). Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Americans spend an additional $400 million on prescription medicines for symptomatic relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription. The use of antibiotic prescriptions has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22 million to 189 million school days are missed each year due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States. \n\nA number of antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold. As of 2009, none have been both found effective and licensed for use. There are ongoing trials of the antiviral drug pleconaril. It shows promise against picornaviruses. There are also ongoing trials of BTA-798. The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied. \n\nResearchers from the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison have mapped the genome for all known virus strains that cause the common cold. \n\nFindDocTV - Fly while Having a Cold", "timestamp": "2020-03-26T06:31:29Z", "text_length": 17268}

It can also be spread by sexual contact, reuse of needles, and transfusions of blood with the virus in it. \n\nInfection with hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, where an injection is given which makes the body immune to the virus. It is recommended that all people are given a series of three vaccines over a few months when they are babies to ensure good protection against this virus. However, vaccination only provides 90% protection, it does not completely remove the risk of infection. \n\nSome people who are infected are able to beat the virus quickly. Many people are infected for life. Usually they have few or no symptoms. Sometimes the liver is damaged severely, causing liver failure. A common symptom of liver failure is jaundice, where the person's skin and eyes turn yellow due to a build-up of body products which would normally be filtered by the liver. Another problem with hepatitis B is that it can cause cancer of the liver. \n\nBlood tests can find signs that the liver is being damaged. If people have those signs, treatment for hepatitis B can prevent the liver damage caused by the virus. Antiviral medications are given, which prevent the virus from making copies of itself. However, once the virus is in the liver, it is not possible to get rid of the virus completely. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-02-08T13:49:41Z", "text_length": 2407}

{"title": "Haemophilia", "parsed_text": "Haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop. The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot. People with hemophilia lack proteins in the blood that make scabs and blood clots. A person with a small cut or internal bleed (bruise) could bleed to death. They do not bleed more than a normal person, but they bleed for much longer. The word comes from the Greek words haima ( \" blood \" ) and philia ( \" to love \" ). To treat this, an affected person can get a blood donation from someone without hemophilia. The donor\u2019s blood has the clotting proteins and can temporarily make a normal scab. 30% of hemophilia A and B cases are the first person in their family to have hemophilia which is the result of an unexpected mutation (this means that there is an unexpected change in the body). \n\nIt usually affects males. It is passed from mother to child through genes. \n\nThere are 3 types of haemophilia: \n\nHaemophilia A - about 90% of cases. There is no blood clotting ability. \n\nHaemophilia B - not as severe, but much less common. There is not enough blood clotting ability. \n\nHaemophilia C - caused by not one, but two recessive (weak) genes. \n\nHaemophilia A happens in about 1 in 5,000\u201310,000 male births. Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 20,000\u201334,000 male births. \n\nGenetic defects on the X chromosome affect males because they have only one X chromosome. In females, a recessive gene is usually masked by a normal gene on the other X chromosome. The Y chromosome does carry some genes, but far fewer than the X chromosome. Defects of this type are called \" sex-linked \" in genetics. There is no cure for this disease but there are different treatments available around the world. \n\nA person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac. \n\nNicholas II of Russia \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-01-05T06:15:19Z", "text_length": 2213}

When a person has leukemia, the body creates too many white blood cells (leukocytes). \n\nThere are many kinds of leukemia. Leukemia is part of a bigger group of diseases, the blood cancers (hematological neoplasms). Without treatment, leukemia may lead to death within weeks, months, or years. The life of the person depends upon the type of leukemia. \n\nIn 2000, about 256,000 children and adults around the world developed some form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. About 90% of all leukemias are seen in adults. \n\nLeukemia can be either acute or chronic. Acute leukemia usually grows quickly. Chronic leukemia grows slowly. \n\nLeukemia can also affect two different types of white blood cells. These are lymphoid cells and young granulocyte cells (which are called myelocytes). \n\nFor this reason, all of the different forms of leukemia are divided into four main types: \n\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia. It is common in young children but can also be seen in old people. \n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is usually seen in people over the age of 55. Children almost never have this. \n\nAcute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is seen more commonly in adults than in children. \n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) happens mostly in adults. \n\nThe causes of most types of leukemia are not known. In general, all cancers have a breakdown in the normal way cell division is controlled. Most likely, the different kinds of leukemias have different causes. The known causes account for relatively few cases. Most of the causes are outside our control. \n\nResearchers believe that some things may influence whether a person develops leukemia: \n\nExposure to Ionizing radiation \n\nExposure to certain chemicals, for example benzene. \n\nCertain viruses \n\nTreatment with certain drugs that influence how cells develop; e.g. treatment of a tumor; Chemotherapy \n\nCertain genetic factors. \n\nViruses that are believed to cause leukemia include: \n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus or HIV \n\nHuman T-lymphotropic virus \n\nFanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing acute myelogenous leukemia. \n\nMost cases of leukemia are treated with many drugs, which are usually combined into a chemotherapy program.

Rape is one form of sexual assault, but there are others. \n\nDifferent countries have different definitions of sexual assault. It is illegal, but often not reported. People convicted of sexual assault are sometimes sent to prison. In some places the crime of sexual assault has replaced the crime of rape. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, rape is a separate crime to sexual assault. \n\nAs many as 90-99% of people with developmental disabilities are sexually exploited before they are 18 years old. \n\nA 2010-2011 study in the United States of 1058 people aged 14 to 21 found that 8% had sexually assaulted in their lives.

{"title": "Huntington's disease", "parsed_text": "Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder. It affects the brain and gets worse over time. This can lead to problems with moving, memory loss as well as thinking skills. Lastly, it also causes changes in behavior. Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease. On average, the disease leads to death about fifteen years after the first signs of the illness show. It is found in about 6 in 100,000 people. There is a 50% chance of inheriting this disease from the parents. \n\nThe disease is named after George Huntington. George Huntington specialized in medicine and psychology. In 1872, he was the first to describe the medical condition he was seeing in patients in a paper about science. In an 1908 review, an important scientist who also focused on medicine and psychology, William Osler said about this paper: \" In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described. \" \n\nAccording to Huntington, the disease is characterized by three things: it is inherited; people who have it become cases for psychiatry (insanity and people who kill themselves); and it only occurs in adults. That was the medical understanding at that time. Of these, the last one is wrong: some children also show signs of the disease. \n\nSymptoms of Huntington's disease usually begin between the ages of 35 and 44 years. They can, however, start in any age group from babies to old age. Also, Huntington's disease kills the cells in the body and brain. \n\nIn fact, children with Huntington's disease are often much sicker. They get worse faster. Instead of having chorea, they usually have rigidity (or stiffness) of their muscles and it is painful. Seizures (uncontrollable movements in the body) are also a common sign in children. \n\nIn 2015, there is still no treatment for the disease itself. There are medicines available to help with some of the symptoms. Tetrabenazine was approved in 2008 by the FDA. This medicine helps slow some of the restless movements of chorea. Other medicines that can help with psychiatric symptoms and movements are benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants usually taken for seizures. \n\nScience Daily reported on May 6, 2019 that an international clinical trial has found a new drug is safe. It reported that the drug used by UBC researchers successfully lowers levels of Huntingtin protein. \n\nWoody_Guthrie#Illness_from_Huntington's_disease \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-30T00:59:48Z", "text_length": 2921}
{"title": "Birth defect", "parsed_text": "Birth defects (or congenital defects) are defects in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life. \n\nThere are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities, which are hereditary. The second is caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases) which a baby gets from its mother. \n\nSometimes doctors can find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth. They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis. \n\nSome gene alleles (versions of a gene) can damage the baby. \n\nConditions like dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin. One type, achondroplasia, happens when a child's bones does not grow correctly. Another type is caused by pituitary malfunction, where the pituitary gland, which puts out growth hormones, does not work properly. \n\nMany genetic disorders are caused by mutations (or changes) in gene alleles. Mutations can cause development to go wrong, or a simple biochemical deficiency (the body does not have enough of an important chemical). In the case of a chemical deficiency, the problem may be curable. For example, phenylketonuria was a cause of mental retardation. Doctors came up with a simple test to find which babies have this condition. They found that if these children got treated and followed a strict diet, they could get enough of the chemical they needed. Phenylketonuria now causes few cases of mental retardation. \n\nAnother type of genetic defect is caused by errors in chromosome copying during the cell division which produces the gametes (meiosis). Cells divide and copy themselves to produce gametes. Sometimes, errors happen in the way that chromosomes are copied during this process. These errors are then copied again and again as cells keep dividing and copying themselves. The most common chromosomal disorder is Down syndrome ('Mongolism'). This condition happens when a child has three copies of the 21st chromosome, instead of two. \n\nThe other main type of congenital disorder is caused by an infectious disease being passed from mother to child. For example, If a pregnant woman gets rubella, her child can have many birth defects. Congenital syphilis was common a century ago, and congenital AIDS occurs today, and is common in some parts of Africa. \n\nAs time passes, screening and antibiotics has caused the number of infections transmitted by the mother to drop. It is a much smaller proportion than a century ago, despite AIDS. Also, maternal nutritional defects are much rarer, except in countries where food supply is limited. Therefore, genetic disorders have grown as a proportion of the total congenital defects. \n\nSometimes mothers take chemicals which cause the embryo damage. Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen. \n\nDrugs taken by the mother may affect development of the embryo. Pregnant women are not allowed to use some drugs. For example, thalidomide should not be used by a pregnant woman, or it can cause many defects in the foetus. \n\nIf the mother took certain things during pregnancy, these can lead to problems with the baby. Common examples of such things are smoking tobacco, or drinking alcohol. Food related: Pregnant women should eat well. If a pregnant woman does not receive enough folic acid with her food, the child can get neural tube defects. \n\nMany women give up cigarettes and alcohol when pregnant, because this gives the embryo a better chance of developing normally. \n\nAbout 3 percent of all babies have what is called a major physical anomaly. This is something that damages the way the baby looks, or how it functions (its physiology). \n\nBirth defects involving the brain are the most common problems. They concern about 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart problems, at 8 per 1000, kidney problems at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000. All other physical anomalies together occur in 6 per 1000 live births. \n\nBirth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood. They are the cause of 28% of infant deaths due to birth defects. chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for 15%, and brain malformations about 12%. About 10% of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease. This is more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases. \n\nChina Birth Deformity Monitoring Centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every 30 seconds in China. \n\nPregnancies which do not come to term (miscarriages) have similar causes to birth defects. Many will be due to failures in the genetics controlling development of the embryo. \n\nMost clinically apparent miscarriages (two thirds to three-quarters in various studies) occur during the first trimester. Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. \n\nA pregnancy with a genetic problem has a 95% probability of ending in miscarriage. Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher miscarriage rates observed in older women. \n\nList of genetic disorders \n\nComplete Genomics \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-23T11:50:53Z", "text_length": 6151}

{"title": "Stroke", "parsed_text": "A stroke is an illness in which part of the brain loses its blood supply. This can happen if an artery that feeds blood to the brain gets clogged, or if it tears and leaks. \n\nA stroke is when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain. There are two types of strokes. One is when there is a blood clot blocking the artery. The other type of stroke is when a blood vessel bursts and there is blood moving around freely in the brain. \n\nA stroke is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can happen because of ischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial embolism), or a haemorrhage (leakage of blood). \n\nAs a result, the affected area of the brain cannot work properly. Symptoms might include: hemiplegia (an inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body), aphasia (inability to understand or use language), or an inability to see one side of the visual field. \n\nA stroke is a medical emergency. It can cause permanent damage. If it is not quickly treated, it may lead to death. It is the third most common cause of death and the most common cause of disability for adults in the United States and Europe. \n\nStrokes happen on both the left and right side of the brain. When a stroke happens on the left side of someone\u2019s brain, it affects the right side of the body. It can also cause problems with the patient\u2019s speech and language. If a stroke affects the right side of the brain, it affects the left side of the body. It also changes patient\u2019s spatial (relating to space) perceptions. Getting a stroke on the right side of the brain can also cause people to not acknowledge their illness. Patients behave impulsively and neglect the side of their body. \n\nFactors that increase the risk of a stroke include old age, high blood pressure, a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, atrial fibrillation, migraine with aura, and thrombophilia (a tendency to thrombosis). Of those factors, the most easy to fix are high blood pressure and smoking. \n\nThe Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale was designed to help \" pre-hospital \" medical professionals (like EMTs) identify a possible stroke before the patient gets to the hospital. It tests three basic signs. If any of these signs are not normal, the patient may be having a stroke and should be transported to a hospital as soon as possible. \n\n#Facial droop: Have the person smile or show his or her teeth. \n\n#Normal: Both sides of face move equally \n\n#Abnormal: One side of face does not move as well as the other (or at all); part of the face looks like it is drooping \n\n#Arm drift: Have the person close his or her eyes and hold his or her arms straight out for about 10 seconds. \n\n#Normal: Both arms move equally or not at all \n\n#Abnormal: One arm does not move, or one arm drifts down compared with the other side \n\n#Speech: Have the person say, \" You can't teach an old dog new tricks, \" or some other simple, familiar saying. \n\n#Normal: Patient uses correct words with no slurring \n\n#Abnormal: Patient's speech is slurred, patient uses incorrect words, or is unable to speak \n\nAbout 72% of patients who cannot do one of these three tasks normally are having an ischemic stroke. More than 85% of patients who cannot do all three tasks are having an acute stroke. \n\nThe 'spot a stroke' campaign, created by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, teaches everyday people how to recognize a stroke. It teaches the basic tests from the Cincinnati Stroke Scale, using the acronym FAST: \n\nF: Face - Facial Droop. Is one side of the face drooping or numb? Ask the person to smile. Is the person's smile uneven? \n\nA: Arm - Arm Weakness. Is one arm weak or numb? Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? \n\nS: Speech - Speech Difficulty. Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand? Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence, like \" The sky is blue. \" Is the sentence repeated correctly? \n\nT: Time - Time to Call 911. If someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms go away, it is time to call 9-1-1. \n\nOnce the patient is in the hospital, doctors can find out for sure whether they are having a stroke by looking at their brain with special scanning machines, like an MRI or a CT scanner. \n\nStrokes can kill.

{"title": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorder", "parsed_text": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders happen when the circadian rhythm is not working correctly. They make people sleep and wake at times that are not normal, but these people usually have 8 hours of good sleep. These disorders affect other systems in the body, too, and not just sleep. Circadian rhythms also control appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles. \n\n\" Extrinsic \" means something which comes from outside rather than from within a system or an organism. There are two circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the extrinsic type: \n\nJet Lag \n\nJet Lag often affects people who have travelled several hours east or west, through several time zones. It may take many days for the body to adjust. The name \" jet lag \" comes from travelling by jet aircraft. \n\nShift work syndrome \n\nMany people have health problems when they work a shift during the times when their circadian rhythms say that they should be asleep. Most people who work later than midnight find it difficult to stay awake. \n\n\" Intrinsic \" means something which happens or comes from within a system or an organism. There are four circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the intrinsic type. Unless they are caused by a head injury, they are usually genetic, that is, people are born with them. They are generally chronic; they do not go away, but they may sometimes be treated. \n\nAdvanced sleep-phase syndrome \n\nAdvanced sleep-phase syndrome (ASPS) is very rare. People with this syndrome are sleepy very early in the evening and they sleep from about 19:00-20:00 in the evening to about 03:00-04:00 in the early morning. Often several people in the same family have ASPS. \n\nDelayed sleep-phase syndrome \n\nDelayed sleep-phase syndrome (DSPS) is more common than ASPS and it affects about 0.15% of adults. It usually starts in early childhood or at puberty. Some cases that start at puberty go away when the person is about 20 or 21 years old. DSPS is much more common in teenagers than in adults. DSPS in people older than about 20 usually will have it all their lives, that is, it is chronic. \n\nPeople with DSPS cannot go to sleep before 03:00-06:00 in the morning, or even later. They cannot wake up in time for school or a job which starts in the morning. They can go to sleep at the same time every night and get up at the same time each day. This means that they are entrained (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle. Even when they try to sleep at \" normal \" times, they feel most awake late at night. \n\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome \n\nNon-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome (Non-24) is quite rare. People with Non-24 have very unusual sleep timing. Their sleep and wake times are not regulated by daylight; they are not entrained (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle. This is called freerunning sleep. \n\nThe worst circadian rhythm sleep disorder in people who can see is Non-24; their \" daily \" rhythm lasts 25 hours or more so they sleep and wake up one or more hours later each day. Appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles all keep moving around the clock, coming back to the same time after a few weeks. \n\nAbout half of totally blind people, who can see no light at all, have Non-24. Their daily rhythm is not exactly 24 hours and it does not adjust to the light/dark cycle in nature because they can not see light. This can often be treated. \n\nIrregular sleep-wake disorder \n\nIrregular sleep-wake disorder is rare, and it is often possible to find out what causes it, for example, a head injury, a mental handicap, dementia or some other sicknesses. People with this disorder sleep and wake several times a day, but not at the same times every day. They sleep about 8 hours a day but never 8 hours together. \n\nTreatment for these disorders often does not work well. In addition, it can be difficult to find a doctor who knows much about circadian rhythms, as the field of study is quite new. \n\nBright light \n\nTreatment with bright light is also called phototherapy or light therapy. People with ASPS need a lot of light in the evening and they should avoid bright light in the morning. People with DSPS need bright light as soon as they wake up and should try to avoid bright light before bedtime. \n\nMelatonin \n\nMelatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain. It is normally only produced in the evening and at night. People with ASPS can take melatonin by mouth in the morning. People with DSPS can take melatonin in the afternoon or evening, and this treatment works also for some people with Non-24. \n\nOne can buy melatonin in the shops in the USA and Canada.

{"title": "Bruise", "parsed_text": "A bruise, also called a contusion or an ecchymosis, is a visible bluish or purplish mark or patch appearing beneath the surface of the skin, resulting from blood that leaked out of the deeper layers of the tissues. Bruises are usually caused by a blow or pressure. In older people, bruises may also occur without a special reason. \n\nBruises often cause pain but are normally not dangerous. Sometimes bruises can be serious and lead to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, or they can be associated with serious injuries such as fractures and internal bleeding. Minor bruises may be easily recognized, in people with light skin color, by their characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as \" black and blue \" ) in the days following the injury. \n\nBruises change color over time. That is because the body is fixing the bruise by breaking down and reabsorbing the blood, which makes the bruise to go through many colors before it later disappears. The age of a bruise can be guessed by looking at its color. \n\nAt the start, it is red because of the blood that is appearing just under the skin. \n\nWithin the first five days the hemoglobin inside the blood changes and the bruise turns into the color of a bluish-purple or even black. \n\nBetween five and ten days, the bruise usually becomes slightly green or yellow. \n\nThen, after 10 or 14 days, it finally becomes a yellowish-brown or light brown. \n\nUsually, a bruise takes about two weeks to fade away. Some people bruise easily, but others do not. This is because they may have more tough skin tissue, certain diseases or conditions, or they take certain kinds of medication. \n\nAlso, blood vessels tend to become fragile as people get older, which is why elderly people receive a bruise much more easily. \n\nApplying cold when the bruise is discovered helps make it smaller, because it stops the blood that's flowing to the area. It also keeps the swelling down. It is best to apply ice to the bruise for half an hour to an hour at a time for a day or two after the bruise first appears. However, it is not advisable to place ice right on the skin. Putting some icecubes in a plastic bag and wrapping a towel around the bag is a better idea to stop the bruise from getting worse. \n\nAnother way to help heal the bruise is to put the bruised area above the level of the heart. This helps to slow the flow of the blood because more of the blood in the bruise will flow back toward the rest of the body instead of leaking out into the tissues. If this is not done, more blood will flow into the bruise and make it grow. \n\nIf the bruise causes pain, painkillers, such as NSAIDs may be used against the pain. Certain creams exist to help with bruises. These creams usually combine a substance that helps skin growth with one that acts against the pain. Gently massaging the area of the bruise may also help recovery, and stop the pain, according to the gate theory of pain. If the massage is painful, it will not help the healing process. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days after the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped. Increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, but if the injury is still bleeding this will also allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse. In most cases, hematomas spontaneously revert. In cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs ( <nowiki> e.g. </nowiki> , the brain), a physician may perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow the blood to exit. \n\nBruises that do not result from the application of force (blunt trauma) may be a symptom for other conditions: People with such bruises often have a problem with their blood. Platelet or coagulation disorders often lead to the increased bruising. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. \n\nDuring an autopsy, bruises accompanying abrasions indicate the abrasions occurred while the person was alive, as opposed to damage that occurred after death \n\nHow to get rid of bruises - Home Remedies \n\nFirstaidweb on bruises \n\nWhat is a bruise? for kids \n\n& topcategory=Sports Bruises in sports \n\nFake bruises as fashion", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T00:16:56Z", "text_length": 4800}
{"title": "Body dysmorphic disorder", "parsed_text": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental illness where people think they look different to how they really look. People are usually said to have BDD if they are extremely critical of their body, even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it. If there is something wrong with their body, it is usually so small that a person without BDD would not be unhappy about it at all. People claim that they are insecure, but BDD is far worse. \n\nMost people without BDD may not like some parts of their body, but people with BDD believe that they are so ugly, even though they are not, that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people, or live normally, scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look. People with BDD often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain, or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly. \n\nBDD is a somatoform disorder. People with BDD may look at themselves in the mirror too much, or some people with BDD may actually try not to look in the mirror. Both of these are possible for a person with BDD. They usually think about their body for more than one hour per day, and in bad cases, can stop talking to other people, and may stay at home. People with BDD often have very low self-confidence, because they believe that a person's value is linked to what they look like, and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves, they do not think they have much value. \n\nIn 1886, BDD was first written about by the researcher 'Morselli', who named it Dysmorphophobia. \n\nIn 1987, BDD was first properly seen by the American Psychiatric Association. \n\nIn 1997, BDD was first recorded and formally seen as a mental problem in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). \n\nSigmund Freud had an important Russian person (Sergei Pankejeff) with him in the past, who would have been classified as having the disorder in modern times. Freud named him \" The Wolf Man \" , to protect Pankejeff's identity. Pankejeff was so unhappy with his nose that he could not live a normal life. \n\nIt is unknown what the full cause of BDD is. However, research shows that a number of things may be the cause: \n\nThe chemicals in the brain. If the amount of serotonin is too low, one of the brain's neurotransmitters which gives us 'mood' and 'pain', may help cause body dysmorphic disorder. Scientists can not explain this chemical problem in the brain, but it may be hereditary (passed down from parents to child). \n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder. Many people with BDD also have OCD, where the person does things without wanting to. If people have had, or have a genetic link to OCD, the person may be more likely to have BDD. \n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder. Many people with BDD also have generalized anxiety disorder. This disorder is where the person worries about things a lot, which makes them have anxiety about things in their life, for example, about their body, as in BDD. \n\nBDD usually develops in adolescence, a time when people usually worry about their appearance the most. However, many people with BDD suffer for years before they look for help. When they do look for help to Doctors, people with the problem often say they have other problems, for example, depression, social anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, but do not say their real problem is with the way they look. Most patients can not be convinced that the problem they have with their body is only 'imagined', and that they are seeing a 'changed' view of themselves, because people do not know much about BDD, compared to other mental problems, for example OCD or others. \n\nThe DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) IV says that a person must have the things written below if they have BDD: \n\nBeing unhappy with an imagined problem on their body. If a small problem is there, the person is unhappy with it more than they should be. \n\nThe unhappiness causes large problems in talking to other people, having a job, or living a normal life. \n\nThe unhappiness is not caused by a different mental problem (for example, unhappiness with weight in Anorexia Nervosa). \n\nA person with BDD will often do these things: \n\nLook in the mirror a lot, look in reflective doors, windows and other reflective surfaces. \n\nIf the person does not look in the mirror a lot, they will try not to look in the mirror or at photographs ever, and will often not have mirrors in their home. \n\nTouch their skin a lot to feel the 'imagined' problem. \n\nWanting other people to say good things to them about the way they look a lot. \n\nAsking other people about the way they look a lot. \n\nNot talk to people a lot. \n\nNot having much confidence \n\nComparing the way they look to people they want to look like a lot. This may be of celebrities, or people in their life. \n\nDoing exercise or having diets more than normal. \n\nDoing these things a lot: combing hair, plucking eyebrows, shaving, etc. \n\nUsing medicine to change the body shape and body size. \n\nWanting plastic surgery or more than one plastic surgery, more than normal. \n\nIn some extreme examples, patients have tried to do plastic surgery to themself. \n\nDr. Katharine Philips did research, with more than 500 people with BDD, on the percentage of patients unhappy with the most common parts of the body; \n\nskin (73%) \n\nhair (56%) \n\nnose (37%) \n\nweight (22%) \n\nstomach (22%) \n\nbreasts/chest/nipples (21%) \n\neyes (20%) \n\nthighs (20%) \n\nteeth (20%) \n\nlegs (overall) (18%) \n\nbody shape / bone shape (16%) \n\nall of face (14%) \n\nlips (12%) \n\nbuttocks (12%) \n\nchin (11%) \n\nfingers (11%) \n\neyebrows (11%) \n\nsource: The Broken Mirror, Katharine A Philips, Oxford University Press, 2005 ed, p56 \n\nHowever, people with BDD often are unhappy about more than one part of their body. \n\nA German study has shown that 1-2% of the population has complete BDD, but a bigger percentage of people show some of the effects (Psychological Medicine, vol 36, p 877). \n\nThe number of men and women with BDD is around the same, but there are slightly more women with it. However, the number of men and women who go to the doctor with it are the same. \n\nStudies show that BDD is common non-clinical places and clinical places. Research was done on 200 people with DSM-IV BDD. These people were aged 12 and older. They were interviewed. The people with BDD were found from 'mental-health doctors', advertisements, their friends and family, and non-psychiatrist physicians. 53 of the 200 people were receiving medication, 33 were receiving psychotherapy, and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy. How bad each person's BDD was, was assessed using the \" Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale \" , modified for BDD. Symptoms were assessed with the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination. Both tests were made just for BDD. The results showed that BDD is in 0.7% - 1.1% of community samples and 2%-13% of non-clinical samples. 13% of psychiatric patients had BDD. Research also found that some of the patients who were firstly diagnosed with OCD, also had BDD. 53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared to each other in research. Clinical features, comorbidity, family history, and population features were compared between the two groups. 9 of the 62 subjects (14.5%) of those with OCD also had BDD. \n\nIn most examples, BDD is not found even when people have it. In research done on 17 patients with BDD, BDD was 'found' in only five patients, and none of the patients had a proper diagnosis of BDD even though they all in fact had BDD. \n\nBDD can cause only a few problems for some people. However, for other people, it can cause many problems. \n\nIt can make it very difficult to have a normal job or family life. People who have a job or a family to care for would definitely find life easier and better if they did not have BDD. The love partners of BDD people can also suffer, as they may sometimes lose their loved one to suicide. Friendship, romance, and family is very hard to hold for a person with BDD, as the unhappiness with the looks of the person takes over their life, so they often do not bother with the other aspects of life as much. Also, the BDD stops the person from making these 'bonds' with people, as they always feel scared about the way they look, and therefore find it difficult to be themself with other people. \n\nPeople with BDD may often have little motivation for anything. This means that BDD people can appear to take a long time to get everything done. However, this is not exactly true, because BDD sufferers will often just stop what they were doing for a long time, so it is not just that they are slow, but find it difficult to concentrate on what they are doing. without being able to actually motivate themselves until it becomes completely necessary to get back up. This low amount of motivation can be in all parts of a person's life, for example, school, friends, love, family, or work. \n\nHowever, when the person is trying to do things to the way they look, such as combing their hair, or choosing clothes, it is common for the person to have an extreme motivation. Therefore, people with BDD can sometimes not feel motivated for anything in their life, but when they are working on their looks, they will have an extreme motivation that is not normal either. \n\nPeople with BDD have a very high suicide rate compared to all mental problems. \n\nPhillips & Menard did a lot of research in 2006 about BDD suicides. \n\nThey found that the percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is 45 times higher than the percentage of all the USA population who commit suicide. \n\nThe percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is more than 2 times higher than the percentage of people in the USA with depression who commit suicide. \n\nThe percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is 3 times higher than the percentage of people in the USA with bipolar disorder who commit suicide. \n\nSome people say that there is a link between undiagnosed BDD and a higher than average suicide rate with people who had cosmetic surgery. \n\nAnother condition, Gender identity disorder (GID), where the person finds his or her gender as a male or female uncomfortable, often has BDD-like feelings that are only directed at the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics on their body, which disagree with the person's perception of their own gender since birth. People with GID may also have BDD-like traits or their condition may be mis-diagnosed as BDD. Most studies reported a pre- transition GID suicide attempt rate of 20% or more. The suicide attempt rate for patients with BDD is 15%. No studies are available showing overlap between GID and BDD suicide rate because BDD is excluded as a condition prior to GID diagnosis. \n\nBDD and GID are different conditions. One of the key differences is the fact that BDD responds to psychopharmacology, whereas GID does not. Furthermore, psychopharmacology or psychotherapy are often successful in convincing the BDD sufferer that their perceptions are distorted. Those with GID are rarely convinced that they are mistaken. GID (especially \" transsexualism \" ) also often manifests during early childhood, rather than during adolescence. It is standard practice in treating BDD to convince sufferers that surgical procedures are not necessary because eradicating their first perceived defect through surgery will only make them start obsessing about their next perceived defect, whereas those people properly diagnosed as \" transsexual \" under GID benefit greatly from surgical procedures specifically targeted at their primary or secondary sex characteristics. However, a person with GID may also have BDD if they obsess over perceived defects on their body that contradict or go beyond their gender identity. \n\nBDD is often wrongly thought of as a 'vanity' obsession, but it is actually the opposite, because people with BDD believe they are very ugly, even though people without BDD do not think they are. There is not usually actually anything wrong with the way the person with BDD looks, but to that person, there is. A person with BDD can spend hours looking in the mirror, but they are not being vain, as they do not think they are attractive. People with BDD usually realize that worrying about their looks so much is bad, but they can not help it. \n\nALSO a person with BDD may alternatively avoid mirrors at all costs. Or any reflective surfaces for that matter. Including spoons, windows, mirrors, etc. \n\nResearch found that talking as therapy, has not worked to stop BDD. However, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been found to be more effective. In a study of 54 patients with BDD, some of them had Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and some had no treatment. BDD symptoms decreased a lot in those patients undergoing CBT. BDD was eliminated in 82% of cases at post treatment and 77% at follow-up. (8) Due to low levels of serotonin in the brain, another commonly used treatment is SSRI drugs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). 74 subjects were enrolled in a placebo controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of fluoxetine hydrochloride, a SSRI drug. Patients were randomized to receive 12-weeks of double-blind treatment with fluoxetine or the placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, 53% of patients responded to the fluoxetine. \n\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder is a chronic disease that has symptoms that never subside. Instead, they get worse as time goes on. Without treatment, BDD could last a lifetime. In many cases, as illustrated in The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips, the social lives of many patients disintegrates because they are so preoccupied with their appearance. \n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder \n\nGender identity disorder \n\nBipolar disorder \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-19T04:29:51Z", "text_length": 16154}

Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different.

People with depression or alcoholism may sleep poorly. \n\n(Sleeping sickness, a disease carried by the Tsetse fly, is not classified as a sleep disorder.) \n\nThe most common sleep disorders include: \n\nBruxism: grinding or clenching the teeth while sleeping \n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome/disorder (DSPS): a circadian rhythm sleep disorder (see above): waking up and falling asleep much later than normal, but with no problem staying asleep \n\nHatzfeldt Syndrome, or Systemic Neuro-Epiphysial Disorder (SNED): an irregular sleep pattern, as well as irregular behavior \n\nHypopnea syndrome: abnormally shallow or slow breathing while sleeping \n\nNarcolepsy: falling asleep spontaneously and unwillingly at the wrong times \n\nNight terror disorder: sudden awakening from sleep showing fear or terror \n\nParasomnias, see above \n\nPeriodic limb movement disorder (PLMD): Sudden uncontrolled movement of arms and/or legs during sleep, for example kicking the legs. (Can seem like hypnic jerk, but hypnic jerk is not a disorder.) \n\nPrimary insomnia, inability to get to sleep or stay asleep, not caused by any other disorder \n\nRapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD): acting out violent or dramatic dreams while in \" rapid eye movement \" (REM) sleep, also called dream sleep \n\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS): urge or need to move legs. People with RLS often also have PLMD. \n\nShift work sleep disorder (SWSD) \n\nSleep apnea (obstructive type): often waking suddenly when breathing stops, and usually loud snoring \n\nSleep paralysis: temporary paralysis of the body shortly before or after sleep. Sleep paralysis may be accompanied by hallucinations of sight, hearing or touch. It is quite common. \n\nSleepwalking: one of the parasomnias, see above \n\nChanges in life style, such as shift work change or travelling over several time zones, can cause sleep disorders. Some other problems that can cause sleeping problems include: \n\nAnxiety \n\nPain \n\nEnvironmental noise \n\nVarious drugs and medications \n\nHormone imbalance \n\nCircadian rhythm disorders \n\nA sleep diary or log can be used to help diagnose (define) the problem. It can also be used to measure improvements. \n\nAccording to Dr. William Dement of the Stanford Sleep Center, anyone who snores and is sleepy in the daytime should see a doctor about sleep disorders. \n\nIn case of chronic pain, both the pain and the sleep problems should be treated. Pain can lead to sleep problems and vice versa. \n\nThe choice of a treatment for a sleep disorder depends on the patient's diagnosis, his/her medical and psychiatric history, and how she or he prefers to be treated. Medications sometimes work fast. On the other hand, sometimes behavioral treatment of insomnia may give more lasting results.", "timestamp": "2017-08-31T12:08:13Z", "text_length": 4226}
{"title": "Parkinson's disease", "parsed_text": "Parkinson's disease (or PD, sometimes simply \" Parkinson's \" ) is a disease that slowly damages the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spine. When a person gets Parkinson's disease, the cells that make dopamine in a part of the brain die. Dopamine cells send information to other cells which makes us do the actions we do. Because of this, Parkinson's disease mainly affects the body's motor system. \n\nParkinson's disease is a disease that gets worse over time. People normally get Parkinson's disease when they are over 50 years old. It is sometimes very hard for doctors to detect. \n\nDoctors are studying the exact causes of Parkinson's. It is said that Parkinson's develops through a combination of genetic errors and several possible influences, but not much is known. Doctors have discovered some clues about the cause(s) . It is caused by the destruction of specialised ganglions in the brain. The production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, reduces. Parkinson's can also be genetic. But research shows that genetic Parkinson's is not normal, and is uncommon. Parkinson's disease is more frequent among those who work with pesticides or have had a history of head injuries. \n\nResearch suggests that people are slightly less likely to get Parkinson's disease if they smoke cigarettes. \n\nParkinson's disease can cause the brain to not respond. The patient may become paralyzed. The disease can give the patient slow reaction time and poor coordination between the hand and the brain. \n\nIt hurts the patient's movement skills and their speech. It can also affect mood, behavior and thinking. A common symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease is tremors. Tremors cause people's hands, legs, and arms to shake. Some symptoms include skin problems, depression, and difficulty swallowing. \n\nThe symptoms of Parkinson's disease include stiff muscles and trouble with movement. This disease gives patients slow reaction time. It makes it hard for them to do simple things like walking and talking. It also causes depression and other emotional changes. \n\nParkinson's disease cannot be completely cured yet. Still, people have tried to cure it with drugs. One treatment is to put back the lost dopamine. A group of drugs called dopamine receptor agonists acts similarly to dopamine when put in the brain. There are four different drugs included in that group. Many patients take one of those with another drug. That other drug is called L-dopa. Unlike the dopamine, the L-dopa can enter the brain. The dopamine cannot enter the brain. This is why many patients take L-dopa and dopamine together. In the beginning, L-dopa helps a lot. But as the disease develops, the L-dopa doesn't work as well. Two other drugs used are anticholinergics and selegiline. They both help lessen symptoms. Anticholinergics help the patient stop shaking. Selegiline is meant to protect the nerves in the central nervous system. Selegiline is not often used. This is because there is no real proof that it helps. \n\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgery that is used some people who suffer from Parkinson's disease. \n\nNational Parkinson Foundation \n\nAsociacion Parkinson TARAY Aranjuez MADRID ESPA\u00d1A \n\nParkinson's Disease Society of the United Kingdom \n\nBlechman Foundation for Parkinson's Research", "timestamp": "2020-06-22T07:45:24Z", "text_length": 4077}
{"title": "Sepsis", "parsed_text": "Sepsis is a very dangerous disease that occurs when an infection goes wrong. Normally the immune system of the body is able to fight the germs and overcome the infection, but in sepsis something goes wrong. The pathogen was at some point able to get into the blood or tissues. The term sepsis is frequently used to refer to septicemia (blood poisoning). Septicemia is only one type of sepsis. Bacteremia specifically refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream (viremia and fungemia are the terms used for viruses and fungi). A sepis is a medical emergency, as it can put the life in danger, if it is not acted on. \n\nCommon symptoms of sepsis are inflammations all over the body. This is often combined with high fever. Today, people believe, these symptoms are caused by the immune system trying to fight the disease. Because of the strong reactions, organs can be damaged in the process. In a sense, the immune system over-reacts the germs and goes awry, causing damage to the organs. \n\nIn the United States, sepsis is the leading cause of death for ICU patients which do not have heart problems. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows it is the tenth most common cause of death overall. Older people, those with a weak immune system and those with a strong illness suffer from sepis more often. It is also more dangerous to them. It occurs in 1%-2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. It is a major cause of death in intensive care units worldwide, with mortality rates that range from 20% for sepsis to 40% for severe sepsis to over 60% for septic shock. \n\nSevere sepsis and septic shock are more severe forms of sepsis. With severe sepsis, one or more organs fail to work. Septic shock is when sepsis is combined with very low blood pressure. \n\nToday, the bacterial forms of sepsis can be treated with antibiotics. In addition, the fluids (blood) containing the germs have to be replaced. It might also be necessary to functionally replace the organs that failed. It is important to begin to treat the sepsis as quickly as possible, as each hour it is left untreated will raise the chances of death by 5% to 10%. \n\nAbout half the people affected and untreated die from the condition. Rapid access to treatment will increase the chances of survival in most cases. \n\nSociety of Critical Care Medicine Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock (and other guidelines)", "timestamp": "2020-03-08T00:33:44Z", "text_length": 2828}
{"title": "Tularemia", "parsed_text": "Tularemia (also called \" Goblin Fever \" , \" deer-fly fever \" , \" Ohara fever \" and \" Francis disease \" ) is a disease. Usually rodents get it. It is caused by a bacterium, Francisella tularensis. There have been cases where the disease spread to humans. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. \n\nCases of tularemia should be reported to the local health authority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention think F. tularensis could possibly be a bioweapons agent. For this reason, it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA, USSR and Japan at various times. A former Soviet biological weapons scientist, Kenneth Alibek, has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to intentional release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces, but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak. Sjostedt, A (2007) \" Tularemia: History, Epidemiology, Pathogen Physiology, and Clinical Manifestations. \" \n\nAnnals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1105:1\u201329 </ref> In the USA, practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s. It was viewed as an attractive agent because: \n\nit is easy to aerosolize \n\nit is highly infective; 10-50 bacteria are required to infect \n\nit is non-persistent and easy to decontaminate (unlike anthrax) \n\nit is highly incapacitating to infected persons \n\nit has low lethality, which is useful where enemy soldiers are in proximity to non-combatants, e.g. civilians \n\nBy the late 1950s the US biological warfare program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent. The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet. It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent. The rate-of-action was around three days, with a duration-of-action of one to three weeks (treated) and two to three months (untreated) with frequent relapses. UL was streptomycin resistant. The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern, being sensitive to sun light, and losing virulence over time after release. \n\nThe United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT (wet-type) and ZZ (dry-type) in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals. When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT (an incapacitant rather than lethal agent), the Schu S4 strain's symbol was changed again to SR. \n\nNo vaccine is available to the general public. The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs (as rabbits), avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources, and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites. \n\nIn summer 2000, an outbreak of tularemia in Martha's Vineyard resulted in one dead person. It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis. Over the following summers, Martha's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing. The research may prove valuable in preventing bioterrorism. \n\nAn outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000. \n\nIn 2004, three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F. tularensis, after apparently failing to follow safety procedures. \n\nIn 2005, small amounts of F. tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington, DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24, 2005. Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall. To this date, no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result. \n\nIn 2007, a lab of Boston University's Center for Advanced Biomedical Research, where F. tularensis were being kept for research, was evacuated after smoke set off alarms. An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit, and no bacterial contamination was found. \n\nIn July 2007, an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and Le\u00f3n and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-10-24T06:54:46Z", "text_length": 4752}

{"title": "Panic attack", "parsed_text": "Panic attacks are sudden periods of very bad anxiety. Along with feeling very scared, people with panic attacks usually have physical symptoms. These symptoms are not dangerous. However, they can make a person feel terrible for a short time. Having a panic attack is often terrifying and very upsetting. Many people who have a panic attack for the first time call the emergency services because they think they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown. \n\nThough panic attacks make people feel terrible, they are not dangerous. Usually, the worst symptoms are over in ten minutes or less. However, some panic attacks can be as short as one to five minutes. \n\nPanic attacks can happen in people with all kinds of mental illnesses. They can also happen in people who have no mental illness, but have just had something very bad happen to them. \n\nThe new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), DSM-5, describes a panic attack as: \n\n\" An abrupt [sudden] surge of intense [very strong] fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes... [During that] time four or more of the following symptoms occur. The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state. \" \n\nAccording to DSM-5, a person is having a panic attack if they suddenly start feeling very scared and have four or more of these symptoms: \n\nPalpitations (a pounding heart) or fast heart rate \n\nSweating \n\nTrembling or shaking \n\nFeeling unable to breathe \n\nFeeling of choking \n\nChest pain or discomfort \n\nNausea or other gastrointestinal problems \n\nFeeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint \n\nFeeling hot, or feeling chills \n\nParesthesias (numbness or tingling feelings) \n\nDerealization (feelings of not being real) or depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself) \n\nFear of losing control or going crazy \n\nFear of dying \n\nPanic attacks happen when the body's natural fight or flight response gets overprotective. Usually, the fight or flight response kicks in when a person is in danger. It tells the sympathetic nervous system to make many changes in the body. These changes will help the person fight or run away from the danger. For example: \n\nThe person will get scared. This makes them want to get away from the danger they are in. \n\nThe heart will beat stronger and faster. This will get as much blood and oxygen to the body as possible. \n\nChemical messengers like epinephrine (adrenaline) will be sent out through the body, to give the body extra energy to fight or run away. \n\nThe body will stop digestion in the digestive tract. The body does this because it wants to spend all its energy on fighting or running away. It does not want to waste energy on things like digestion which will not help the person escape danger. \n\nWhen a person is truly in danger, these changes in the body can help the person survive. The changes in the body make it easier for the person to fight or run away from the danger. \n\nHowever, when a person is having a panic attack, their body is reacting as if they are in danger, when they are really not. Their fight or flight system kicks in and causes changes to the body. But because the person does not need these changes to help them survive, the changes cause symptoms. For example: \n\nThe person will feel very scared, even though they are not actually in danger. \n\nThe person may notice that their heart is pounding (because it is beating stronger) or beating quickly. \n\nThe person may notice side effects from the epinephrine that is being sent out through their body. Those side effects can include sweating, chest pain, and feeling even more anxious. \n\nBecause digestion has suddenly stopped, the person may have nausea, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal problems. \n\nEvery symptom of a panic attack is caused by the fight or flight reaction. This is why panic attacks are not dangerous. The fight or flight system is meant to save a person's life if they are in danger. If is a natural self-defense system in the human body.

{"title": "Gout", "parsed_text": "Gout is a very painful medical condition. It is a red, tender, hot, swollen joint. The attacks happen most often in the joint at the base of the big toe. It is caused by crystals getting deposited from the blood. This happens when the level of uric acid in the blood is too high. The crystals then stay in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues. \n\nInflammatory arthritis happens in about 50% of all cases of gout. The disease may also appear as kidney disease due to urate crystals. People with gout often have more than one attack of gout. \n\nDoctors decide a patient has gout if they find crystals in the joint fluid. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once an attack goes away, the patient can change his or her lifestyle to reduce levels of uric acid. People who have gout attacks often may take allopurinol or probenecid to prevent symptoms later. \n\nGout has become more common. It affects approximately one to two percent of people in the West during their lifetimes. Risk factors have been increasing and may be causing the increase in gout. Metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy, and changes in diet are the most common risk factors. Gout was historically known as \u201cthe disease of kings\u201d or \u201cthe disease of rich men \" . \n\nGout can present in a number of ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of intense inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). Joint pain usually begins over 2\u20134 hours and during the night. Symptoms occur at night because of the lower body temperature at this time. \n\nHigh levels of uric acid in the blood over a long period of time (hyperuricemia) may cause other symptoms such as hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. High levels of uric acid in the blood may also cause crystals to form in the kidneys. This causes stone formation followed by urate nephropathy. \n\nA very high, abnormal level of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) is the basic cause of gout. Diet and a person's genes are two of several possible causes of the high levels. Levels can also become high if the body cannot excrete enough urate, the salts of uric acid. \n\nThe kinds and amounts of foods people eat cause about 12% of gout. Drinking alcohol or fructose-sweetened drinks, and eating meat and seafood can cause this disease. Injuries and surgery may also start an attack of gout. Recent studies showed that some beliefs about connections between diet and gout were not true. Eating purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) large amounts of protein do not contribute to developing gout. Coffee, vitamin C, and dairy products, as well as physical fitness appear to decrease the risk. These things reduce insulin resistance and may reduce cases of gout. \n\nInherited factors are about 60% responsible for the variability in uric acid level. Two genes called SLC2A9 and ABCG2 are commonly associated with gout. Variations in these genes can almost double the risk of developing this disease. \n\nGout often happens with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome happens along with nearly 75% of all cases of gout. Gout often makes these other problems worse or harder to treat: polycythemia, lead poisoning, renal failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, and solid organ transplants. Males have three times the chance of getting gout when the body mass index is greater than or equal to 35. Frequent lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout because lead harms the kidney function. \n\nGout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate. The blood deposits the crystals in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues. These crystals then trigger a localimmune system inflammatory reaction. Uricase is required to breakdown uric acid. An evolutionary loss of uricase in humans and higher primates has made this condition so common. \n\nThe triggers that cause uric acid to build up in the blood are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as uric acid levels increase. Other factors believed to be important in triggering an acute episode of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration, and extracellular matrixproteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens, and chondroitin sulfate. The increased critilization at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to a number of factors, including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics, and stopping or starting the medication allopurinol. \n\nGout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic podagra. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, synovial fluid analysis should be done. X-rays are useful for identifying chronic gout only. X-rays are not useful for treating acute gout attacks. \n\nA definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joint fluid or a tophus. All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed, inflamed joints should be examined for these crystals. Under polarized light microscopy, the crystals have a needle-like shape and strong negative birefringence. This test is difficult to perform, and often requires a trained technician. The fluid must also be examined relatively quickly after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect their solubility. \n\nHyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout. Gout occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. The usefulness of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 \u03bcmol/L (7.0 mg/dL) in males and 360 \u03bcmol/L (6.0 mg/dL) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, renal function, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR). Both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0\u00d710 <sup> 9 </sup> /L (40,000/mm <sup> 3 </sup> ) has been documented in people with gout. \n\nThe most important diagnosis to rule out in gout is septic arthritis (an infection in the joint). This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. A joint fluid Gram stainand culture may be performed to support the diagnosis. Other conditions which present similarly include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis. Gouty tophi, especially when not in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma, or other cancers. \n\nBoth lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of food such as meat and seafood, eating adequate vitamin C, limiting alcohol and fructose consumption, and avoiding obesity. A low-calorie diet in obese men decreased uric acid levels by 100 \u00b5mol/L (1.7 mg/dL) on average. Vitamin C intake of 1,500 mg per day decreases the risk of gout by 45%. Coffee, but not tea, consumption is associated with a lower risk of gout. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea through the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of sleep apnea can lessen the occurrence of gout attacks. \n\nThe first goal of treating gout is to reduce the symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by using different drugs that reduce the uric acid levels in the blood. Ice applied for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day decreases pain. Options for immediate treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of comorbidities is also important. \n\nNSAIDs are the most common treatment for gout. No specific type of NSAID is significantly more or less effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within 4 hours. Treatment is recommended for 1\u20132 weeks. NSAIDs are not recommended for people with certain other health problems such as bleeding from the stomach, esophagus or intestines, renal failure, or heart failure. While indomethacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, ibuprofen may be preferred due to its lack of side effects. A proton pump inhibitor may be given to people at risk of experiencing gastric side effects. \n\nColchicine is an alternative treatment for people that are unable to tolerate NSAIDs. Its side effects, primarily gastrointestinal upset limit its use. The occurrence of gastrointestinal upset depends on the dose. The risk of experiencing this side effect can be reduced by using smaller, yet still effective doses. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs such as atorvastatin and erythromycin. \n\nGlucocorticoids (otherwise known as steroids) have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs for treating gout. Glucocorticoids may be used if it is not possible to use NSAIDs. Using glucocorticoids also lead to improvement when it is injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded if the condition worsens. \n\nPegloticase (Krystexxa) was approved in the USA to treat gout in 2010. It will be a treatment option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks and has been found to reduce uric acid levels in this population. \n\nA number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including xanthine oxidase inhibitor (including allopurinol and febuxostat), and uricosurics (including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone). They are not usually given until one to two weeks after an acute attack has resolved due to concerns that it may worsen attack symptoms. These medications are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first 3\u20136 months. This treatment is not recommended until a person has suffered two gout attacks, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. This type of treatment is delayed until this point because is not cost effective to offer this treatment sooner. Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300\u2013360 \u00b5mol/L (5.0-6.0 mg/dL). This treatment should be continued forever. These medications should be continued even if the person experiences a gout attack while on the medication. \n\nUricosuric drugs are preferred for treating gout if there is not enough uric acid in the urine defined by a 24-hour collection of urine with less than 800 mg of uric acid. Uricosuric drugs are not recommended if the person has a history of renal stones. A 24-hour urine excretion of more than 800 mg indicates overproduction and xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the preferred drugs for providing treatment. Note that probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol. \n\nXanthine oxidase inhibitors (including allopurinol and febuxostat) block uric acid production. Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with reduced renal function or urate stones. Allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals. In such cases, the alternative drug febuxostat has been recommended. \n\nWithout treatment, an acute attack of gout will usually resolve in 5 to 7 days. 60% of people will have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and renal and cardiovascular disease and at increased risk of death. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be simply due to having gout. \n\nWithout treatment, acute gout attacks may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the outer part of the ear, over the outer part of the elbow, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people. Kidney stones occur due to low urine pH promoting the crystallization of uric acid. Other forms of chronic renal dysfunction may occur. \n\n<gallery> \n\nFile:Case 30-top.jpg|Nodules of the finger and helix of the ear representing gouty tophi \n\nImage:ChronicGout.jpg|Tophus of the knee \n\nImage:Case 30-bottom.jpg|Tophus of the toe, and over the external malleolus \n\nImage:Tophigout.JPG|Gout complicated by ruptured tophi (exudate tested positive for uric acid crystals) \n\n</gallery> \n\nGout affects around 1\u20132% of the Western population at some point in their lives and it is becoming more common. Rates of gout have approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet, and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. A number of factors have been found to influence rates of gout, including age, race, and the season of the year. In men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50, prevalence is 2%. \n\nIn the United States, gout is twice as likely to occur in African American males as it is in European Americans. Rates are high among the peoples of the Pacific Islands and the M\u0101ori of New Zealand, but rare in Australian aborigines, despite a higher average concentration of serum uric acid in the aboriginal group. Gout has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies have found that gout attacks occur more frequently in the spring. This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature. \n\nThe word gout was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 a.d. It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning \" a drop \" (of liquid). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and \" the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints \" . \n\nPeople have been aware of gout since ancient times. Historically, it has been referred to as \" the king of diseases and the disease of kings \" or \" the disease of rich men \" . The first documentation of the disease is from Egypt in 2,600 b.c. in a description of arthritis of the largest toe. The Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 b.c. commented on it in his Aphorisms and noted its absence in eunuchs (men who have had there testicles removed at a young age) and women before menopause. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 a.d.) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women, and associated kidney problems: \n\n<blockquote> Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery. </blockquote> \n\nIn 1683, Thomas Sydenham, an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning, and its more frequent occurrence in older males: \n\n<blockquote> Gouty patients are, generally, either old men, or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age - of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery, and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on. </blockquote> \n\nThe Dutch scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod realized that this excess uric acid in the blood was the cause of gout. \n\nGout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid. Humans and other great apes don't have this ability, which makes gout common. The Tyrannosaurus rex specimen known as \" Sue \" , however, is believed to have suffered from gout. \n\nA number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept. A man made uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is also available. Its use is limited because it triggers an autoimmune response. Versions of this medication that are less prone to cause allergies are in development. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T16:11:23Z", "text_length": 21527}

{"title": "Stuttering", "parsed_text": "This page is about speech problems, the album can be found at Hands All Over \n\nStuttering or stammering is a problem some people have when they speak. 5-6% of children have a stammer while 1% of adults have a stammer. Men are 4 times more likely to have a stammer than women. Stammers normally start at 2-6 years and run in families. The person knows what they want to say but the flow of their speech is \u2018bumpy\u2019 and may have some of the following features: \n\nRepetitions (of sounds, parts of words or phrases) \n\nBlocks (stops before words) \n\nProlongations (making a sound longer, e.g.hhhhhhhhhham instead of ham) \n\nPauses \n\nRephrasing (saying something else instead) \n\nHesitations (struggling to say words) \n\nFillers (using key phrases such as \u2018you know what I mean\u2019 to hide their difficulties) \n\nTension (the muscles in their face and neck look tight) \n\nFacial or body movements \n\nStammering can be very upsetting and knock a person's confidence. Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the bumpy parts you can hear (overt parts) of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger block of how the person feels (covert parts) invisible below the surface. These people may feel embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt. These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more. Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program. \n\nStammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends. \n\nStuttering therapy \n\nThis therapy is also known as \" speak more fluently \" , \" prolonged speech \" or \" connected speech. \" It trains stutterers to speak fluently (without the \u2018bumpy bits\u2019) by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips, jaw, and tongue. \n\nStutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants. Other methods include soft speech contacts. This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic. To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased. Many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy. Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete. More recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to work well. \n\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to get rid of stuttering but to change it so that stuttering is easier and less stressful. As fear and worry make people stutter by getting rid of these feelings stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was made by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. Stuttering modification therapy has four stages: \t \n\nIn the first stage, called identification, the stutterer and speech and language therapist work out the core behaviours, secondary behaviors, and feelings that make the stuttering. \n\nIn the second stage, called desensitization, the stutterer works to reduce fear and anxiety. This is done by freezing stuttering behaviors, confronting difficult sounds, words and situations, and stuttering on purpose ( \" voluntary stuttering \" ). \n\nIn the third stage, called modification, the stutterer learns \" easy stuttering. \" This is done by \" cancellations \" (stopping in a stammer, waiting a few moments, and saying the word again); \" pull-outs, \" or pulling out of a stammer into \u2018normal\u2019 speech; and \" preparatory sets, \" or looking ahead for words they may stutter on, and using \" easy stuttering \" on those words. \n\nIn the fourth stage, called stabilization, the stutterer prepares practice assignments, makes preparatory sets and pull-outs automatic, and changes how they feel about themselves from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently but who sometimes stutters mildly. \n\nThere were many famous stutterers: \n\nDemosthenes \n\nIsaac Newton \n\nGareth Gates \n\nNotker Balbulus \n\nScatman John \n\nWinston Churchill \n\nKing George VI \n\nBruce Willis \n\nOzzy Osbourne \n\nTiger Woods \n\nMel Tillis \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-09-03T20:28:17Z", "text_length": 4942}

{"title": "Brain damage", "parsed_text": "Brain damage is damage to the brain from either illnesses or injuries. Brain cells are damaged, which often affects one's brain in a way that stops the brain from thinking or reacting the same way as it did before the brain was damaged. \n\nPhysical damage to the brain is called traumatic brain injury (TBI). It has occurred since ancient times, and old medical records exist. \n\nHead injuries and their effects were known in ancient times. \n\nAncient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650\u20131550 BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain to be the center of thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma. \n\nPerhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage. He survived an accident in 1848 when a large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying at least his left frontal lobe. \n\nHe recovered with no apparent sensory, movement, or big cognitive damage. However, his behaviour so altered that friends described him as \" no longer being Gage \" . This suggested that the damaged areas are involved in \" higher functions \" such as personality. Many cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since. \n\nIn the 1970s, awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew. A great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research, such as the discovery of primary and secondary brain injury. The 1990s saw the development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of TBI, with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure. Research since the early 1990s has improved TBI survival.

If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful peritonitis, and sepsis. Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis. Usually the infected appendix is taken out. \n\nThe function of the appendix in apes is the digestion of vegetable matter such as leaves. Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus. Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our immune system does not serve it well. An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body. \n\nThe causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or bacterial infections. If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock. Most serious appendicitis happens to younger children and elder adults. Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females. The most usual treatment is an appendectomy which means removing the appendix. Sometimes, it gets better without surgery. Some people think that eating vegetables will help, but no chances should be taken.

It is the most common form of traumatic brain injury. Related terms include mild brain injury, mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), mild head injury (MHI), and minor head trauma. Patients with severe concussion are occasionally monitored in hospital. The main reason for this is the risk of bleeding in the brain, which can be life-threatening. \n\nCommon symptoms of concussion include: headache, dizziness, fatigue, problems with vision, confusion and loss of consciousness. A person with a mild concussion may have nothing more than a headache or brief confusion. In more severe cases, symptoms tend to last longer, and may include loss of consciousness. Other associated symptoms are: worsening headache, inability to wake, dilation of the eyes, vomiting, nausea, loss of coordination and weakness of extremities. \n\nSymptoms may last less than a week in minor cases, but recovery from more severe concussions can take up to 4 weeks. The most common causes of concussions are accidents; in some cases, wearing a helmet can help prevent major damage. \n\nOne often underreported symptom of concussion is aphasia. \u00a0 Aphasia is the loss of ability to produce or understand speech; it is caused by brain damage. \u00a0 Most of the important areas for speech and language are located in the left hemisphere. As such, patients who have concussions due to injury on the left side of the head could be more at risk for these symptoms. \n\nThe most common kinds of aphasia associated with traumatic brain injury are amnestic aphasia and verbal paraphasia. \u00a0 Amnesic aphasia, also known as anomia, is an issue with word finding where patients struggle to find words for objects that they once knew. \u00a0There is no impairment of comprehension associated with anomia. This can be especially challenging for students trying to return to school and professionals returning to work.\u00a0 The second kind of aphasia associated with concussion is verbal paraphasia, the substitution of one word for another.\u00a0 Typically, the substituted word will have a similar meaning as the word it replaces; e.g. substituting sock with shoe. \u00a0 \n\nAs with most concussion symptoms, aphasia symptoms correlated with concussion typically get progressively better, as evidenced by a study done by Inger Vibeke Thomsen. Of the concussion patients studied that showed aphasia symptoms, only one patient had long term aphasia.\u00a0 The others showed almost full recovery. \n\nThe National Aphasia Association recognizes that concussions can cause aphasia.\u00a0 In serious concussions, aphasia is a documented symptom and can be temporary or permanent. \u00a0 This is correlated to injury of brain regions that are important for language production. However, traumatic brain injuries usually effect multiple areas of the brain, so other symptoms will also be present. The damage causing aphasia will usually be on the left side of the brain. \n\n<br /> \n\n---- \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-12-14T20:41:17Z", "text_length": 4477}

It may be caused by the immune system, genetic, and environmental factors. \n\nVitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system, leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment. \n\nPeople over 20 years old rarely develop this disease.

When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens. \n\nA weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis. \n\nAntibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. Antibiotic kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply. \n\nEsophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by Candida albicans. The disease happens in unhealthy people. Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with chemotherapy. People with AIDS can also get this infection more often. \n\nOne sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing.

{"title": "Overweight", "parsed_text": "Overweight is the condition of a person when they have more fat in their body than what is thought as to be normal for their height. \n\nTo find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index. People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight. Anything above 30 is said to be obese (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed. \n\nBeing overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight. In 2006 Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 Pubmed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick. \n\n51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women. \n\nDoctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called 'dieting'. They may exercise too. \n\nDieting is often ineffective. 41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began. \n\nSome people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass. \n\nAnimals can also be overweight. \n\nOverweight is not just associated with bad health. People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad. Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this. This is called fatphobia. \n\nMore than 1.4 billion adults are overweight in the world. The amount of overweight people is increasing. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-08T21:08:15Z", "text_length": 2195}
{"title": "Migraine", "parsed_text": "A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms. \n\nMost migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have \" auras \" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours. \n\nMigraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later. Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine. \n\nScientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for \" calcitonin gene-related peptide \" . CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain. \n\nThere are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or fluctuates (goes up and down). \n\nThe World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States. \n\nAcephalgic migraine, also called a silent migraine, is a kind of migraine with aura but without the head pain. This type of migraine usually starts sometime during middle-age, which is after a person is 40 years old, and becomes more common as a person gets older. Unlike other migraines, males have acephalgic migraines more often then females do. \n\nBasilar-type migraine is a type of migraine with aura that causes headache usually in the occipital region of the brain with neurological symptoms that is believed to come from the brainstem, occipital cortex, and cerebellum and/or affects both hemispheres of the brain at the same time. Most people who have basilar-type migraine also experience migraines with aura without the basilar symptoms. This type of migraine usually more common in people under age 20 and young females. \n\nFamilial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a type of migraine with aura that also may cause paralysis on one side of the body. When the migraine stops, the person can move normally again. \n\nRetinal migraine has repeated times of vision loss in one eye, that may happen before or during a headache. People who have retinal migraines usually have a history of having one of the other more common types of migraine. \n\nMenstrual migraine or catamenial migraine is a type of migraine that happens perimenstrually, which means around the time of menstruation during a woman's monthly menstrual cycle. Menstrual migraine is usually a migraine without aura, but sometimes a menstrual migraine with aura happens. About 7%-14% of women have migraines exclusively at the time of menstruation. These are considered true menstrual migraines. Most female migraneurs experience migraine attacks at all times during the menstrual cycle, with an increased number perimenstrually. These are referred to as menstrually related or menstrually triggered migraine. Both true menstrual migraines and menstrually related migraines are categorized under menstrual migraine. \n\nThe role of estrogen \n\n::Estrogen is a hormone that is mostly made in a woman's ovaries. There are three types of estrogen: estrone, estradiol and estriol. In women who have migraines it is usually connected with their menstruation cycle. About 60% of women have these menstrual or menstrually-related migraines and the main trigger is believed to be reduced circulating estrogen levels, i.e. the amount of estrogen in the body, specifically estradiol. In some cases, fluctuation (going up and down) in the amount of circulating estrogen levels may trigger a migraine, i.e. not only too little but sometimes too much estrogen may trigger a migraine. \n\nChildhood periodic syndromes are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they become adults. \n\nAbdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the periumbilical area. Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults. \n\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes vertigo. \n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting. CVS happens more often in children, but it can occur at any age. \n\nEpisodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine, those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability. Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke. \n\nAbout 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study) \n\nAura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as scotomas (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking. \n\nScotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: skotos): a blind spot or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either absolute where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, relative with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma. \n\nScotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the fortification scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights. \n\nIn medicine a factor is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a risk factor. A trigger factor or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin. \n\n;Risk factors \n\nGender: Women are three times more likely to have migraine headaches than men. \n\nFamily history: A person has more of a chance of getting migraines if one of their parents has had them. The International Headache Consortium are doctors from a lot of different countries who study headaches and what causes them. They have found four genetic variations - these are differences in a persons genes - that are risk factors for migraine without aura in people who have these differences. Two of these genetic variations had already been shown to play a role in migraine with aura. \n\nHormonal changes \n\nObesity: has shown to be a risk factor for chronic migraine not episodic migraine. \n\n;Triggers \n\nDietary habits: fasting, dehydration, or skipping meals. \n\nDiet: Eating certain foods such as those that contain tyramine which is found in certain foods and is the end result of the natural breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine. Various food contain tyramine such as aged cheeses, smoked fish, some kinds of beer. Tyramine as a trigger for migraine is thought to effect less than 10% of people with migraines. \n\nThere are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms. The diagnosis of migraine is a clinical diagnosis which means it is based upon a person's medical history that a person reports to the doctor. The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the headache history includes information such as: \n\nDoes anyone else in the person's family have medical problems. If so what kind? \n\nWhat are all the symptoms you have? \n\nAt what age did the symptoms first start? \n\nHow often do the headaches and/or other symptoms occur? \n\nHow long do the symptoms last? \n\nWhere is the pain? Unilateral: either left or right side of the head - bilateral: both left and right sides \n\nDifferential diagnoses are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them. \n\nBrain tumor \n\nCluster headache \n\nSinusitis \n\nStroke \n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage \n\nTension headache \n\nVascular pathologies: medical conditions that effect the vascular system such as arteriovenous malformation \n\nOften, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the \" comorbid disorders \" or \" comorbidities \" . There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and prognosis (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders. <br> \n\n:Asthma \n\n:Raynaud\u2019s disease: is a circulatory disorder in which the smaller arteries that supply blood to the extremities - most often the hands, but it may also affect the, toes, the tip of the nose and the ears - become narrower reducing blood flow. This causes the extremities to become numb and to be cooler than the core body temperature. It can be triggered by exposure to stress and cold. \n\n:Epilepsy \n\n:Fibromyalgia \n\nComorbid psychiatric conditions \n\n:Major depressive disorder \n\n:Anxiety \n\n:Bipolar disorder \n\nIn medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines). \n\nChronic migraine \n\nStatus migrainosus is the term used to describe a severe migraine attack which lasts more than 72 hours straight. \n\nPersistent aura without stroke \n\nMigraine stroke \n\nMigraine-triggered seizures \n\nIn medicine epidemiology is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to. \n\nMigraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The number of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older. \n\nBetween 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress. \n\nAbout two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura. \n\nSymptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history. The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E. A treatment for migraine can be found in the Ebers Papyrus, an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them. In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E. migraine is refereed to as \" suffering in half the head \" . \n\nAnother remedy for suffering in half the head. The skull of a catfish fried in oil. Anoint the head herewith.-Ebers Papyrus,1552 B.C.E. \n\nThe Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed heterocrania is considered a description of migraine. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-14T22:47:11Z", "text_length": 16523}
{"title": "Dengue fever", "parsed_text": "Dengue fever (pronounced \" DEN-gi \" ) is a tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking. \n\nMost people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment. \n\nThere is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever. Doctors can only provide \" supportive care, \" which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms. \n\nSince the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever. \n\nMost people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever). About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them. \n\nAfter a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days. \n\nOften, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold. However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever. \n\nDengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery. \n\nIn the febrile stage, people with dengue usually have a high fever. ( \" Febrile \" means that a person has a fever.) The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back. \n\nDuring the febrile stage, people may also have: \n\nPain all over their bodies \n\nA headache \n\nA rash (this happens in 50% to 80% of people who get sick from dengue) \n\nPetechiae (small red spots on the skin). These are caused by capillaries (which carry blood) breaking. This makes the blood leak out and show up under the skin. \n\nSmall amounts of bleeding from the mucous membranes in the mouth and nose \n\nThe febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days. This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone. \n\nIn about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a critical stage next. ( \" Critical \" means \" very dangerous. \" ) The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days. \n\nDuring this stage, plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels. The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen. This is a serious problem for a few reasons. \n\nPlasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body. Every part of the body needs these things to survive. If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs. Without these things, the organs cannot work normally. This is called dengue shock syndrome. \n\nPlasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding). If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding. With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract. When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever. ( \" Hemorrhage \" means \" dangerous bleeding. \" ) \n\nThe recovery stage is when the patient's body is overcoming the disease process. In this stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream. This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days. \n\nDuring this stage, people with dengue often feel much better. However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate. \n\nSerious problems can also happen during the recovery stage. If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, this can cause \" fluid overload. \" This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems. Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior). \n\nEvery once in a while, dengue can affect other systems in the body. For example, dengue can cause: \n\nAltered mental status: This happens in 0.5% to 6% of people with very bad dengue fever. It can happen when the dengue virus causes an infection in the brain. It can also happen when important organs, like the liver, are not working correctly because of dengue. \n\nNeurological disorders: These are problems with the brain and the nerves, like Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Post-dengue acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. \n\nInfection of the heart, or sudden liver failure (these are very uncommon). \n\nDengue fever is caused by the dengue virus. In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus. Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. \n\nDengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus, especially the Aedes aegypti species of mosquito. Aides aegypti is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals. A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite. \n\nSometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans. If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood. After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or \" spit \" ). Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus. When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue. \n\nA person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus. In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue. \n\nThe dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born. This is called vertical transmission. \n\nDengue is usually not spread in any other ways. \n\nOnce a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells. (The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.) As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself. The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body. These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue. \n\nIf a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body. Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow). The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally. This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen. \n\nBabies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick. Women are more likely than men to get very sick. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma. \n\nThere are four different types of the dengue virus. Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life. However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time. If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever. \n\nUsually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue. However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses. \n\nThe World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if: \n\nHe has a fever; AND \n\nHe has two of these symptoms: \n\n#Nausea and vomiting; \n\n#A rash; \n\n#Pain all over the body; \n\n#A low number of white blood cells; or \n\n#A positive tourniquet test. (To do this test, a doctor wraps a blood pressure cuff around a person's arm for five minutes, then counts any red spots on the skin. If the person has many spots, they are more likely to have dengue fever.) \n\nThe World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever. \n\nSome blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever. The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood. A low number of platelets can also signal dengue. Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus. However, these special tests are expensive. Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines. \n\nIt can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya. Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world. Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease. Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead. \n\nIn 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever. Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler. It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories. \n\nIn 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever. However, the older system often is still used. \n\nThe WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories: \n\nUndifferentiated fever \n\nDengue fever \n\nDengue hemorrhagic fever. This was then divided into four stages, called grades I-IV: \n\n#In Grade I, the person has a fever. He also bruises easily or has a positive tourniquet test. \n\n#In Grade II, the person bleeds into the skin and other parts of the body. \n\n##\tIn Grade III, the person shows signs of circulatory shock. This is called dengue shock syndrome. \n\n##\tIn Grade IV, the person has shock so severe that his blood pressure and heartbeat cannot be felt. This is a more serious version of dengue shock syndrome. \n\nIn 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types: \n\nUncomplicated: People who just have the febrile stage of dengue fever, and never go into the critical phase. They get better on their own or just need basic medical help. \n\nSevere: People who have symptoms that could kill them, or have serious complications from dengue. \n\nThere are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population. \n\nThe best way to control the mosquito is to get rid of its (the places it lives) The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move). Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay its eggs, to prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can: \n\nWear clothing that fully covers their skin \n\nUse bug spray \n\nUse mosquito netting when they are resting. \n\nThe WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an \" Integrated Vector Control \" program) that includes five different parts: \n\n#\tAdvocacy, people working together, and legislation (laws) should be used to make public health organizations and communities stronger. \n\n#\tAll parts of society should work together. This includes the public sector (like the government), the private sector (like businesses and corporations), and the health care field. \n\n#\tAll ways of controlling disease should be brought together. \n\n#\tDecisions should be make based on evidence. This will help make sure that the things that are done to address dengue are helpful. \n\n#\tAreas where dengue is a problem should be given help, so that they can build their abilities to respond well to the disease on their own. \n\nThere are no specific treatments for dengue fever. No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus. Health workers can give \" supportive treatment \" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better. \n\nDifferent people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms. Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better. \n\nTreating dehydration is very important. Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein. Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two. \n\nDoctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely. \n\nPeople with bad dengue may need blood transfusions. Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever). \n\nWhen people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body). If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid. \n\nMost people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward. \n\nWithout treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 100) die from dengue. With good treatment, less than 1% die. However, 26% of people with severe dengue die. \n\nDengue is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world. It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths around the world each year. However, the World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be. It calls dengue one of 16 \" neglected tropical diseases \" - diseases which do not get enough attention. In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost. This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis. However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures. \n\nDengue is becoming much more common around the world. It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods. In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960. Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because: \n\nMore people are living in cities. \n\nThere are more people in the world. The world's population is growing. \n\nMore people are travelling internationally (between countries). \n\nGlobal warming is thought to play a part in the increase in dengue. \n\nDengue happens most around the equator. 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens. 70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific. In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling. In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria. \n\nDengue fever is probably a very old disease. An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue. The book talked about a \" water poison \" that had to do with flying insects. \n\nWritten records from the 17th centur <nowiki/> y talk about what may have been epidemics of dengue (where the disease spread very quickly in a short time). The most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780. These reports talk about an epidemic that spread across Asia, Africa, and North America. From that time until 1940, there were not many more epidemics. \n\nIn 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infections from Aedes mosquitoes. In 1907, scientists showed that a virus causes dengue. This was just the second disease that was shown to be caused by a virus. (The first was yellow fever.) John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler kept studying the dengue virus, and figured out the basics of how the virus spreads. \n\nDengue began to spread much more quickly during and after World War II. Different types of dengue also spread to new areas. For the first time, people started to get dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever happened in the Philippines in 1953. By the 1970s, dengue hemorrhagic fever had become a major cause of death in children. It also spread to the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central America and South America in 1981. \n\nIt is not clear where the word \" dengue \" came from. Some people think that it comes from the Swahili phrase Ka-dinga pepo. This phrase talks about the disease being caused by an evil spirit. The Swahili word dinga is thought to come from the Spanish word dengue, which means \" careful. \" That word may have been used to describe a person having bone pain from dengue fever; that pain would make the person walk carefully. However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili word, and not the other way around. \n\nOther people think that the name \" dengue \" comes from the West Indies. In the West Indies, slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like \" a dandy. \" Because of this, the disease was also called \" dandy fever. \" \n\nThe name \" breakbone fever \" was first used by Benjamin Rush, a doctor and United States \" Founding Father. \" In 1789, Rush used the name \" breakbone fever \" in a report about the 1780 dengue outbreak in Philadelphia. In his official report, Rush mostly used the more formal name \" bilious remitting fever \" . \n\nThe term \" dengue fever \" was not commonly used until after 1828. Before that, different people used different names for the disease. For example, dengue was also called \" breakheart fever \" and \" la dengue. \" Other names were also used for severe dengue: for example, \" infectious thrombocytopenic purpura \" , \" Philippine, \" \" Thai, \" and \" Singapore hemorrhagic fever. \" \n\nScientists keep doing research on ways to prevent and treat dengue. People are also working on controlling mosquitoes, creating a vaccine, and creating drugs to fight the virus. \n\nMany simple things have been done to control mosquitoes. Some of these things have worked. For example, guppies (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods can be put in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae (eggs). \n\nScientists also keep working on creating antiviral drugs to treat attacks of dengue fever and keep people from getting severe complications. They are also working on figuring out how the virus's proteins are structured. This may help them create medications that work well for dengue. \n\n<span id= \" refGubler2010 \" class= \" citation \"> </span> \n\n<span id= \" refWHO2009 \" class= \" citation \"> </span>", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:44:48Z", "text_length": 24867}
{"title": "Coeliac disease", "parsed_text": "Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in people when the indigestion of Gluten leads to problems in the body. If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten (for example, wheat, rye, barley), cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine. This means that they cannot digest (eat) food properly, making them unable to have enough energy, vitamins, or minerals. Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly. People with coeliac disease often lose weight. They are also frequently tired. \n\nPeople with coeliac disease often have bloating and pain in their abdominal (stomach) area, diarrhoea (watery stools) or steatorrhea (fat in their stools). These symptoms can lead to flatulence. Their stomachs also start to hurt and they might suffer from joint pains, seizures, rashes, fatigue, slowness in growth and puberty, loss in weight, loss of bone density and fertility issues. \n\nTo relieve the effects of coeliac disease, one must stop eating gluten. There are no medicines or cure that can stop Coeliac disease. To get fully better, it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten, during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover. They must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition. \n\nCoeliac disease is genetic and relatives (such a children, siblings, parents) with this disease have a 1 in 10 chance of developing Coeliac disease. This means that the person affected by it is born with genes that cause the immune system to react poorly to gluten. However, Coeliac disease is not always present during childhood. It can be triggered as an adult by an event such as pregnancy (hormone shifts) or illness. \n\nTo find out if a person has Coeliac disease, doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten. The protein that attacks the intestine is called an antibody. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells, and they normally stop illnesses from growing in the body, but in the case of coeliac disease, one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness. Doctors can also look into the patient's intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope. This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged, because of coeliac disease. \n\nCeliac Disease Foundation \n\nWhat is Celiac Disease?", "timestamp": "2020-03-04T09:25:06Z", "text_length": 2724}

{"title": "Anal fissure", "parsed_text": "An anal fissure, or fissura ani, is a fissure (a small tear) in the anal canal. Patients typically complain of sharp anal pain during and after defecation, lasting minuters or hours . This small wound can sometimes bleed a little bit during or after defecation. \n\nIt's not completely clear what causes an anal fissure. It is possibly caused by constipation, too much strain on the anal sphincter (the circular muscle of the anus), reduced blood circulation, the skin is not made dry enough after taking a shower or swimming, the skin has been stretched too much, pregnancy, giving birth, and not changing a baby's diaper in time. \n\nAfter the anal fissure closes, it takes 6 weeks to 3 months before the wound is healed completely. In this period the fissure easily opens again. Therefore, the wound can return repeatedly . \n\nA doctor can prescribe several products to treat the anal fissure. For example, a pain relieving ointment or suppository (an anal medication); a laxative (that makes it easier to go to the toilet); zinc-ointment (this will protect the skin and contract it, so it will heal faster) . Further more a doctor can give advice about taking care of the wound and improve digestion and defecation. \n\nMost fissure are acute, lasting about 4-6 weeks . The anal fissure becomes chronic and will not go away if it lasts for more than 6 weeks. In such cases medical surgery can be a solution. The circular muscle of the anus is usually cut or stretched. Also an injection with botox in the muscle can have a positive result. \n\nThe anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing, for example during defecation. The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return. The advice includes the following tips. \n\nAs long as the fissure is open (a painful, small tear next to the anus which can bleed a little) the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide (protects and contracts) and pramoca\u00efne (relieves pain and itching) on and around the fissure (in Europe available without prescription as Nestosyl). Use toilet your finger with a glove to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap. This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again. \n\nBesides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation. The longer the faeces is in the intestine, the more liquid will be withdrawal. Because of this, the faeces will become harder and get more volume, and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again. Patients are advized to eat fibres every day (for example: unpolished rice, muesli, whole grain bread, dried apricots, figs, dates, prunes, saltless nuts, beans, peas, etc.); to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day; to use a little bit of butter or oil every day; to drink enough during the day; and to exercise every day. The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation (possible: white bread, white pasta/pizza/noodles, eggs, cheese, sugar, coffee, chocolate, etc.). If necessary, one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread. \n\nPatients should not postpone going to the toilet. While waiting, the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus, which causes a pressure. Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while. When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet, the best thing is to go immediately. While sitting on the toilet, the patient has to press as little as possible, but instead relax the circular muscle. \n\nAs long as the wound is not healed, taking a daily bath with soda (sodium carbonate) can give relief. Further more that will keep the wound clean. Sit in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water for 20 minutes, 2 or 3 times a day. This is called a sitz bath. It relaxes the tissue and helps relax the anal muscle . \n\nIt's very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed. The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily. \n\nSome patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus. For example, olive oil or sunflower oil. The skin softens and will not tear or crack as easily. Always remind hygiene. \n\nIf the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open, the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation. The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again. One can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper, baby wipes, or instead use warm water to clean himself after bowel movement. \n\nWhile following all mentioned tips and advice, do not forget the good principles of hygiene. \n\nThese recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure. If there is any doubt, especially when there is blood in the stool, please consult a doctor \n\n.", "timestamp": "2020-01-15T22:37:29Z", "text_length": 5205}

{"title": "Mania", "parsed_text": "Mania is a type of mood. Mania is usually a symptom of a medical problem or a mental illness. A person with mania is described as manic. \n\nWhen people are manic, they usually have much more energy than usual. They often have very strong emotions, and their moods may change very quickly. \n\nThe word \" mania \" comes from the Greek language (\u03bcwords\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 means mania). That word comes from \u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (mainomai), which means \" to rage \" or \" to be furious \" (very angry). \n\nMania is a symptom, not an illness by itself. Many different things can cause mania. These things include illegal drugs and brain tumors. However, most of the time, mania happens in people with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder causes periods of mania that switch off with periods of depression. \n\nLike with other symptoms, mania can be mild (not very bad), severe (very bad), or anywhere in between. Mild mania is usually called \" hypomania. \" Very bad mania can cause psychosis, with hallucinations and delusions. \n\nIn some cases, people with mania may need to be hospitalized so they do not hurt themselves or other people. On the other hand, many people with mania and hypomania have special creativity and artistic talents. \n\nThe most common symptoms of mania are: \n\nA mood that is either euphoric (very happy) or irritable (easily irritated or angered) \n\nBeing very talkative. This includes talking very quickly (pressured speech) and jumping from one idea to the next very quickly (flight of ideas). \n\nHaving an unusual amount of energy \n\nNot needing sleep \n\nBeing very hyper \n\nOther symptoms of mania can include: \n\nRacing thoughts, which can sometimes make it impossible for the person to concentrate on anything other than their thoughts \n\nActing impulsively (doing things without thinking them through), like spending a lot of money or having unsafe sex. People are more likely to put themselves in danger when they are manic. \n\nPhysical symptoms, like sweating, pacing, and losing weight \n\nHypersexuality (wanting to have sex much more than usual) \n\nDelusions, like: \n\nDelusions of grandeur: The person believes he is very important - for example, that he knows everything, or is famous, all-powerful, or very wealthy \n\nDelusions of potential: The person believes he can do things he cannot really do (for example, believing he can build a house on his own, when he has never built anything before) \n\nDelusions of persecution: The person believes other people are \" out to get him \" and are causing his problems on purpose \n\nIn the United States, a book called The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is used to diagnose mental illnesses. According to the latest version of the DSM, the DSM-5, a person is having a \" manic episode \" if all of these things are true: \n\nThe person's mood has been unusually euphoric or irritable for seven days or more \n\nThe person's mood changes are not caused by illegal drugs, medicine, or a medical illness \n\nThe person's mania is: \n\n#Causing them obvious problems at work, with family, or friends; OR \n\n#Making them psychotic; OR \n\n#Making them a danger to self or others \n\nIn addition, the person must also have three or more of these symptoms: \n\nInflated self-esteem or grandiosity (the person feels like he is very important and special) \n\nNeeds only a little sleep to feel rested \n\nMore talkative than usual; or the person seems like they have to keep talking (pressured speech) \n\nJumping from one idea to another; or the person feels like their thoughts are racing \n\nIncrease in \" goal-directed activity, \" like taking on big new projects; or \" psychomotor agitation \" (moving around a lot, unable to sit still) \n\nBeing easily distracted (the person's attention is drawn too easily to things that are not important) \n\nDoing a lot of activities that have a high risk of turning out badly (for example, spending a lot of money; going on sexual adventures) \n\nThe ICD-10 is the World Health Organization's system for classifying health problems. It describes a manic episode this way: \n\nThe person's mood is euphoric, and can change from being happy and carefree, to \" almost uncontrollable excitement \" \n\nThe person has an unusual amount of energy and is always doing some kind of activity \n\nThe person seems like they have to keep talking \n\nThe person does not seem to need sleep \n\nThe person cannot pay attention to anything, and gets distracted very easily \n\nOften, the person feels very important, is much more confident than usual, and has unreasonable ideas about what they can do (for example, they may feel like nothing can stop them from getting what they want) \n\nThe person does not have normal social inhibitions (a sense of what is right and appropriate to do around other people). This can lead to behavior that is inappropriate, reckless, and unusual for the person. \n\nMental illness \n\nMania is usually a symptom of mental illness, most often bipolar disorder. A diagnosis of type I bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder) can be made based on a single manic episode. This is the most common cause of mania. \n\nHowever, if a person is hypomanic, they may have type II bipolar disorder or cyclothymia. \n\nAlso, if a person has psychosis that lasts longer than their mania, they may have schizoaffective disorder. \n\nMedical causes \n\nMania is usually caused by a mental illness. However, some medical illnesses can cause symptoms of mania. Some doctors use the mnemonic E-MANIC to remember the possible medical causes of mania: \n\nEndocrine: Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or Cushing's syndrome can cause mania. (These are all problems with hormones in the body) \n\nMedications: Many different medications can have mania as side effects. These medications include amphetamines (often used to treat Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD); antidepressants; corticosteroids; opiate painkillers, and many others. \n\nAbuse of alcohol or illegal drugs: Alcohol and many other drugs can cause mania. These drugs include cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), inhalants, opiates, anabolic steroids, and MDMA (Ecstasy). \n\nNeurologic problems: Many different problems with the brain can cause mania. For example, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease can all cause manic symptoms. \n\nInfection: Infections in the brain can cause mania. Examples include meningitis, brain infections caused by HIV/AIDS, and neurosyphilis (the last stage of syphilis, when the disease reaches the brain) \n\nCardiovascular causes and Cerebrovascular accidents (strokes) \n\nNot having enough vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 deficiency) can also cause mania and psychosis. \n\nIf mania is caused by a medical problem, the best thing to do is to treat that medical problem. \n\nIf mania is caused by a mental illness, the best treatment is a combination of medicines and psychotherapy (talking with a therapist or counselor). \n\nDoctors usually treat mania with a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medicines. While taking these medicines, the patient should see their doctor regularly to be checked for side effects. \n\nWhen the symptoms of mania have ended, long-term treatment then focuses on preventative treatment. The goal of this kind of treatment is to prevent periods of mania or depression from happening. Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy. Medication works best for bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses, when it is combined with other treatments like psychotherapy. \n\nAbnormal psychology \n\nBipolar disorder \n\nClinical depression \n\nExpert Opin Pharmacother. 2001 Dec;2(12):1963\u201373. \n\nSchizoaffective Disorder. 2007 Sept.

Most of the time, this manifests in anemia - not having enough blood. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can also cause hemorrhages and infections with fever. \n\nMost of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older, but younger people can get it too, especially if they went through a form of chemotherapy.

{"title": "Swine influenza", "parsed_text": "Swine influenza virus is a virus that is common in pigs. This type of influenza virus can also infect humans and birds. Swine influenza virus is sometimes called SIV or swine flu. \n\nSwine flu is common in pigs. Normally, it only infects people who have been in close contact with pigs. However, the disease has also spread from one person to another. Swine flu can cause fever, disorientation (not being clear-headed), stiffness of the joints, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Sometimes this ends in death. \n\nThere are different types, or strains, of swine flu. They are called H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3. \n\nH1N1 came from the Spanish flu, which caused a pandemic in humans in 1918 and 1919. \n\n</ref> New viruses came from the Spanish flu. These viruses became common in pigs. Every once in a while, the viruses spread from pigs to humans. This has happened during the 20th century. (However, they happened at the same time as the flu epidemics that happen every year. Because of this, it is hard to tell the difference between 'normal' influenza and swine influenza.) Infections that spread from pigs to humans are rare. Scientists only know of 12 known cases in the United States since 2005. \n\nIt is very difficult to prevent the flu virus. This is because the virus changes all the time. If a person gets the flu, his body forms antibodies to fight that virus off if it happens again. But since the flu virus changes all the time, a person's antibodies do not recognize the virus the next time it happens, because it is different. The same thing happens with vaccines. \n\nThe changes in the flu virus can cause a flu pandemic. For example, the virus might only change a little bit in about two to three years. After about ten years, most people will have developed antibodies to fight these small changes. But if the virus then changes a lot, there can be a pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people suddenly realize that the antibodies they developed are useless. Even during the Spanish flu pandemic, the first wave of the disease was relatively mild, while the second wave was very deadly. \n\nIn 1957, an Asian flu pandemic infected about 45 million Americans and killed 70,000. Eleven years later, from 1968 to 1969, the Hong Kong flu pandemic infected 50 million Americans and caused 33,000 deaths. It also cost about $3.9 billion. In 1976, about 500 soldiers became infected with swine flu over a few weeks. However, by the end of the month, investigators found that the virus had \" mysteriously disappeared \" , and there were no more signs of swine flu anywhere on the post. There were a small number of isolated (far-apart) cases around the U.S. However, these were in people who were thought to have caught the virus from pigs. \n\nScientists fear the swine flu virus might mutate, or change, into a pandemic as deadly as the 1918/1919 pandemic. They watched the outbreak in 2009, and made plans about what to do if a global pandemic breaks out. \n\nThe main symptoms of the swine influenza is much the same as regular influenza. Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, runny nose, (loss of appetite), lethargy (feeling tired), chills, fever, body aches, sore throat, coughing, diarrhea, and stomach ache. \n\nThe bird flu virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China. It has recently been found in pigs in Vietnam. Specialists also think that this might lead to new variations of the influenza virus. \n\n</ref> Pigs can carry human influenza viruses. These viruses can combine in new ways, and exchange certain genes with H5N1. Through mutation, this would create a form of the virus that can pass easily among humans. \n\n</ref> H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. \n\n</ref> In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs. \n\n</ref> \n\nIn 2005 it was discovered that H5N1 could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of Indonesia, but without showing symptoms. Chairul Nidom, a virologist at Airlangga University's tropical disease center in Surabaya, East Java, did some independent research: he tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java where avian flu had broken out, Nature reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative. \n\n</ref> \n\nReport on pigs as carriers </ref> \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a United States government agency, reports that the symptoms and transmission of the swine flu from human to human is much like seasonal flu. Usually, the symptoms are fever, lethargy (feeling tired), lack of appetite and coughing. Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. It is believed to be spread between humans when an infected person coughs or sneezes and then touches something. Another person then might touch the same thing with the virus on it and then touch their own nose or mouth. The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people, most commonly children, can be contagious for up to ten days. Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen (sample), collected during the first five days, to the CDC for analysis. \n\nThe Swine Flu is susceptible to four licensed drugs in the United States, amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, for the 2009 outbreak, it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir. The vaccine for the human seasonal flu does not protect against the swine flu. Even if the virus strains are the same specific variety, the antigenicity is very different. \n\nThe virus has evolved in recent decades. This has made Swine influenza a bigger problem, mainly because traditional vaccines against influenza do not always work against Swine influenza. There are special vaccines against Swine influenza, but they only work if the virus strain is similar to some extent. In the cases more difficult to treat, special vaccines are produced. These are very similar, as they are made to match the specific virus strain. \n\n</ref> \n\n</ref> \n\nPresent vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms, typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of non-reactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. \n\n</ref> \n\nThe current vaccine against the seasonal influenza strain H1N1 is thought unlikely to provide protection. \n\n</ref> The director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that the United States' cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses\u2014North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe. On two cases, a complete genome sequence had been obtained. She said that the virus is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, but susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). \n\n</ref> \n\n</ref> \n\n</ref> \n\nA new strain of swine influenza A called H1N1 was responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans. It came from a combination of several strains of influenza in humans and influenza in birds and swine influenza. Tests were done. Testers found that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses that had already been found in pigs in the United States since 1999, but the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (M) genes resembled versions in European swine. Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before. There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States, however. \n\n</ref> \n\nIn 2009, the government of Egypt ordered over 300,000 pigs killed to prevent the spread of H1N1, even though experts said the pigs were not going to spread H1N1 anyway. Most of the pigs' owners were not paid for their dead pigs. \n\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization made itself some rules for naming viruses: No official name is allowed to refer to a place, person or animal. This is to prevent stigma, or blame. The WHO rules list \" swine flu \" as an example of what not to do when naming a virus or disease. \n\nAvian influenza \n\nPandemic \n\nList of epidemics \n\nInfectious disease \n\n\" Swine Flu Cases Without Swine Exposure \" Center for Biosecurity of UPMC \n\nSwine Flu h1n1 \n\nThe Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease Original 1978 U.S.A.

{"title": "Asperger syndrome", "parsed_text": "Asperger syndrome (often Asperger's syndrome) is a form of autism spectrum disorder. It affects the way in which a person understands, talks and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people, and may be unable to act like everyone else in different social situations. Neurotypical (or NT) is a term that was coined in the autistic community as a label for those other people who are not on the autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is thought to manifest as a developmental disorder, and is not considered a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work, and live successful lives. Asperger syndrome is considered to be at the highest functioning end of the Autism spectrum disorders. \n\nAsperger syndrome is not a disease. People who have it will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. However, they can try many solutions to help them and learn how to be able to reduce the impact in their life. One solution can be medication to restrict the different symptoms like aggression. The big problem with people affected by Asperger's is that they cannot understand emotions or how people think. Therapists attempt to help the person with that. They will do many activities like acting an emotion and let the Asperger people guess what it is. \n\nAsperger syndrome may be observed and diagnosed in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain which controls a person's \" social behavior \" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism. \n\nAsperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with \" tics \" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, and coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD and/or OCD. It has been estimated that beyond half of the people with the syndrome, also carries some other type of syndrome, disorder, disability, disease, or illness. The MSD Manual says \" strong evidence supports a genetic component \" . \n\nPeople who have Asperger syndrome have normal to high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome. \n\nPeople with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time fitting in with other people. This social awkwardness has been called \" active but odd \" . Adults who have it usually learn enough \" coping skills \" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people. People who carry the syndrome can sometimes seem rude or uninterested during conversations, without meaning anything wrong. They may also get stressed or unsettled when things does not go their way. \n\nAsperger's syndrome characteristics include: \n\nEngaging in long, one-sided conversations, without noticing if the listener is listening or trying to change the subject \n\nDisplaying unusual nonverbal communication, such as lack of eye contact, few facial expressions, or awkward body postures and gestures \n\nShowing an intense obsession with one or two specific, narrow subjects, such as baseball statistics, train schedules, weather or snakes \n\nAppearing not to understand, empathize with, or be sensitive to others' feelings \n\nHaving a hard time \" reading \" other people or understanding humor \n\nSpeaking in a voice that is monotonous, rigid, or unusually fast \n\nMay prefer to be alone \n\nGets stuck in their own heads \n\nHas strange thoughts and prejudices about the outside world \n\nShows problems in meeting new people \n\nDoes not enjoy instant changes \n\nFeels uncomfortable around people, usually strangers \n\nHas an eye for details and notices the small things \n\nFollows their own habits, routines, and traditions, for example; always buying the same type of food and drink, or listening to the same song over and over again \n\nAsperger syndrome is noticeable when the person acts differently in social situations. Their social disabilities can have different levels. It\u2019s not everybody who have Asperger syndrome that have the same level. This characteristic is not the only one. Someone who dislikes people in general does not necessarily have Aspergers. Other characteristics that can be identified are that Asperger people hate any changes in their routine. They also dislike having eye contact. Most of the time they will try to avoid it. They will look away. Usually people who deal with Asperger syndrome have less facial expression than anybody else. There are many characteristics. If someone only has some of these characteristics, there is probably no problem with them. Commonly, people with the syndrome tends to hum or pronounce different sounds to themselves, which they have heard in their surroundings, such as a reporters's voice, a man on the radio, lyrics from songs, words, things they have read, or what people around them usually says. They may repeatedly mention these words or phrases again and again. \n\nIn the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children that were different from most other children that he knew, but were like each other. He called them \" little professors \" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his \" little professors \" had a different sort of personality. \n\nIn the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name \" Asperger syndrome \" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work. \n\nIn 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). \n\nIn 2013 Asperger syndrome was removed from the DSM. \n\nAsperger's is one of many separate ICD Autistic Disorders that is still diagnosable using the ICD but can be found in the DSM as Autism Spectrum Disorder or Autistic Disorder; and is often referred to as Autistic Spectrum Disorder for clarity. Providers that use the DSM can; document and reference your ICD Autistic Disorder, provide you the additional DSM Autistic Disorder, and or provide a combination of the two labels (e.g Autistic Spectrum Disorder \" Asperger's \" 299.00 (F84.0), With Specific Learning Disorder, Mild). \n\nAsperger syndrome is much more common in males than females. Statistics say that three males are affected for every one female. \n\nIt is widely discussed how common the syndrome is, as there are figures that show very different numbers. But, it probably lies between 1 in every 250, all the way up to 1 in every 10,000. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1. \n\nSpectrumville: A Forum for People on the Autism Spectrum \n\nWebMD Reference pages for Asperger syndrome \n\nNeurodiversity website History and information on people with Asperger syndrome \n\nWrong Planet designed for individuals (and parents / professionals of those) with Autism, Asperger Syndrome, ADHD, PDDs, and other neurological differences. \n\nAspies Central A friendly community for Asperger, Autism & other associates even for those not on the spectrum. \n\nAsperclick A forum specifically for AS, but open to other ASDs.", "timestamp": "2020-05-30T02:39:27Z", "text_length": 9634}

{"title": "Borderline personality disorder", "parsed_text": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a long-term mental illness. It is a type of cluster B personality disorder. People diagnosed with BPD are often very impulsive, and generally have a low self-esteem. Moods often change quickly. For these reasons, these people often have trouble keeping a stable relationship. Frequently, people with BPD also suffer from other conditions, such as clinical depression or they show self-harming behavior. Treating people with BPD is difficult, and is usually done using a combination of therapy and drugs. \n\nC.H.Huges used the term \" Borderland \" , to describe a number of conditions bordering mental health issues. Adolf Stern gave a description of some of the symptoms in 1938, and called them \" border line group \" . People showed both conditions related to psychosis, and related to neurosis, so the term was thought fitting, at the time. \n\nPeople diagnosed with BPD have strong mood swings. They see things as \" all good \" or \" all bad \" (splitting), and are frequently confused about their identity. They usually have a lot of trouble with relationships with people. They have strong emotions which often change quickly. They are often reckless, destructive or self-destructive. \n\nPeople with BPD feel emotions more easily, more deeply and for longer than others do. <sup> [10][11] </sup> Emotions may repeatedly return and last a long time. <sup> [11] </sup> Because of this, it may take longer than normal for people with BPD to return to a normal and stable emotional state. <sup> [12] </sup> This can have both positive and negative effects. <sup> [12] </sup> People with BPD are often very happy and loving. <sup> [13] </sup> People with BPD are also often sad and mad. They feel emotions in a stronger way than most people - grief instead of sadness, rage instead of being annoyed, and panic instead of being anxious. <sup> [13] </sup> People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of being abandoned, being alone, and being a \" failure \" . They are often aware of how strong their emotions are, and, since they cannot control them, they sometimes shut them down entirely. <sup> [12] </sup> \n\nTheir emotions are intense and their emotions are also quick to change. The most common mood swings they have are between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety. <sup> [17] </sup> \n\nPeople with BPD often act impulsively, which means they do things or say things without thinking. This behavior can be dangerous, and includes: abusing drugs or alcohol, eating too much or too little, having unsafe sex or frequent sex with multiple partners, spending a lot of money, and driving dangerously. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away and self-injury. <sup> [19] </sup> \n\nPeople with BPD sometimes act impulsively because it gives them instant relief from their emotional pain. <sup> [19] </sup> However, in the long term people with BPD go through more pain from the shame and guilt that follow these actions. <sup> [19] </sup> A cycle often begins where people with BPD feels emotional pain and acts impulsively to relieve that pain. Then they feel bad about what they did, and have strong urges to act impulsively to relieve the new pain. <sup> [19] </sup> As time goes on, impulsive behavior may start to be an automatic reaction to emotional pain. <sup> [19] </sup> \n\nSelf-injury is common for people with BPD. Sometimes people hurt themselves without wanting to commit suicide. Common methods include cutting, burning, head banging, and drug overdose. The reasons people with BPD give for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are different from their reasons for suicide attempts. Reasons they give for hurting themselves include expressing anger, punishing themselves, creating normal feelings, and distracting themselves from emotional pain or difficult situations. When suicide is the goal, they usually attempt suicide with the belief that others will be better off without them. Both suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury are a response to feeling negative emotions. \n\nPeople with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them. They can feel very happy and grateful when they feel someone has been nice to them, and very sad or angry when they feel someone has been hurtful to them. Their feelings about others often switch from positive to negative if they feel like they might lose someone, if they think someone important to them does not care about them, or if something is not as good as they expected. They think in extremes, seeing things or people as \" all good \" or \" all bad \" . This is sometimes called black-and-white thinking. It includes a change from admiring someone to devaluing them, often feeling pure anger or dislike. <sup> [28] </sup> The way they see themselves can also change quickly from positive to negative. \n\nWhile strongly wanting to feel closeness, people with BPD tend to be anxious, have mixed feelings, or be paranoid when it comes to their relationships. They often view the world as dangerous and bad. BPD is linked to high levels of stress and conflict in romantic relationships, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy. These things are also common with other types of personality disorders. \n\nPeople with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. It is difficult for them to know what they value and love. <sup> [35] </sup> They often do not know about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. They often have trouble making decisions and can change their minds quickly. These difficulties can cause people with BPD to feel \" empty \" and \" lost \" . <sup> [35] </sup> \n\nPeople with BPD are easily bored and it is hard for them to concentrate. <sup> [35] </sup> People with BPD may tend to disconnect or \" dissociate \" from people and things around them, which can be thought of as an intense form of \" zoning out \" . <sup> [36] </sup> This often happens in response to a painful event, or something that triggers the memory of a painful event. This can give make the person feel better for a short time, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking ordinary feelings. This has the result of keeping people with BPD from learning how to handle these feelings, and can make it difficult for them to make positive choices when they feel these emotions. <sup> [36] </sup> Sometimes other people can see when someone with BPD is dissociating because the expressions in their face or voice can seem emotionless, or they look like they are distracted. Sometimes when someone with BPD is dissociating, other people are not able to see or know that it is happening. <sup> [36] </sup> \n\nPsychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with BPD using a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has five or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have BPD. \n\nFearing and trying very hard to prevent being left or rejected \n\nA pattern of trouble in relationships, often thinking that other people are much better or much worse than they really are and changing quickly between the two views. \n\nBeing confused about their own personal identity \n\nBeing impulsive in ways that are dangerous (such as casual sex, drinking too much alcohol or abusing drugs, not eating or eating too much, driving dangerously) \n\nTrying to commit suicide, or hurting themselves \n\nMood swings - suddenly feeling very happy, sad or anxious, and feeling that way for hours at a time \n\nFeeling empty inside or constantly feeling bored \n\nHaving intense anger problems, getting into many fights \n\nHaving severe paranoid thoughts \n\nNearly all people with BPD also have other mental health problems, such as: mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders (especially post-traumatic stress disorder), and other personality disorders. Most have or have had substance abuse and/or addictions. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are also common. \n\nOther illnesses that often happen with BPD include diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. \n\nThe cause for BPD is not known. There may be several causes for people developing BPD. Some researchers think that it might be caused by trauma in childhood, such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. Many people with BPD were abused when they were children. Modern thinking as demonstrated by functioning MRI scans is that neurotransmitters within the brain are not working correctly, and messages are not conducted in the usual way. \n\nTreating BPD is very difficult and takes a long time. Today, most people with BPD are treated with different kinds of psychotherapy. One of these is called dialectical behavioral therapy. In addition to therapy, drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are often used. Many sufferers recover within 10 years. \n\nKings and Queens of Chaos; A new understanding of borderline personality suggests new ways of handling it.

These thoughts, feelings and behaviours can cause problems for the person, and for other people around them. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries, personality disorders are classed as a kind of mental disorder and are treated by medical professionals. About ten percent of adults have PDs. \n\nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a book about mental illness written by the American Psychiatric Association, there are ten personality disorders.

They are: \n\nAntisocial personality disorder: these people habitually victimize. They do not care about people or the law. Around three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD. It is the most common PD in men. \n\nBorderline personality disorder: these people have unstable relationships, self-image and moods. They are very impulsive. Around one percent of men and three percent of women have BPD. \n\nHistrionic personality disorder: these people are very emotional and need to be the center of attention. They are flirtatious and seductive. Around one percent of men and four percent of women have HPD. It is the most common PD in women. \n\nNarcissistic personality disorder: these people think that they are better than other people. They boast about themselves and need other people to look up to them. They use other people to achieve their goals. Around one percent of people have NPD; it is more common in men. \n\nAll Cluster B disorders are comorbid with each other. There are things that are in more than one PD. For example, selfishness and lack of empathy are major parts of ASPD and NPD. Needing to be admired is a major part of HPD and NPD. \n\nCluster C is the anxious or fearful group of personality disorders.

Putting their feet up, or bending their knees, is also helpful. This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing). Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint. \n\nDoctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure. Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration. This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) get fluids through a needle placed into a vein. \n\nIf low blood pressure is caused by medicines, doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much. \n\nThere are also medications that increase blood pressure.

{"title": "Pneumothorax", "parsed_text": "Pneumothorax (sometimes called \" collapsed lung \" ) is a health problem where air or gas is in the pleural space (the space between the lung and the pleura). The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs. The two parts of the pleura usually touch. A hole might grow in the surface of the lung. Air then enters between the pleura and the lung. The lung will collapse. If enough air gets into the pleural space, it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest, like the heart or the aorta. Pneumothorax is a medical emergency. \n\nThere are two main types of pneumothorax. These are a Closed Pneumothorax, and an Open Pneumothorax. These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax. \n\nThe most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains. The chest pains can be sharp, dull, or stabbing. Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and coughing. \n\nA Pneumothorax can occur for no obvious reason (spontaneous). It is typically men who are tall (or perhaps have long torsos), between the ages of 20 and 40 who present a spontaneous pneumothorax. \n\nSmall air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the surface of the lungs. These blebs sometimes burst \u2014 allowing air to leak into the pleural space that surrounds the lungs, causing the lung to collapse. \n\nOtherwise, it can be caused by blunt or penetrating injuries or lung diseases that result in the lung leaking air into the pleural cavity. \n\nConsuming cannabis via smoking is also related to victims of a pneumothorax. \n\nSimple Pneumothorax will heal by itself. Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention. One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur. \n\nClosed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound. This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow, like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs. Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus. The mucus blocks ducts and passageways. \n\nThe most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax. The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known. \n\nOpen pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest. This can happen with stab wounds, like from a knife. It can also happen after a gunshot injury. The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person (or animal) breathes, but does not let it back out.

People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking. \n\nThought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness, but there can also be other causes for it. \n\nThe condition it describes is permanent. It affects speech and writing. Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence. They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as 'word salad'. \n\nEugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process. However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language.

It says that binge drinking is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) to 0.08 or more. Blood alcohol content is the percentage of ethanol in the person's blood. (In the United States, a BAC of 0.08 means a person is legally drunk.) This means that a person would be binge drinking if: \n\nA usual adult man had five or more drinks in about two hours \n\nA usual adult woman had four or more drinks in about two hours. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Health Service says that binge drinking is having \" eight or more units [of alcohol] in a single [drinking] session for men and six or more for women. \" (Units are used in the United Kingdom to measure alcohol.) This means a person would be binge drinking if: \n\nA usual adult man drank four glasses of wine, or three and a half pints of beer, in a single drinking session \n\nA usual adult woman drank three glasses of wine, or three pints of beer, in a single drinking session \n\nA recent report paid for by the European Union suggested that binge drinking should be defined, across Europe, as drinking \" 60g alcohol (men) and 40g alcohol (women) in a period of about two hours. \" \n\nBinge drinking can be dangerous. It can cause alcohol poisoning. If a person drinks too much, they can stop breathing and die.

{"title": "Ketosis", "parsed_text": "Ketosis occurs when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver. Ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acid. Ketosis can be understood as the use of body fat as a source of energy. \n\nThe body goes through ketosis when there is not enough carbohydrate to refill glycogen in the liver. An example of this kind of diet is the Atkins diet, where followers start by eating fewer than 20g of carbohydrates per day. It takes 48 hours for the brain to switch from glucose to ketone bodies. Ketosis helps the body prevent using protein, from muscles, for gluconeogenesis to make glucose. \n\nKetosis \n\nIn essence, a ketogenic diet mimics\u00a0starvation, allowing the body to go into a metabolic state called ketosis (key-tow-sis). Normally, human bodies are sugar-driven machines: ingested carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is mainly transported and used as energy or stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue. When deprived of dietary carbohydrates (usually below 50g/day), the liver becomes the sole provider of glucose to feed your hungry organs \u2013 especially the brain, a particularly greedy entity accounting for ~20% of total energy expenditure. The brain cannot DIRECTLY use fat for energy. Once liver glycogen is depleted, without a backup energy source, humanity would\u2019ve long disappeared in the eons of evolution. \n\nThe backup is ketone bodies that the liver derives primarily from fatty acids in your diet or body fat. These ketones \u2013 ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate and acetone \u2013 are released into the bloodstream, taken up by the brain and other organs, shuttled into the \u201cenergy factory\u201d mitochondria and used up as fuel. Excess BHB and acetoacetate are excreted from urine, while acetone, due to its volatile nature, is breathed out (hence the characteristically sweet \u201cketo breath\u201d). Meanwhile, blood glucose remains physiologically normal due to glucose derived from certain amino acids and the breakdown of fatty acids \u2013 voila, low blood sugar avoided! \n\nCarbohydrate restriction induces the pancreas to \" tell \" fat cells to release fatty acids, which get taken up by the liver and converted into ketones and released into blood. Once taken up by the brain, ketones enter the TCA cycle to generate energy. Source: Shelly Fan. (click to see large) \n\nBrain on ketones: Energetics, Oxidation and Inflammation \n\nSo the brain is happily deriving energy from ketones \u2013 sure, but why would this be protective against such a variety of brain diseases? \n\nOne answer may be energy. Despite their superficial differences, many neurological diseases share one major problem \u2013 deficient energy production. During metabolic stress, ketones serve as an alternative energy source to maintain normal brain cell metabolism. In fact, BHB (a major ketone) may be an even more efficient fuel than glucose, providing more energy per unit oxygen used. A ketogenic diet also increases the number of mitochondria, so called \u201cenergy factories\u201d in brain cells.\u00a0A recent study\u00a0found enhanced expression of genes encoding for mitochondrial enzymes and energy metabolism in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for learning and memory. Hippocampal cells often degenerate in age-related brain diseases, leading to cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. With increased energy reserve, neurons may be able to ward off disease stressors that would usually exhaust and kill the cell. \n\nA ketogenic diet may also DIRECTLY inhibit a major source of neuronal stress, by -well- acting like a blueberry. Reactive oxygen species are unfortunate byproducts of cellular metabolism. Unlike the gas Oxygen, these \u201coxidants\u201d have a single electron that makes them highly reactive, bombarding into proteins and membranes and wrecking their structure. Increased oxidants are a hallmark of aging, stroke and neurodegeneration. \n\nKetones directly inhibit the production of these violent molecules, and enhance their breakdown through increasing the activity of glutathione peroxidase, a part of our innate anti-oxidant system. The low intake of carbohydrates also directly reduces glucose oxidation (something called \u201cglycolysis\u201d). Using a glucose-like non-metabolized analogue,\u00a0one studyfound that neurons activate stress proteins to lower oxidant levels and stabilize mitochondria. \n\nDue to its high fat nature, keto increases poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, such as DHA and EPA, both sold over-the-counter as \u201cbrain healthy\u201d supplements), which in turn reduces oxidant production and inflammation. Inflammatory stress is another \u201croot of all evil\u201d, which PUFAs target by inhibiting the expression of genes encoding for pro-inflammatory factors. \n\nNeurons on Ketones: \n\nExcited neurons transmit signals, process information and form the basis of a functioning brain. OVER-excited neurons tend to die. \n\nThe brain teeters on a balance between excitation and inhibition through two main neurotransmitters, the excitatory glutamate and the inhibitory GABA. Tilt the scale towards glutamate, which occurs in stroke, seizures and neurodegeneration, and you get excitotoxicity. In other words, hyper-activity is toxic. \n\nBack in the 1930s, researchers found that direct injection of various ketone bodies into rabbits prevented chemically-induced seizures through inhibiting glutamate release, but the precise mechanism was unclear.\u00a0A recent study\u00a0in hippocampal neurons showed that ketones directly inhibited the neuron\u2019s ability to \u201cload up\u201d on glutamate \u2013 that is, the transmitter can\u2019t be packaged into vesicles and released \u2013 and thus decreased excitatory transmission. In a model of epilepsy that used a chemical similar to glutamate to induce damage, the diet\u00a0protected miceagainst cell death in the hippocampus by inhibiting pro-death signaling molecules. On the other end of the excitation-inhibition balance,\u00a0ketones increase GABA\u00a0in the synapses (where neurotransmitters are released) of rats and in the brains of some (but not all)\u00a0epileptic humans subjects. This increase in inhibition may confer both anti-seizure effects and neuroprotection, though data is still scant. \n\nThen there are some fringe hypotheses. The acidity of ketones may decrease the pH of certain brain microdomains, which\u00a0might be the mechanism\u00a0of keto\u2019s positive effect on Type II Bipolar disorder (lots of mays and mights, I know). As keto affects the whole body, global changes due to calorie restriction and regulation of the satiety hormone Leptin are bound to alter brain function, and play a circumstantial role. \n\nevidence ketosis are neuroprotector . \n\nAll these molecular changes suggest that a ketogenic diet is protective against brain injury. But is there any REAL evidence? \n\nA study\u00a0with 23 elderly with mild cognitive impairment showed that a ketogenic diet improved verbal memory performance after 6 weeks compared to a standard high carbohydrate diet. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled\u00a0study, 152 patients with mild- to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease were given either a ketogenic agent or a placebo, while maintaining a normal diet. 90 days later, those receiving the drug showed marked cognitive improvement compared to placebo, which was correlated with the level of ketones in the blood. \n\nIn a pilot study\u00a0in 7 patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, 5 were able to stick to the diet for 28 days and showed marked reduction in their physical symptoms. In\u00a0an animal model\u00a0of Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a ketogenic diet also led to delayed motor neuron death and histological and functional improvements, although it did not increase life span; clinical trials are\u00a0on the way. \n\nRemarkably, a long-term ketogenic diet does not seem to be associated with\u00a0significant side effects, although constipation, dehydration and electrolyte and micronutrient deficiencies are common complaints. More serious complications include increased chance of kidney stones, gallbladder problems and bone fractures, especially in children. Menstrual irregularities often occur in women, with potential impact on fertlity. Although ketoacidosis \u2013 acidification of the blood due to pathological levels of ketones \u2013 was historically proposed as a side effect, nutritional ketosis simply cannot achieve the level of ketones required to induce this life-threatening state. Nevertheless, there are no studies directly monitoring the side effects of ketosis yet, hence it\u2019s too early to conclude that the diet is completely safe for everyone.", "timestamp": "2016-11-15T21:31:30Z", "text_length": 8537}

It is normal what a person's weights changes over time. Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score, based on height and weight. If this score is below 18.5, a person is generally said to be underweight. This is only a general indication, though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone. It does not apply to children and adolescents, for example. \n\nBeing underweight can have different causes: \n\nMalnutrition, not eating enough, or eating the wrong kinds of foods.

{"title": "Type 1 diabetes", "parsed_text": "Diabetes mellitus type 1, also called type 1 diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that results in high blood sugar. This is because the body cannot create enough of the hormone insulin. People with this condition are insulin dependent - they require insulin injections without which they may die. People with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk of stroke, heart disease or gangrene. About 15% of people with diabetes have type 1. \n\nType 1 diabetes is a condition caused by a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone produced by cells in the pancreas. Insulin is responsible for moving sugars out of the blood and into cells to be used for energy. If insulin is not made, the body will search for other ways to get the sugars needed to feed the body's cells, including breaking down muscle and fat, leading to a loss of weight. \n\nInsulin is not being produced in the pancreas due to an autoimmune condition attacking its cells. The body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas, the beta cell, damaging the cells in a way the prevents them from producing more insulin. As more and more cells are damaged, less insulin is produced in the body. This means that more sugar remains in the bloodstream rather than being moved into cells. This high blood sugar causes the symptoms seen in type 1 diabetes. Daneman D (2006). Type 1 diabetes. The Lancet 367(9513): 847-858 \n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606683414 \n\n</ref> \n\nThe disease is thought to be strongly linked to genetic factors, but the trigger that starts the autoimmune disease is not currently known. \n\nIn the past, type 1 diabetes was generally thought to be a disorder in children and teenagers. However, it's now been found that adults can be diagnosed with the disease. \n\nAlthough type 1 diabetes can now be diagnosed at any age, it is one of the most common chronic conditions in children and young adults. Being diagnosed at ages 5\u20137 or at the start of puberty is particularly common. Type 1 diabetes is also slightly more common in boys. \n\nCases of type 1 diabetes have been increasing across the world for several decades. Approximately 1 in 300 people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by the age of 18 in the United States. If this rate continues, the number of cases of type 1 diabetes could double in the next decade. \n\nIn type 1 diabetes, symptoms generally develop over a few days or weeks, though may take longer in adults. The main symptoms are: \n\n- Feeling very thirsty \n\n- Urinating more often then normal, especially at night \n\n- Exhaustion \n\n- Loss of weight \n\n- Itchiness around the genital area \n\n- Blurring of sight \n\n- Slow healing of wounds and grazes \n\nNausea, vomiting and heavy breathing are more serious symptoms. They occur at a later stage in the disease, and if they're seen a sufferer should be taken to hospital immediately. \n\nSufferers of type 1 diabetes may have to deal with both short-term and long-term complications, particularly if the disease is not well managed. \n\nHypoglycaemia is when blood sugar levels decrease to below normal. This is most commonly due to overuse of medications for diabetes type 1 like insulin or from poor diet control. The risk of suffering from low blood sugar is increased by drinking alcohol. Leads to various symptoms, including confusion, loss of consciousness, clumsiness, seizures or death. \n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a very serious complication of type 1 diabetes. It is always a medical emergency and requires rapid medical attention to prevent further damage to a patient, if left untreated it can potentially lead to death. DKA occurs when there is not enough insulin in the body to supply sugars to the body's cells. In order to give its cells enough energy to survive, the body begins to produce acidic ketone bodies which are then used to feed energy to the cells. \n\nIf too many ketone bodies build up the blood becomes acidic, damaging the body and leading to the symptoms: \n\n- Vomiting \n\n- Dehydration \n\n- Difficult breathing \n\n- Fast heartbeat \n\n- Confusion \n\n- Coma \n\nIf diabetes is not treated, even mildly raised blood sugar levels can damage nerves, organs and blood vessels in the body . \n\nDiabetic retinopathy, damage to the blood vessels prevent enough blood from reaching the eye. This can lead the eye's retina being damaged, resulting in loss of vision or blindness. \n\nDiabetic neuropathy, damage to blood vessels near nerves can result in reduced blood flow. This can damage the nerves, leading to a loss in the sense of touch, normally starting from the hands or feet, before spreading up the body. \n\nDiabetic nephropathy, blood vessels in the kidney become damaged, making the kidney work less effectively. In sever cases. this can result in kidney failure. \n\nSexual dysfunction \n\nIncreased risk of heart disease and stroke \n\nNarrowing of blood vessels (peripheral arterial disease). \n\nDiabetic foot, narrowing of blood vessels reduces sensitivity and slows wound healing in the foot. If not managed appropriately, can lead to ulceration and gangrene in the foot. In very severe cases, amputation may be required. \n\nCurrently, there is no known cure for diabetes. Instead, treatment is designed to help keep blood sugar levels normal in order to reduce the chances of complications developing as the disease progresses. There are two main method that are combined to manage diabetes type 1: \n\nHealthy eating: eating a diet focused on fruit and vegetables, whilst limiting fats, salt and sugar helps keep blood sugar levels in check. \n\nExercise: regular physical activity helps to lower your blood sugar level. A good goal to aim for is 150 minutes of exercise a week. \n\nStopping smoking: smoking further increases the risk of heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke. Stopping or reducing smoking will reduce the risk of these complications. \n\nReducing alcohol: alcohol can either raise or lower blood sugar, and makes it difficult to monitor your own blood sugar levels. Drinking alcohol in moderation can reduce these risks. \n\nType 1 diabetes occurs due to the bodies inability to produce its own insulin. To counter this, insulin can be injected into the blood manually. When diabetes is first diagnosed, a plan should be made for insulin treatment in order to not under or overdose, which can lead to serious complications. A sufferer should monitor their own blood sugar levels continuously to know whether they need a dose of insulin to lower their blood sugar. \n\nThere are different kinds of insulin that can be taken: \n\nRapid-acting insulin and short-acting insulin get insulin into the bloodstream very quickly. They are typically taken before a meal to prepare for the rise in blood sugar that follows eating food. \n\nLong acting insulin provides insulin in the system for up to 24 hours. It is generally taken once a day \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-11-05T21:43:54Z", "text_length": 9421}

Now, the way to take care of cerebral palsy is about making therapies for the body part of a larger purpose of making the person's quality of life better, helping them have choice and make their own decisions about looking after themselves, and helping them be part of society. Much of children's therapy is about helping them walk better. Roughly 60% of people with CP are able to walk by themselves or with mobility aids when they become grown up. \n\nMobility aids may help people with CP move around more easily. \n\n<br />", "timestamp": "2019-04-11T14:34:19Z", "text_length": 2448}

However, humans can spread FMD by carrying the virus on their clothes and body. FMD breaks out all over the globe, because it is highly contagious to many animals. The earliest description of FMD was that by Hieronymi Fracastorii (1546). He described the disease, as being unusual and affecting only cattle, when it occurred in northern Italy in 1514. \n\nWhile the disease is widespread around the world, North America, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Chile, and many countries in Europe are considered free of FMD. Various types of FMD virus have been found in Africa, South America, Asia, and some parts of Europe. \n\nThe most obvious signs of Foot and Mouth Disease are excessive slobbering (letting liquid fall from their mouth), a lack of appetite and lameness (unable to walk properly because of damage to one or both of their legs).

{"title": "Lactose intolerance", "parsed_text": "Lactose intolerance is when a person cannot digest milk or milk products (such as cheese or yogurt). \n\nLactose is a disaccharide sugar (double sugar molecule), which must be split (digested) into two simple sugars (monosaccharides), glucose and galactose. \n\nAn enzyme called lactase is needed to break it down. People with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities. Because of this they are unable to digest lactose. \n\nUp to 75% of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults. This loss of ability ranges from 5% in northern Europe, to over 71% in Sicily and to over 90% in parts of Africa and Asia. There is no cure for lactose intolerance. People need to change their diet to only include food with very little lactose. There are many milk substitutes. \n\nMilk is not a fermented product. If is not digested, then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy. Amino acids are changed to other substances, which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy. \n\nLactose intolerance is not the same as milk allergy, which is an immune reaction to some of the proteins in milk. \n\nNormally infant mammals drink their mother's milk. Then the gene which causes the body to make lactase is switched off, and the young move on to adult food. They can no longer digest milk. \n\nHumans are somewhat different from other mammals. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of genetic polymorphism. \n\nThe ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry. People kept animals which could provide milk. \n\nHunter-gatherer people before the Neolithic revolution were mostly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. \n\nA mutation on chromosome 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production. This makes it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives. \n\nThis appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy products. It occurred in both northern Europe and east Africa in people with a historically pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. \n\nGenetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence have only become common in human populations in the last 10,000 years. Because of this, lactase persistence is often given as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene\u2013culture coevolution. \n\nLactase \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-01-07T02:17:54Z", "text_length": 4338}

After several weeks, or even years later, the joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin sores may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (especially those of the nose) may change shape. After five years or more large areas of skin can die. This leaves large scars. \n\nYaws is spread by touching the fluid from the sores of a person with the disease. The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together. \n\nOther similar diseases are caused by different strains of the same bacterium, such as syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum). Once the lesions have appeared doctors are able to tell it is yaws.

Insulin is a hormone which tells the muscle and fat cells of the body to take up sugar from the blood.

As a result, sugar stays in the blood and is not taken up, leading to a high blood sugar. \n\nThis situation is different from diabetes mellitus type 1. In this case, the islet cells, which make insulin in the pancreas, have been destroyed by the body, and as a result there is no insulin.

It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications. \n\nHypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). \n\nThe brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar.

{"title": "Neuroblastoma", "parsed_text": "Neuroblastoma is a kind of cancer that usually happchens to children and infants. This kind of cancer mostly affects the Autonomic nervous system. The cancer creates tumors, but the cells (pieces) of the tumors do not fully finish growing. There are about 650 cases per year in the United States. About half of these cases occur in children younger than two years old. The tumors can grow from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system.

{"title": "Prostatitis", "parsed_text": "Prostatitis is any form of inflammation of the prostate gland. Because women do not have a prostate gland, it is a condition only found in men, although women do have microscopic paraurethral Skene's glands connected to the distal third of the urethra in the prevaginal space that are homologous to the prostate, and may cause symptoms. \n\nA prostatitis diagnosis is assigned at 8% of all urologist and 1% of all primary care physician visits in the USA. \n\nThe term prostatitis refers in its strictest sense to histological (microscopic) inflammation of the tissue of the prostate gland, although historically the term has loosely been used as a rubric to describe a set of quite different conditions. To try to remedy this, the NIH devised a new classification system in 1999. \n\nAccording to the 1999 National Institute of Health (NIH) Classification, there are four categories of prostatitis: \n\nCategory I: \n\nCategory II: \n\nCategory III: \n\n:: <span style= \" font-size: 85% \"> Subdivisions of IIIa (inflammatory) and IIIb (non-inflammatory) exist based on levels of pus cells in expressed prostatic secretions, but these subcategories are of limited use clinically </span> \n\nCategory IV: \n\nMen with this disease often have chills, fever, pain in the lower back and genital area, urinary frequency and urgency often at night, burning or painful urination, body aches, and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract, as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. There may be discharge from the penis. \n\nAcute prostatitis is relatively easy to diagnose due to its symptoms that suggest infection. Common bacteria are E. Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Serratia, and Staphylococcus aureus. This can be a medical emergency in some patients and hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics may be required. A full blood count reveals increased white blood cells. Sepsis from prostatitis is very rare, but may occur in immunocompromised patients; high fever and malaise generally prompt blood cultures, which are often positive in sepsis. \n\nAntibiotics are the first line of treatment in acute prostatitis (Cat. I). Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short period of time. Appropriate antibiotics should be used, based on the microbe causing the infection. Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule, others, such as Ciprofloxacin, Co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines penetrate well. Severely ill patients may need hospitalization, while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest, analgesics, stool softeners, and hydration. \n\nFull recovery without sequelae is usual. \n\nChronic bacterial prostatitis is a relatively rare condition ( <5% of patients with prostate-related non-BPH LUTS) that usually presents with an intermittent UTI-type picture and that is defined as recurrent urinary tract infections in men originating from a chronic infection in the prostate. Dr. Weidner, Professor of Medicine, Department of Urology, University of Giessen, has stated: \" In studies of 656 men, we seldom found chronic bacterial prostatitis. It is truly a rare disease. Most of those were E-coli. \" Symptoms may be completely absent until there is also bladder infection, and the most troublesome problem is usually recurrent cystitis. \n\nIn chronic bacterial prostatitis there are bacteria in the prostate but usually no symptoms. The prostate infection is diagnosed by culturing urine as well as prostate fluid (expressed prostatic secretions or EPS) which are obtained by the doctor doing a rectal exam and putting pressure on the prostate. If no fluid is recovered after this prostatic massage, a post massage urine should also contain any prostatic bacteria. Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated, although there is no malignancy. \n\nTreatment requires prolonged courses (4\u20138 weeks) of antibiotics that penetrate the prostate well (\u03b2-lactams and nitrofurantoin are ineffective). These include quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), sulfas (Bactrim, Septra) and macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin). Persistent infections may be helped in 80% of patients by the use of alpha blockers (tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin), or long term low dose antibiotic therapy. Recurrent infections may be caused by inefficient urination (benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder), prostatic stones or a structural abnormality that acts as a reservoir for infection. \n\nThe addition of prostate massage to courses of antibiotics was previously proposed as being beneficial. \n\nIt is though not without some risk, and has not been shown in more recent trials to improve outcome compared to antibiotics alone. \n\nOver time, the relapse rate is high, exceeding 50%. \n\nIn chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) there is pelvic pain of unknown cause, lasting longer than 6 months, as the key symptom. Symptoms may wax and wane. Pain can range from mild discomfort to debilitating. Pain may radiate to back and rectum, making sitting difficult. Dysuria, arthralgia, myalgia, unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, constant burning pain in the penis, and frequency may all be present. Frequent urination and increased urgency may suggest interstitial cystitis (inflammation centred in bladder rather than prostate). Ejaculation may be painful, as the prostate contracts during emission of semen, although nerve- and muscle-mediated post-ejaculatory pain is more common, and a classic sign of CP/CPPS. Some patients report low libido, sexual dysfunction and erectile difficulties. Pain after ejaculation is a very specific complaint that distinguishes CP/CPPS from men with BPH or normal men. \n\nTheories behind the disease include autoimmunity, for which there is scant evidence, neurogenic inflammation and myofascial pain syndrome. In the latter two categories, dysregulation of the local nervous system due to past traumatic experiences or an anxious disposition and chronic albeit unconscious pelvic tensing lead to inflammation that is mediated by substances released by nerve cells (such as substance P). The prostate (and other areas of the genitourinary tract: bladder, urethra, testicles) can become inflamed by the action of the chronically activated pelvic nerves on the mast cells at the end of the nerve pathways. Similar stress-induced genitourinary inflammation has been shown experimentally in other mammals. \n\nProstatitis researcher Dr Anthony Schaeffer commented in a 2003 editorial of The Journal of Urology that: \" It is well recognized that even if pathogenic bacteria are present in the prostate, as in men with established chronic bacterial prostatitis, they do not cause chronic pelvic pain unless acute urinary tract infection develops. Taken together, these data suggest that bacteria do not have a significant role in the development of the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The clinical observation that antimicrobial therapy reduces symptomatology in men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome is being tested in a double-blinded NIH controlled study. Since antimicrobials may have anti-inflammatory activity, it is possible that these drugs may benefit the patient by reducing inflammation rather than eradicating bacteria. \" \n\nA year after making that statement, Dr Schaeffer and his colleagues published studies showing that antibiotics are essentially useless for CP/CPPS. \n\nThe bacterial infection theory that for so long had held sway in this field was again shown to be unimportant in another 2003 study from the University of Washington team led by Dr Lee and Professor Richard Berger. The study found that one third of both normal men and patients had equal counts of similar bacteria colonizing their prostates. \n\nSince the publication of these studies, the focus has shifted from infection to neuromuscular and psychological etiologies for chronic prostatitis (CP/CPPS). \n\nPossible role of unculturable bacteria in CPPS: There have been some questions regarding the role of unculturable/ultra-fastidious organisms in prostatitis. Although a team led by Keith Jarvi reported the isolation of unusual bacteria at the American Urological Association's annual meeting in 2001, it was not published in any urology journals, a sign that the paper did not withstand the peer review process. An item about the study was published in Urology Times, a newsletter for urologists. However, subsequent careful PCR studies failed to replicate these findings, and medical researchers are now in general agreement that CPPS is not caused by active bacterial infection. \n\nNon-bacterial prostatitis as a form of interstitial cystitis (IC): Some researchers have suggested that non-bacterial prostatitis is a form of interstitial cystitis. A large multicenter prospective randomized controlled study showed that Elmiron was slightly better than placebo in treating the symptoms of chronic prostatitis. Other therapies shown more effective than Elmiron in treating interstitial cystitis, such as quercetin and Elavil (amitriptyline), can help with chronic prostatitis. \n\nThere are no definitive diagnostic tests for CP/CPPS. This is a poorly understood disorder, even though it accounts for 90%-95% of prostatitis diagnoses. It is found in men of any age, with the peak onset in the early 30s. CP/CPPS may be inflammatory (category IIIa) or non-inflammatory (category IIIb). In the inflammatory form, urine, semen, and other fluids from the prostate contain pus cells (dead white blood cells or WBCs), whereas in the non-inflammatory form no pus cells are present. Recent studies have questioned the distinction between categories IIIa and IIIb, since both categories show evidence of inflammation if pus cells are ignored and other more subtle signs of inflammation, like cytokines, are measured. In 2006, Chinese researchers found that men with categories IIIa and IIIb both had significantly and similarly raised levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF\u00df1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 in their expressed prostatic secretions when compared with controls; therefore measurement of these cytokines could be used to diagnose category III prostatitis. \n\nNormal men have slightly more bacteria in their semen than men with chronic prostatitis/pelvic myoneuropathy. The traditional Stamey 4-glass test is invalid for diagnosis of this disorder, and inflammation cannot be localized to any particular area of the lower GU tract. \n\nMen with CP/CPPS are more likely than the general population to suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated, although there is no malignancy. \n\nExperimental tests that could be useful in the future include tests to measure semen and prostate fluid cytokine levels. Various studies have shown increases in markers for inflammation such as elevated levels of cytokines, myeloperoxidase, and chemokines. \n\nFor chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (Cat III), also known as pelvic myoneuropathy or CP/CPPS, which makes up the majority of men diagnosed with \" prostatitis \" , a treatment called the Stanford Protocol, developed by Stanford University Professor of Urology Rodney Anderson and psychologist David Wise in 1996, has recently been published. This is a combination of medication (using tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychological therapy (paradoxical relaxation, an advancement and adaptation, specifically for pelvic pain, of a type of progressive relaxation technique developed by Edmund Jacobson during the early 20th century), and physical therapy (trigger point release therapy on pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, and also yoga-type exercises with the aim of relaxing pelvic floor and abdominal muscles). While these studies are encouraging, definitive proof of efficacy would require a randomized, sham controlled, blinded study, which is not as easy to do with physical therapy as with drug therapy. \n\nCat. III prostatitis may have no initial trigger other than anxiety, often with an element of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or other anxiety-spectrum problem. This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback (neural wind-up). Current protocols largely focus on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area (commonly referred to as trigger points), physical therapy to the area, and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress. Biofeedback physical therapy to relearn how to control pelvic floor muscles may be useful. \n\nAerobic exercise can help those sufferers who are not also suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or whose symptoms are not exacerbated by exercise. \n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that food allergies and intolerances may have a role in exacerbating CP/CPPS, perhaps through mast cell mediated mechanisms. Specifically patients with gluten intolerance or celiac disease report severe symptom flares after sustained gluten ingestion. Patients may therefore find an exclusion diet helpful in lessening symptoms by identifying problem foods. Studies are lacking in this area. \n\nThere is a substantial list of medications used to treat this disorder. \n\nAlpha blockers (tamsulosin, alfuzosin) are moderately helpful for many men with CPPS; duration of therapy needs to be at least 3 months. \n\nQuercetin has shown effective in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in chronic prostatitis using 500 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. Subsequent studies showed that quercetin, a mast cell inhibitor, reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in the prostate. \n\nPollen extract (Cernilton)] has also been shown effective in randomized placebo controlled trials. \n\nCommonly used therapies that have not been properly evaluated in clinical trials are dietary modification, gabapentin, and amitriptyline. \n\nTherapies shown to be ineffective by randomized placebo/sham controlled trials: levaquin (antibiotics), alpha blockers for 6 weeks or less, transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA). \n\nAt least one study suggests that multi-modal therapy (aimed at different pathways such as inflammation and neuromuscular dysfunction simultaneously) is better long term than monotherapy. \n\nIn recent years the prognosis for CP/CPPS has improved greatly with the advent of multimodal treatment, phytotherapy and protocols aimed at quieting the pelvic nerves through myofascial trigger point release and anxiety control. \n\nThese patients have no history of genitourinary pain complaints, but leukocytosis or bacteria have been noted during evaluation for other conditions. \n\nDiagnosis is through tests of semen, EPS or urine that reveal inflammation in the absence of symptoms. \n\nNo treatment required. It is standard practice for men with infertility and category IV prostatitis to be given a trial of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatories however evidence for efficacy are weak. Since signs of asymptomatic prostatic inflammation may sometimes be associated with prostate cancer, this can be addressed by tests that assess the ratio of free-to-total PSA. The results of these tests were significantly different in prostate cancer and category IV prostatitis in one study. \n\n<div class= \" references-small \"> \n\nNickel J.C., Moon T., \" Chronic bacterial prostatitis: an evolving clinical enigma \" , Urology 66:1:2-8 (July 2005). \n\nShoskes D.A., \" Use of antibiotics in chronic prostatitis syndromes \" , Can.

{"title": "Hemorrhoid", "parsed_text": "Hemorrhoid or haemorrhoid (also commonly called piles) are vascular structures (similar to veins) in the anal canal which help with stool evacuation. We only speak of hemorrhoids (or piles) when they become swollen or inflamed. But Hemorrhoids are a normal part of the anatomy and everyone has these structures. They act as a cushion that is made of complex tissue. Their job is to aid the passage of stool. Hemorrhoids are very common. Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. \n\nIt is not known what causes hemorrhoids, but doctors often speak of several main factors. These factors include chronic\u00a0constipation\u00a0or diarrhea, sitting on the\u00a0toilet\u00a0for a long time and straining during defecation. Hemorrhoids may also appear because of sports. When something heavy is lifted, additional pressure is applied on the area. Women are in danger of having hemorrhoids during pregnancy. This also happens due to increased pressure from the baby. Hemorrhoids are more likely with aging because the tissue becomes weaker. Some people are more likely to get hemorrhoids if other family members have them. \n\nAccording to their anatomical origin hemorrhoids can be two types - internal and external. Internal hemorrhoids originate from inside the anus. But internal hemorrhoids can also go down and show outside the anus. In this case, medical professionals are talking about prolapse. \n\nSymptoms of internal hemorrhoids include\u00a0itching, bleeding, swelling, mucus discharge, burning sensation, prolapse, and soiling. Patients also complain of general discomfort while sitting, feeling of fullness and presence of a foreign body inside the anus. Internal hemorrhoids can only cause painless bleeding from the anus, while external hemorrhoids are painful. External hemorrhoids are located on the outside of the anus. They look like a bluish lump. But sometimes internal hemorrhoids can also become extremely painful. This happens because they develop a clot. In these cases, a thrombosed hemorrhoid occurs and it may have to be operated. Pain in the area around the anus may be due to another disease, such as anal fissure, anal fistula, or proctitis. \n\nHemorrhoids are diagnosed by a doctor.\u00a0A visual examination of the anus is usually needed. The doctor may want to perform a rectal examination which will help detect internal hemorrhoids, tumours, polyps, or abscesses. The visual examination usually requires a special device, called anoscope to be inserted in the anus. The procedure is painless unless another disease is presented. \n\nTreatment of hemorrhoids can be done at home or in the hospital. Usually, the best option is to prevent getting them. This can be done by keeping the stools soft and bulk, so they pass easily during defecation. Stools can be made softer and larger by increasing fiber intake. This means eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Most people do not have enough fiber in their diet. In such case, fiber supplements, such as psyllium or methylcellulose, can be of benefit. \n\nIt is also important to increase fluids intake and maintain hydration. It is recommended to drink six to eight glasses of water a day to help keep stools soft. \n\nHome treatment may include sitz baths,\u00a0topical creams, and\u00a0suppositories.\u00a0There are many types available for the treatment of hemorrhoids, but there is little evidence supporting their use. \n\nSmall lifestyle modifications are important when dealing with hemorrhoids. Not straining during defecation and going as soon as the urge appears are important measures. Staying active can help prevent constipation and reduce weight. \n\nSometimes hemorrhoids can not be treated at home or the patient seeks help. Doctors can treat hemorrhoids with office procedures or in a hospital setting. \n\nOffice treatments include: \n\nRubber band ligation - Rubber band ligation is a simple procedure. The doctor uses a special device to place a rubber band around the hemorrhoid. The band cuts off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid. The hemorrhoid will then fall within a week. Scar tissue then forms to keep the remaining tissue fixated. This procedure is usually painless, because there are no nerve endings where the rubber band is placed. The patient should seek medical assistance if extreme pain is felt. This might be due to thrombosis. \n\nSclerotherapy - the procedures\u00a0involves an injection into the internal hemorrhoid. The injection contains special solution which causes scar tissue to form and shrink the hemorrhoid. \n\nInfrared photocoagulation -\u00a0In this procedure infrared light is applied at the internal hemorrhoid. The infrared light causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid. \n\nElectrocoagulation.\u00a0A special device is used to apply electric current onto the internal hemorrhoid. The procedure causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid. \n\nIn severe cases when home and office procedures fail, a surgical approach can be considered. There are several surgical techniques used. All of them are associated with different complications, such as bleeding, infection (sepsis), anal strictures, fecal incontinence, etc. Some of the procedures involve hemorrhoid removal. These procedures are commonly known as Hemorrhoidectomy. There are several variants, but in all of them, the surgeon will remove the hemorrhoids. The procedure can be performed to remove external and large prolapsing internal hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidectomy is infamous for being very painfu. l This is due to specific location, where the procedure is performed. The anal canal contains many nerves, which can easily be traumatized. \n\nOther surgical procedures include - stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PPH, Longo's procedure) and doppler-guided artery ligation\u00a0(DG-HAL/RAR or THD). \n\nStapled hemorrhoidopexy involves a special device, called stapler, which lifts and fixates the prolapsed hemorrhoids. The stapler will also excise mucosal tissue to block the blood flow to the remaining hemorrhoids. However, stapling procedure is associated with a greater risk of recurrence. \n\nDoppler-guided ligation of hemorrhoidal arteries (DG-HAL/RAR or THD) has been recently purposed as a safe and relatively painless alternative to hemorrhoidectomy. A special ultrasound device is applied to identify the arteries that supply the hemorrhoids. The surgeon will then will the ligate them, cutting the blood supply and preventing further problems. However, the procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate. \n\nHemorrhoidolysis, a treatment for hemorrhoids \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-10-15T04:07:52Z", "text_length": 7296}
{"title": "Glaucoma", "parsed_text": "Glaucoma is a disease that causes damage to the eye. If a person who has glaucoma does not get help from a doctor, they will not be able to see. \n\nThis disease happens because of increased pressure in the eye.

The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them attention (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of importance. Some risk factors are heredity, child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent. Anti-psychotic therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic. A high proportion of people who have CD also have other mental disorders, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes the affects of CD worse.", "timestamp": "2015-09-21T17:37:10Z", "text_length": 953}
{"title": "Skin cancer", "parsed_text": "Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin. In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive. \n\nSkin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious \u2014 for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15\u201334 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds. \n\nNon-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time.

About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals. \n\nZoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways. They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human - for example, through bites and infected saliva (like with rabies), or through the air. This is called direct zoonosis. \n\nZoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector. This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected. Diseases like this are called vector-borne diseases. \n\nSometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal. For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans. Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick. Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague. The rat is the host of the disease, and the flea is the vector. \n\nMany foodborne illnesses are zoonotic diseases. In these cases, a human gets sick from eating food that came from a sick animal. \n\nThe most common pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses are Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.

It is usually an infection of the urinary system and genitals. \n\nThe Trichomonas vaginalis parasite can only live in the human genital tract. Trichomoniasis is only spread through sex, or if two people's genitals touch. \n\nMost people with trichomoniasis do not have any symptoms. \n\nWhen people do have symptoms, they usually start about 5 to 28 days after the person got infected. Symptoms may include: \n\nPain, burning, or itching in the urethra (urethritis), the vagina (vaginitis), or the penis \n\nPain while having sex (dyspareunia) \n\nWomen may have a yellow-green, badly-smelling vaginal discharge \n\nLower abdominal pain (this does not happen often) \n\nComplications are serious problems that can happen because a person has a disease. These problems do not happen to everyone with trichomoniasis. They are the most serious problems that trichomoniasis can cause. Some of the most dangerous problems that can happen to a person with trichomoniasis include: \n\nPeople with trichomoniasis are more likely to get (or spread) HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nIf a woman is pregnant, trichomoniasis can cause her to have a premature infant, or an infant that weighs less than normal. \n\nTrichomoniasis may work together with human papillomavirus (HPV) to cause cervical cancer, although this has not been proven. \n\nIn men, trichomoniasis can cause inflammation (swelling) of the urethra and the prostate. In the prostate, trichomoniasis may create chronic (long-term) inflammation that may eventually cause prostate cancer. \n\nTreatment for trichomoniasis is usually metronidazole (Flagyl), which kills protozoa like Trichomonas vaginalis. However, this medication has to be used carefully with woman who are in the early stages of pregnancy. Anyone the infected person has had sex with should also get treatment, even if they have no symptoms. \n\nAbout 95% to 97% of people with trichomoniasis are cured after one dose of metronidazole. \n\nWithout treatment, trichomoniasis can stay in a woman's body for months to years. In many (but not all) men, it seems to go away on its own. \n\nTrichomoniasis can be prevented by having safe sex (for example, by using condoms). \n\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that women who are having vaginal discharge should get tested for trichomoniasis. \n\nTrichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world that is not caused by a virus.

About 5-10% of chronic (long-term) alcoholics get the DTs at some point in their life. \n\nDTs cause symptoms that can be very bad and very dangerous. Even though not many people get DTs when they stop drinking, many people that do get DTs die from them. Others get permanent brain damage or other problems. \n\nSymptoms usually start within 2 to 3 days after the person had their last drink. But in some people, DTs can happen up to a week or 10 days after their last drink. \n\nMost people who die from DTs die from one or more of these symptoms: \n\nVery bad seizures, especially status epilepticus \n\nHyperthermia (a very high body temperature; if the body's temperature gets high enough, the brain will die) \n\nSevere hypertension (very high blood pressure; if the blood pressure gets high enough, it can cause a stroke) \n\nSevere tachycardia (very high heart rate; if the heart beats too fast, it cannot get blood and oxygen to the rest of the body. Without enough blood and oxygen, no part of the body can survive. Eventually breathing can stop. The brain can die or be damaged. The heart can stop beating normally or stop beating completely.) \n\nOther body symptoms caused by DTs include: \n\nVery bad sweating \n\nShaking or tremor <nowiki/> s (which may be uncontrollable) \n\nInsomnia (being unable to sleep) \n\nFeeling very restless \n\nDTs can cause changes to thinking and feelings that can be very scary for the patient: \n\nVery bad anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, or agitation (feeling very upset and unable to relax) \n\nThe person may be so anxious or upset that they are certain they are going to die \n\nBeing very confused (for example, the person might not recognize their family members) \n\nBeing disoriented (for example, the person may not know who he is, where he is, or what is happening) \n\nBeing unable to think normally or pay attention to anything \n\nBeing unable to talk normally \n\nDTs can cause major changes to the senses, especially what a person sees, hears, and feels. For example: \n\nVisual hallucinations: seeing things that are not really there. These things seem very real to the person with DTs. For example, sometimes people with DTs see very scary visions of insects, snakes, or rats. \n\nThese visions often go along with the feeling that things like bugs are crawling on the person with DTs. \n\nAuditory hallucinations: hearing things that are not really there. \n\nDTs always need to be treated in a hospital. If a person starts having symptoms of DTs at home, 9-1-1 (or their local emergency number) should be called for an ambulance right away. \n\nSeveral types of medicines can be used to treat DTs: \n\nBenzodiazepines are the most common type of medicine used for DTs. In the United Kingdom, chlordiazepoxide\u00a0(Librium) and\u00a0diazepam (Valium) are most often used. In the United States, lorazepam (Ativan) and oxazepam are often used too. These medicines will keep the person asleep or relaxed, make them more comfortable, and help prevent seizures. \n\nSometimes anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medicines are also used to prevent or treat seizures. \n\nAntipsychotic medicines, like haloperidol (Haldol), may be used to help make hallucinations go away. \n\nPeople with DTs are also often given thiamine (vitamin B1), an important vitamin, because alcoholics often do not have enough thiamine.

{"title": "Diabetic ketoacidosis", "parsed_text": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency that can happen in people with diabetes mellitus. DKA happens mostly in people with Type 1 diabetes, although it may happen in some people that have Type 2 diabetes. \n\nDKA happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body. All of the cells in the body need glucose (sugar) to survive, because the body needs sugar to make energy. Insulin breaks down glucose into a form that the body can use for energy. Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood and cannot get into the cells. This causes high blood sugar levels and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy. \n\nDKA can be caused by not having enough insulin, eating too many carbohydrates, and sometimes physical or mental stress. DKA can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered, or is not being controlled well. \n\nDKA is diagnosed through blood and urine testing. These tests will show high blood sugar, which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis. \n\nDKA was first discovered around 1886. Before insulin therapy was first used in the 1920s, DKA almost always caused death. \n\nSymptoms of DKA include: \n\nNausea and vomiting \n\ndehydration \n\nThe \" 3 polys \" of DKA: \n\nPolydipsia (feeling very thirsty; this is caused by dehydration) \n\nPolyphagia (feeling very hungry; the brain realizes the body's cells are not getting enough sugar and triggers hunger, because normally eating would give the cells the sugar they need) \n\nPolyuria (urinating a lot; this is the body's way of trying to get rid of the extra glucose in the bloodstream) \n\nA \" fruity \" smell on the breath (acetone breath, caused by the body trying to blow off the acids and waste products created by DKA) \n\nAbdominal pain \n\nAs DKA gets worse, it can cause these symptoms: \n\nConfusion, which becomes worse and worse (because the brain is not getting enough sugar to work properly) \n\nLethargy (feeling very tired), because the body is not able to make enough energy \n\nEventually, the person will go into a coma because the brain does not have enough sugar to stay awake \n\nKussmaul respirations (breathing that is deep, gasping, and difficult), because the body is trying to blow off extra acids \n\nWithout proper treatment, DKA can cause death. \n\nFirst, because there is not enough insulin to bring glucose into the cells, glucose builds up in the blood. This causes there to be too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells. The cells start starving, because they do not have insulin to break down glucose into a form that the cells can use for energy. \n\nTo try to create energy for the cells, the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and ketones. These create a little bit of energy, but they are also acidic. The blood starts to get too acidic, and the body starts to get poisoned. \n\nBecause the cells still do not have enough glucose to create the energy they need, the liver also breaks down glycogen to make more glucose. (The body stores sugar in different forms in case it needs energy later. Glucagon helps break down some of these sugar stores into glucose.) However, there is still not enough insulin in the blood to break down the glucose into energy. Because of this, the glucose stays in the blood (making the blood sugar levels get even higher) and the cells keep starving. \n\nNext, the body begins to break down protein. (When the body cannot create enough energy by breaking down fat and glycogen into sugar, it breaks down protein.) This causes the tissues in the body to lose nitrogen. \n\nNow there is much more glucose in the bloodstream than in the cells. The body always tries to stay in homeostasis. In homeostasis, there would be an equal amount of sugar in the bloodstream and the cells. To try to make this happen, the cells (which have very little sugar in them) give up water to the blood (which is very sugary). The goal is to try to dilute the sugar in the blood, and decrease the high levels of hyperglycemia. If the cells give up too much water, they can get dehydrated (not have enough fluid left in them). Because DKA also causes a person to urinate often, a person with DKA can get dehydrated very quickly. This dehydration can be a medical emergency. \n\nThe kidneys try to filter out the extra glucose in the bloodstream. This causes glucosuria (too much sugar in the urine). The extra glucose going through the kidneys causes more urine to be created. When a person urinates more, they lose more electrolytes, like sodium and potassium. Without enough electrolytes, the heart, muscles, and nerve cells cannot work properly. Also, eventually, the kidneys can fail because they are overworked by the amount of glucose they are trying to filter. \n\nPeople with DKA need to be treated in a hospital. Usually, treatment involves: \n\nGiving insulin. Insulin reverses all of the changes in the body that cause DKA. It brings sugar out of the bloodstream and into the cells. Once the cells have enough insulin, they can break down glucose to get energy. \n\nGiving fluids. Because people with DKA can get so dehydrated, they are usually given fluids.

{"title": "Sick building syndrome", "parsed_text": "Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a combination of illnesses (a syndrome) associated with a human's place of work (office building) or dwelling. A 1984 World Health Organization report into suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of SBS. Most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality. \n\nSBS can be caused by flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), molds (see mold health issues), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (byproduct of some office machinery), using light industrial chemicals in the building, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value). \n\nPeople try to fix SBS symptoms by increasing the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange between the building's air and the outside air. But the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the SBS sources in the first place. Cleaners should lower their use of dangerous VOC cleaning compounds, and get rid of conditions that cause allergenic, potentially-deadly mold growth. \n\nBuilding occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose, throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; and odor and taste sensations. \n\nSeveral sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected. The key to discovery SBS is if a number of people first experience their illnesses within a period of weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone. However, there can be lasting effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. Sensitive individuals can have long-term health effects. \n\nThe following steps can avoid SBS: \n\nCleaning roof shingles for non-pressure removal of algae, mold & Gloeocapsa magma. \n\nPollutant source removal or modification to storage of sources. \n\nReplacement of water-stained ceiling tiles and carpeting. \n\nUse paints, adhesives, solvents, and pesticides in well-ventilated areas, and use of these pollutant sources only during periods of non-occupancy. \n\nIncrease the number of air exchanges, The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers recommend a minimum of 8.4 air exchanges per 24 hour period. \n\nProper and frequent maintenance of HVAC systems \n\nInstalling a UV-C light in the HVAC plenum \n\nRegular vacuuming with a HEPA filter vacuum cleaner to collect and retain 99.97% of particles down to and including 0.3 micrometres. \n\nThere might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men. Along with this, some studies found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors, because they have a tendency to have more clerical work where they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines), while men may more often have jobs based outside of offices. \n\nAerotoxic syndrome \n\nMart\u00edn-Gil J, Yanguas MC, San Jos\u00e9 JF, Rey-Mart\u00ednez and Mart\u00edn-Gil FJ. \" Outcomes of research into a sick hospital \" .

{"title": "Multiple sclerosis", "parsed_text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body\u2019s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system. The disease has different effects in different people, and can make people\u2019s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people. \n\nIn healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work. Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. A person with MS has myelin that is too thin or completely gone. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do. \n\nScientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS: \n\nA person\u2019s genetics (the qualities they are born with) \n\nToo few vitamins in the body \n\nToo much stress in a person\u2019s life \n\nSmoking cigars or cigarettes \n\nBeing ill many times as a child \n\nResearch about the causes of MS is still incomplete. Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS. Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease. \n\nQuite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness. The disease damages myelin. Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin. When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time. This is called remission. When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse. The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS. In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called \" Primary Progressive MS \" . Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously. \n\nPeople with MS have many problems. Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing. People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily. Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor. Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people. \n\nInside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment. The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin. The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells. When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time. Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has. \n\nInflammation is an important part of MS symptoms. Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body. It is the first part of an immune system response. In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system. Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae. \n\nThe people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too. MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator. Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances. \n\nTo diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur. The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis. A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient. A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin. Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are. Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons. \n\nOnce a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms. Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely. The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms. Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over. Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often. These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead. Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective. \n\nMultiple sclerosis -Citizendium", "timestamp": "2020-03-07T16:28:01Z", "text_length": 7424}

For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect. \n\nToxicity is species-specific. A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another. \n\nAcute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure, or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be known as acute toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something. \n\nAcute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years). \n\nIt is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents).

{"title": "Bone fracture", "parsed_text": "Bone fractures happen when a bone is damaged by stress. The bone can be fractured in many different ways. \n\nMost human bones are strong and do not break when hit by strong impacts or forces. However, if that force is too powerful, or there is something wrong with the bone, it can fracture. \n\nThere are many different types of bone fractures. Fractures are often separated into categories. \n\nIn an open fracture (also called a compound fracture), the broken bone breaks through the skin. This can cause infection, since the skin usually protects the body from germs. If the skin is broken, germs can get into the body. Open fractures can also damage muscles, tendons and ligaments if the sharp ends of the broken bone go through them. \n\nIn a closed fracture, the broken bone does not break through the skin. \n\nIn a simple fracture, the broken bone is the only thing that is damaged. \n\nIn a complex fracture, the sharp ends of the broken bone damage the soft tissue around the bone. \n\nThis is the type of injury in which the broken bone has passed through the skin, forming some wounds. That is why it is also called an open fracture or composite fracture. Compared to the simple fracture , the open wound has made it even more dangerous since the person suffering from it is exposed to infection. Therefore, an operation may be necessary to prevent the wound from becoming infected. \n\nIn a complete fracture, the bone is broken all the way through. The broken bone is in two separate pieces. \n\nIn an incomplete fracture, the bone is not broken all the way through. The bone is partly broken, but it is still in one piece. There are a few kinds of incomplete fractures, including: \n\nHairline fracture: Only the outer layer of the bone is broken. This is also called a fissure fracture. \n\nGreenstick fracture: These fractures usually happen only in children, because their bones are more flexible than adults'. In a greenstick fracture, only one side of the bone is broken. The bone is usually \" bent, \" and is broken only on the outside of the bend. \n\nIn a comminuted fracture, at least three pieces of a bone have broken off. This means the bone is in four separate pieces or more (the main bone, plus the three or more pieces that have broken off). \n\nSometimes people have multiple fractures. This can mean two different things: \n\nOne bone is broken in two different places, or more; or \n\nOne person has fractures in many different bones, all caused by the same injury (like being hit by a car). \n\nOn average, it usually takes 6-8 weeks for a fracture to heal. . However, healing times depend on many different things, like which bones were broken, how bad the breaks were, age (younger people usually heal faster), and nutrition. \n\nMost fractures are diagnosed by using an X-ray. If the X-ray cannot see the fracture, other scans, like MRIs and CT scans, can show that a fracture exists. \n\nThe best way to \" fix \" a bone fracture is to make sure the ends of the broken bone are lined up and tight together. As the American Academy on Orthopedic Surgeons says: \n\n<blockquote> \" All forms of treatment of broken bones follow one basic rule: the broken pieces must be put back into position and prevented from moving out of place until they are healed.... Broken bone ends heal by \" knitting \" back together with new bone being formed around the edge of the broken parts. \" </blockquote> \n\nTo help decrease pain from the fracture, doctors can prescribe medications or suggest over-the-counter painkillers. \n\nScientists have come up with a few ways to \" regenerate bone \" (make the bone grow again). Their many ideas for future strategies include doing gene therapy and using 3-D printers. \n\nSee illustrations with Simple English explanations of each of the types of fractures (from Brigham & Women's Hospital) \n\nSimple English materials on broken bones for children and for teenagers (from KidsHealth.org) \n\n\" Patient-Friendly Bone Basics \" about preventing osteoporosis and bone breaks (from the National Osteoporosis Foundation) \n\n\" Classification Of Fracture - Simple And Composite Fracture \" First Aid Steps For A Broken Bone(fracturesandbonehealing.blogspot.com) - Simple Bone Fracture Healing Time.", "timestamp": "2020-02-19T14:34:10Z", "text_length": 4972}

The term \" cyclopia \" comes from Cyclops, a giant one-eyed creature the Greek Greek mythology. \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-08-30T23:50:07Z", "text_length": 502}

{"title": "Streptococcal pharyngitis", "parsed_text": "Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is an illness that is caused by the bacteria called \u201cGroup A Streptococcus\u201d. Strep throat affects the throat and the tonsils. The tonsils are the two glands in the throat at the back of the mouth. Strep throat can also affect the voice box (larynx). Common symptoms include fever, throat pain (also called a sore throat), and swollen glands (called lymph nodes) in the neck. Strep throat causes 37% of sore throats among children. \n\nStrep throat spreads through close contact with a sick person. To be sure that a person has strep throat, a test called a throat culture is needed. Even without this test, a likely case of strep throat can be known because of the symptoms. Antibiotics can help a person with strep throat. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They are used mostly to prevent complication such as rheumatic fever rather than to shorten the length of sickness. \n\nThe usual symptoms of strep throat are a sore throat, fever of more than 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), pus (a yellow or green fluid made up of dead bacteria, and white blood cells) on the tonsils, and swollen lymph nodes. \n\nThere can be other symptoms such as: \n\nHead pain (headache) \n\nVomiting or the urge to vomit (nausea) \n\nStomach pain \n\nFlatulence \n\nMuscle pain \n\nRash (small red bumps) on the body or in the mouth or throat. This is an unusual but a specific sign. \n\nA person who gets strep throat will show symptoms one to three days after coming in contact with a sick person. \n\n<gallery> \n\nFile:StrepAug2010.JPG|A case of strep throat.

Note the large tonsils in the back of the throat, covered in white pus. \n\n</gallery> \n\nStrep throat is caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS). Other bacteria or viruses can also cause a sore throat. People get strep throat by direct, close contact with a sick person. The illness can spread more easily when people are crowded together. Examples of crowding include people in the military or in schools. The GAS bacteria can dry out into dust, but then it cannot make people sick. If bacteria in the environment are keep moist they can make people sick for up to 15 days. Moist bacteria can be found on things like toothbrushes. These bacteria can live in food, but this is very unusual. People who eat the food can become sick. Twelve percent of children with no symptoms of strep throat have GAS in their throats normally. \n\n+ Modified Centor score \n\nPointsProbability of StrepTreatment \n\n1 or less <10%No antibiotic or culture needed \n\n2 11\u201317%Antibiotic based on culture or RADT \n\n3 28\u201335% \n\n4 or 5 52%Antibiotics without doing a culture \n\nA checklist called the modified Centor score helps doctors decide how to care for people with sore throats. The Centor score has five clinical measurements or observations. It shows how likely it is that someone has strep throat. \n\nOne point is given for each of these criteria: \n\nNo cough \n\nSwollen lymph nodes or lymph nodes that hurt if they are touched \n\nTemperature greater than 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) \n\nPus or swelling of the tonsils \n\nUnder the age of 15 years (a point is taken away if the person is older than 44 years) \n\nA test called a throat culture is the main way to know if a person has strep throat. This test is correct 90 to 95 percent of the time. There is another test called a rapid strep test, or RADT. The rapid strep test is faster than a throat culture but correctly finds the illness only 70 percent of the time. Both tests can show when a person does not have strep throat. They can show this correctly 98 percent of the time. \n\nWhen a person is sick a throat culture or rapid strep test can tell if the person is sick from strep throat. People who have no symptoms should not be tested with a throat culture or rapid strep test as some people have streptococcal bacteria in their throats normally without any bad results. And these people do not need treatment. \n\nStrep throat has some of the same symptoms as other illnesses. Because of this, it can be hard to know if a person has strep throat without a throat culture or rapid strep test. If the person has fever and sore throat with coughing, a runny nose, diarrhea, and red itchy feeling eyes, it is more likely to be a sore throat that is caused by a virus. Infectious mononucleosis can cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck and a sore throat, fever, and it can make the tonsils get bigger. This diagnosis can be determined by a blood test. There is however no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis. \n\nSome people get strep throat more often than others. Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat. Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils. Waiting is also appropriate. \n\nStrep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment. Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker. The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness. For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms. \n\nMedicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat. These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen. Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine. Aspirin may be used in adults. It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome. \n\nPenicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat. It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money. Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe. In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever. Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment. The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms. The average length is three to five days. Antibiotics lowers this by about one day. These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness. The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications. These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections. The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects. Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication. Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads. The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin. Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies. Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis). Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition. \n\nThe symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses. They also make it harder to spread the illness. Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics. \n\nThese very bad problems might be caused by strep throat: \n\nThese include rheumatic fever or scarlet fever \n\nA deadly illness called toxic shock syndrome \n\nGlomerulonephritis \n\nAn illness called PANDAS syndrome. This is an immune problem that causes sudden, sometimes serious behavioral problems. \n\nStrep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis. About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year. Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses. The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children. It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults. Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-04-13T15:31:33Z", "text_length": 10184}
{"title": "Urinary tract infection", "parsed_text": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection caused by bacteria in part of the urinary tract. In the lower urinary tract, it is known as a simple cystitis (a bladder infection). In the upper urinary tract, it is known as pyelonephritis (a kidney infection). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include painful peeing and either frequent peeing or wanting to pee (or both). Symptoms of a kidney infection also include fever and side and back pain. In old people and young children, the symptoms are not always as clear. The main cause for both types is the bacteria Escherichia coli. Other bacteria, viruses, or fungus may be the cause in rare cases. \n\nWomen get urinary tract infections more often than men. Half of women have an infection at some point in their lives. It is common to have repeated infections. Risk factors include sexual intercourse as well as family history. Sometimes a person who had a bladder infection will get a kidney infection. Kidney infection also can be caused by bacteria in the blood. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. Sometimes, the urine needs to be tested. A person with frequent infections can take low-dose antibiotics to prevent future infections. \n\nAntibiotics are used to treat simple cases of urinary tract infections. resistance to many of the antibiotics used to treat this condition, however, is increasing. People who have complicated urinary tract infections sometimes have to take antibiotics for a longer time, or might take antibiotics intravenously (through the veins). If symptoms have not improved in two or three days, a person will need further tests. In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection. Ten percent of women develop urinary tract infections yearly. \n\nLower urinary tract infection is also known as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with peeing and having to pee frequently (or wanting to pee) without vaginal discharge or significant pain. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In healthy women, the symptoms last an average of six days. Some people will have pain above the pubic bone (lower abdomen) or in the lower back. People who have an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis (a kidney infection), can have flank pain, fever (a high temperature), or nausea and vomiting. Those symptoms are in addition to the normal symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. In rare cases the urine looks bloody or contains visible pyuria (pus in the urine). \n\nIn young children, fever can be the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Many medical associations recommend a urine culture for females younger than two year old or uncircumcised males who are younger than a year and have a fever. Infants with UTI sometimes eat poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of jaundice ( a yellow coloring of the skin). Older children can have new urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control). \n\nUrinary tract symptoms are frequently not seen in those who are old. Sometimes, the only symptoms are incontinence (loss of bladder control), a change in mental status (ability to think), or feeling tired. The first symptom for some old people is sepsis, an infection of the blood. Diagnosis can be difficult because many old people are incontinent (cannot hold their pee) or have dementia (poor thinking abilities). \n\nE. coli is the cause of 80\u201385% of urinary tract infections. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the cause in 5\u201310% of cases. In rare cases, viral or fungal infections cause urinary tract infections Other bacterial causes of UTI include: \n\nKlebsiella \n\nProteus \n\nPseudomonas, \n\nEnterobacter \n\nThese bacterial causes are not common and usually happen when the person has an abnormal urinary system or the person has a urinary catheterization (tube inserted into the bladder. Urinary tract infections due toStaphylococcus aureus usually happens after the person has had a blood infection. \n\nSexual intercourse is the cause of 75\u201390% of bladder infections in young, sexually active women. The risk of infection is related to how often they have sex. With UTIs so frequent when women first get married, the term \" honeymoon cystitis \" is often used. In post-menopausal women (women who have stopped menstruating), sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI. Using spermicide (a gel or cream to kill sperm) increases the risk of UTIs. \n\nWomen get more UTIs than men because women have a urethra that is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's estrogen (a hormone) levels decrease with menopause, the risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora (good bacterial that live in the vagina). \n\nA urinary catheter is a tube that is put into the bladder to drain the urine. Using a catheter increases the risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is 3% - 6% every day the catheter is used. Antibiotics do not stop these infections. The risk of an infection can be decreased by: \n\nusing a catheter only when necessary \n\nmaking sure everything is very clean (sterile) when putting the catheter in \n\nmaking sure that nothing blocks the catheter. \n\nBladder infections are more common in some families. Other risk factors include diabetes, being circumcised, and having a large prostate (a gland around the urethra in males). Complicating factors are not completely clear. These factors may include some anatomic problems (relating to physical narrowing), functional, or metabolic problems. A complicated UTI is more difficult to treat and usually needs more aggressive evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. In children, UTIs are linked to vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation. \n\nThe bacteria that cause urinary tract infections usually go into the bladder from the uretha. It is believed these bacteria come from the bowel. Females are at greater risk because they have a short urethra that is close to their anus). After entering the bladder, E. Coli are able to stick to the bladder wall. They form a biofilm, which is a coating of microorganisms, that resists the body's immune response. However, infections can also come through the blood or lymph. \n\nThe following activities do not cause a UTI or make them happen less frequently: \n\nusing birth-control pills or condoms \n\npeeing immediately after sex \n\nthe type of underwear worn \n\npersonal cleaning methods used after peeing or defecating \n\nwhether a person usually bathes or showers. \n\nholding onto urine and not peeing \n\ntampon use \n\ndouching \n\nPeople who often get UTIs and who use spermicide or a diaphragm for birth control should use a different type of birth control. Cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of infections, but some people cannot use cranberries for long periods of time. Gastrointestinal (stomach) upset occurs in more than 30% of people who regularly drink cranberry juice or take capsules. As of 2011, probiotics used intravaginally (in the vagina) require further study to determine if they are helpful. \n\nFor people who keep getting infections, taking antibiotics for a long time is helpful. Drugs frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. If infections are related to sexual intercourse, some women find it useful to taking antibiotics after sex. In post-menopausal women, using topical vaginal estrogen (a hormone applied to the skin of the vaginal) has been found to reduce getting a UTI. Unlike topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries (medical devices put in the vagina is not as useful as low-dose antibiotics. A number of vaccines are being developed (as of 2011). \n\nThere is little evidence that using preventative antibiotics decreases urinary tract infections in children. It is rare for people who have no problems with their kidneys to develop kidney problems from frequent UTIs. Having frequent urinary tract infections as a child causes less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults. \n\nIn most cases, UTIs can be diagnosed just from the symptoms and there is no need for laboratory testing. Urinalysis (testing the urine) can be used to confirm the diagnosis in complicated cases. The urine is tested for urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. Another test, urine microscopy, looks for red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is considered positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10 <sup> 3 </sup> colony-forming units per mL of a typical bacteria that causes infections of the urinary tract. Cultures can also be used to test which antibiotic will work. However, women with negative cultures can still improve with antibiotic treatment. UTI symptoms in old people can be vague, and diagnosis can be difficult as there is no really reliable test. \n\nA urinary tract infection in the lower urinary tract is known as a bladder infection. A UTI in the upper urinary tract is known as pyelonephritis or kidney infection. If the urine has significant bacteria, but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. \n\nA urinary tract infection is said to be complicated if: \n\nit is in the upper tract \n\nthe person has diabetes mellitus \n\nthe person is pregnant \n\nthe person is male \n\nthe person has a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) because of another illness. \n\nOtherwise if a women is a healthy and before menopause, the infection is said to be uncomplicated. When children also have a fever, the urinary tract infection is considered to be an upper urinary tract infection. \n\nTo diagnose a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required. Contamination poses a frequent challenge so a cutoff of 10 <sup> 5 </sup> CFU/mL is used for a \" clean-catch \" mid-stream sample, 10 <sup> 4 </sup> CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10 <sup> 2 </sup> CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder through the stomach wall with a needle). The World Health Organization does not like the use of \u201curine bags\u201d to collect samples because there is a high rate of contamination when that urine is cultured. Catheterization is preferred if an individual is unable to use a toilet. Some medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time X-rays while they urinate) in all children who are younger than 2 years old and have had a urinary tract infection. Other medical groups such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend routine imaging only in babies younger than 6 months old or who have unusual findings. \n\nIn women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) can be the cause for people who have UTI symptoms many times, but whose urine cultures remain negative and do not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis. \n\nPhenazopyridine can be used in addition to antibiotics to help ease the burning pain of a bladder infection. However, phenazopyridine is no longer commonly recommended due to safety concerns. It can cause methemoglobinemia, which means there is higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood. Acetaminophen can be used for fevers. \n\nWomen who keep getting simple UTIs can benefit from self-treatment; these women should get medical treatment medical only if the initial treatment fails. Health care providers may also prescribe the antibiotics by phone. \n\nSimple infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone. Oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, or a fluoroquinolone will shorten the time to recovery. All these drugs are equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually enough. Nitrofurantoin needs 5\u20137 days. With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36 hours. About 50% of people will get better without treatment within a few days or weeks. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend fluoroquinolones as first treatment because of concerns that overuse will lead to resistance to this class of drugs, making these drugs less effective for more serious infections. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these drugs because to their widespread use. In some countries, trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX. Children with simple UTIs are often helped by a three-day course of antibiotics. \n\nPyelonephritis (kidney infection) is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in geographic areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone often is prescribed. People with more severe symptoms are sometimes admitted a hospital for ongoing antibiotics. If symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment, it can mean that the urinary tract is blocked by a kidney stone. \n\nUrinary tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 years. Ten percent of women get an infection yearly; 60% have an infection at some point in their lives. Nearly half of people get a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) occurs between 20\u201330 times less frequently than bladder infections. Pyelonephritis is the most common cause of hospital acquired infections, accounting for approximately 40% of hospital-acquired infections. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from 2% to 7% in women of childbearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of aysmtomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are 7-10%. \n\nUrinary tract infections can affect 10% of people during childhood. Urinary tract infections in children are the most common in uncircumcised males younger than 3 months of age, followed by females younger than one year. Estimates of frequency among children, however, vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and 2 years, 2- 20% were diagnosed with a UTI. \n\nIn the United States, urinary tract infections lead to nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and 100,000 hospitalizations every year. The cost of these infections is high due to both lost time at work and costs of medical care. The direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6 billion USD yearly in the United States. \n\nUrinary tract infections have been described since ancient times. The first written description, found in the Ebers Papyrus, dates to around the 1550 BC. The Egyptians described a urinary tract infection as \" sending forth heat from the bladder. \" Herbs, bloodletting, and rest were the common treatments until the 1930s, when antibiotics became available. \n\nPregnant women with UTIs have a higher risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone (a hormone) levels decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder. Decreased muscle tone leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and toward the kidneys. If bacteria are present, pregnant women have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus treatment is recommended if urine testing shows signs of an infection\u2014even in the absence of symptoms. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because those medications are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, or seizures). \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-29T12:25:09Z", "text_length": 20572}

{"title": "Croup", "parsed_text": "Croup (or laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat. This swelling causes problems with normal breathing. People with croup can have a \" barking \" cough, stridor (a high-pitched wheezing sound), and hoarseness. Croup symptoms often get worse at night. Taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition. Sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases. Hospitalization is rarely required. \n\nDoctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities (for example, an airway foreign body). Blood tests, X-rays, and cultures are not needed. Croup is common. About 15% of children between 6 months and 5\u20136 years old get croup. Teenagers and adults rarely get croup. \n\nCroup symptoms include a \" barking \" cough, stridor ( a high pitched sound typically when breathing in), hoarseness, and difficult breathing that are worse at night. The \" barking \" cough can sound like a seal or sea lion. Crying can make the wheezing worse; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed. As croup gets worse, the wheezing can decrease. \n\nOther symptoms are fever, symptoms typical of the common cold), and the skin between the ribs pulling in when the child breathes. Drooling or a sick appearance can mean a different illness. The virus infection leads to swelling in the throat and air passages that can make breathing difficult. \n\nMost croup is caused by a virus infection. Some people call severe laryngotracheitis croup. This disease is caused by a milder virus. Croup also can be laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. These diseases are caused by bacteria and are more severe. \n\nIn 75% of cases, the parainfluenza virus, mainly types 1 and 2, causes croup. Other viruses that can cause croup include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Spasmodic croup (croup with barking) does not have the usual signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treating spasmodic croup is the same as treating regular croup. \n\nBacterial croup includes laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes laryngeal diphtheria; bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis come from a virus infection, followed by a bacteria infection. The most common bacteria that cause croup areStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. \n\n+ The Westley Score: Classification of croup severity \n\nFeature \n\nNumber of points assigned for this feature \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\nChest wall <br /> retraction \n\nNone \n\nMild \n\nModerate \n\nSevere \n\nStridor \n\nNone \n\nWith <br /> agitation \n\nAt rest \n\nCyanosis \n\nNone \n\nWith <br /> agitation \n\nAt rest \n\nLevel of <br /> consciousness \n\nNormal \n\nDisoriented \n\nAir entry \n\nNormal \n\nDecreased \n\nMarkedly decreased \n\nCroup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to make sure it is not another condition that can block the upper airway, especially epiglottitis (an inflammation of the tissue that covers the trachea or windpipe) , something in the airway, subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords), angioedema (swelling underneath the skin), retropharyngeal abscess (pus in the back of the throat), and bacterial tracheitis (bacterial infection in the trachea). \n\nAn X-ray of the neck is not routine, but if it is done, it can show a narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because the narrow shape looks like a church steeple. The steeple sign does not appear in half of cases. \n\nBlood tests and viral cultures (tests for the virus) can cause irritate the airway. Cultures of the virus, obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration (using a tube to suck mucus out of the nose), are used to confirm the exact cause. These cultures are restricted to people doing research. If a person does not improve with standard treatment, further tests can be done to check for bacteria. \n\nSeverity \n\nThe most common system for describing the severity of croup is the Westley score. This test is used for research, but does not help the person with croup. Points are given for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis (blue skin coloring), stridor (wheezing), air entry, and retractions (skin on the chest pulling in). The table to the right lists the points given for each factor; the final score ranges from 0 to 17. \n\nA total score of \u2264 2 points indicates mild croup. The person can have barking cough and hoarseness, but there is no stridor (wheezing) when the person is resting. \n\nA total score of 3\u20135 is moderate croup \u2014 the person has wheezing, with few other signs. \n\nA total score of 6\u201311 is severe croup. The patient has obvious wheezing and the skin on the chest wall indraws or pulls in. \n\nA total score of \u2265 12 means respiratory failure is possible. The barking cough and wheezing does not always happen at this stage. \n\n85% of children going to the emergency department have mild disease. Severe croup is rare\u2013less than 1% of cases. \n\nImmunization (vaccines) for influenza and diphtheria can prevent croup. \n\nIt is important to keep children with croup as calm as possible. Children often are given steroids, but epinephrine is used in severe cases. If the amount of blood oxygen is under 92%, the child needs oxygen. People with severe croup can be hospitalized for observation. If oxygen is needed, \" blow-by \" administration (holding an oxygen source near the face of the child) is better than an oxygen mask, because it is less likely to upset a child than an oxygen mask is. With treatment, less than 0.2% of people need endotracheal intubation(a tube placed into the airway). \n\nCorticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, can be used to treat croup. People begin to improve a lot within six hours after taking steroids. Steroids work when given by mouth, injection, or inhalation (breathing them in), but taking them by mouth is best. Most of the time, a single dose is enough. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally good. \n\nModerate to severe croup can be helped with nebulized epinephrine(an inhaled solution that widens the airway). While epinephrine reduces croup severity within 10\u201330 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If symptoms improve for 2\u20134 hours after treatment and no other complications happen, the child typically can leave the hospital. \n\nThere is not enough evidence that other treatments for croup are helpful. Clinical studies do not show that breathing hot steam or humidified air is helpful and currently it rarely is used. Medical professionals do not want people to use cough medicines, which containdextromethorphan and/or guiafenesin. Clinical studies also do not support inhaling heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to make it easier to breath. Since most cases of croup is are diseases, antibiotics are not used unless bacteria are also suspected. The antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended for bacterial infections. In severe cases associated with influenza A or B, theanti neuraminidase inhibitors can be given. \n\nMost of the time, croup caused by a virus is a short-term disease. Croup rarely causes death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms improve within two days, but can last for up to seven days. Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis (infection of the trachea), pneumonia (lung infection), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). \n\nAbout 15% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5\u20136 years will get croup. Croup accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions for this age group. In rare cases, children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years have croup. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females; croup is more common in autumn (fall). \n\nThe word croup comes from the Early Modern English verb croup, meaning \" to cry hoarsely \" ; the name was first used for the disease in Scotland. Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's Ancient Greece. In 1826, Bretonneau distinguished croup from a virus and croup due to diphtheria. The French called croup from a virus \" faux-croup, \" using \" croup \" for a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria. Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown since most people are immunized. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-21T16:58:20Z", "text_length": 10885}

The death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent. Septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck Europe in 1348, the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague. This disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect. In rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human. In septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood, causing severe sepsis. The endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas. This causes the cells in the area to die. DIC uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot, so that it can no longer control bleeding. This means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and coughing up or vomiting of blood (hemoptysis/haemoptysis). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites. These bumps are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die.

It is an autoimmune disease - a disease where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells. When a person has RA, their immune system attacks the joints and the tissues around the joints in the body. This causes different problems, like: \n\nThe capsules around the joints get swollen \n\nThe body makes too much synovial fluid (the special fluid that is supposed to cushion the joints) \n\nTough fibrous tissue builds up in the synovium area (which is also supposed to help cushion the joints) \n\nEventually, RA can destroy a person's articular cartilage. Normally, articular (having to do with the joints) cartilage covers the end of bones where they come together to form joints. This keeps the bones from rubbing against each other. If the articular cartilage has been destroyed by RA, the bones will rub against each other, which is very painful. \n\nNo one knows what causes RA, but some theories are that it has to do with hormones, environment, infection and genes. There is no cure, but doctors have determined ways to help slow down and reduce the impact of the disease. Women are two to three times more likely than men to get rheumatoid arthritis. Most cases of RA occur in people between the ages of 25 and 55. \n\nRA was first recognized around 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais. \n\nSymptoms may include: \n\nSwelling, stiffness, and pain around affected joints \n\nFever \n\nA feeling of discomfort and tiredness \n\nOften, people with RA also develop anemia, a different disease that causes a person to have not enough blood cells in the blood. \n\nLess often, a person with RA could have: \n\ninflamed blood vessels \n\nneck pain \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-10-01T21:34:21Z", "text_length": 2426}

{"title": "Teenage pregnancy", "parsed_text": "Teenage pregnancy is a situation which involves female adolescents. A teenage female is a female between 13 to 21 in age. But sometimes preteens (people under 13) can become pregnant as well. The fact that teenagers become pregnant is related to many factors. These are related to the specific situation of the teenager, and the group that she interacts with. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary from country to country and are related to differences of sexual activities, the general sex education and contraceptives being available. Teen pregnancy will sometimes involve low birth weight. Social matters also play a role: Often, the teenager grew up in poverty. She also often has a lower level of general education. Pregnancy in teenagers in the developed world usually occurs outside of marriage. The lowest levels of teenage pregnancy are in Japan and South Korea. \n\nTeenage pregnancies have a number of problems: \n\nThere is a higher risk that babies born from teenage mothers are born too early, or that they have a low weight at birth. \n\nThe mothers may also encounter complications or difficulties at birth; they have a higher risk of anaemia than mothers aged 20\u201324. \n\nA pregnancy is best followed by trained medical staff during its course. Teenage mothers are less likely to receive prenatal care, often seeking it in the third trimester, if at all. The Guttmacher Institute reports that one-third of pregnant teens receive insufficient prenatal care and that their children are more likely to suffer from health issues in childhood or be hospitalized than those born to older women. \n\nLike most other teenagers, teenage mothers may suffer from poor nutrition. This may lead to them having specific illnesses related to bad nutrition. Bad nutrition is a more marked problem of teenagers in developed countries. \n\nUp to 70,000 teen girls in developing countries die from complications during pregnancy each year. Young mothers and their babies are also at greater risk of contracting HIV. The World Health Organization estimates that the risk of death following pregnancy is twice as high for women between 15 and 19 years than for those between the ages of 20 and 24. The maternal mortality rate can be up to five times higher for girls aged between 10 and 14 than for women of about twenty years of age. Illegal abortion also holds many risks for teenage girls in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nRisk for complications are higher for girl 14 years or younger, because their pelvis has not yet developed fully; this may lead to probems with childbirth. Some of these problems can be dealt with using Cesarean section (C Section)This requires the services of a doctor, or a hospital, which is often unavailable. Where this is unavailable, eclampsia, obstetric fistula, infant mortality, or maternal death can result. For mothers in their late teens, age in itself is not a risk factor, and poor outcomes are associated more with socioeconomic factors rather than with biology. \n\nProblems other than the age of the mother, such as poverty and social support also affect the outcome. It is important that teenage mothers can rely on the family and the state to help them cope, and educate their child. Teenage parents who can rely on family and community support, social services and child-care support are more likely to continue their education and get higher paying jobs as they progress with their education. \n\nBeing a young mother often affects education.Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school. Recent studies, though, have found that many of these mothers had already dropped out of school prior to becoming pregnant. One study in 2001 found that women who gave birth during their teens completed secondary-level schooling 10\u201312% as often and pursued post-secondary education 14\u201329% as often as women who waited until age 30. \n\nA large cause of teenage pregnancy is a lack of education about sex and pregnancy. The first to be blamed are schools and teachers, but the real starting point should be from within the family. Sometimes parents might think talking about sex is inappropriate or that it is automatically encouraging their children to have sex, so they avoid talking about it entirely. This leaves kids with information only from their peers, which often includes pressure to engage in sex acts to meet social standards. Parents should realize that in attempting to protect their children from the reality of human sexuality they are causing more harm than good. Open discussion about sex in a safe, nonjudgmental environment is essential to helping minors make educated decisions about sex. Pediatricians also take it upon themselves to make up for the information that has not been properly communicated to teens, and continually recognize better education as the key to helping reduce teen pregnancy. \n\n<link rel= \" mw:PageProp/Category \" href= \" ./Category:Biological_reproduction \" />", "timestamp": "2020-02-22T00:26:45Z", "text_length": 6653}

{"title": "Ectopic pregnancy", "parsed_text": "An ectopic pregnancy is a when an embryo implants itself (sticks to somewhere) outside the uterus. In a normal pregnancy, the embryo implants (sticks) itself into the wall of the uterus. The uterus is the only place in the body where an embryo can grow into a fetus. \n\nMost ectopic pregnancies happen in a Fallopian tube (one of the two tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus). For this reason, ectopic pregnancies are often called tubal pregnancies. Rarely, ectopic pregnancies can happen in an ovary or in the cervix. \n\nEctopic pregnancies cannot become normal pregnancies, and will not result in a baby. They can also cause serious health problems for the mother. \n\nRisk factors (things that make a woman more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy) include: \n\nHaving an ectopic pregnancy before \n\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) \n\nDamage to the Fallopian tubes caused by surgery \n\nFallopian tubes that are not a normal shape \n\nGetting pregnant after having a tubal ligation or while an IUD is in place. \n\nAt first, there may be no symptoms. A woman may not even know she is pregnant at this point. Sometimes she might have pain in her pelvis, or bleeding from her vagina. \n\nBut once the embryo has grown for about 6 to 8 weeks, it gets large enough to make the Fallopian tube rupture (break open). This is a medical emergency, and can kill a woman. \n\nOnce the Fallopian tube has ruptured, it will start to bleed into the abdomen. Symptoms will include: \n\nPain that starts very quickly and is very sharp. The pain will be right above the pubic area, but only on one side at first. \n\nAfter a while, the pain will spread to the rest of the abdomen. As the Fallopian tube bleeds, the blood irritates the rest of the abdomen and causes pain. \n\nEventually, the woman can lose so much blood by bleeding into her abdomen that she can faint, go into shock, or die. \n\nA physician can do an exam of the pelvis to test for sensitivity and pain, to figure out if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. There are also blood tests for the pregnancy hormone hCG. In a normal pregnancy, the hGC levels double every day. Low levels are evidence of a problem, like an ectopic pregnancy. An ultrasound can also be used to see if the embryo is implanted in the uterus or not. \n\nThere are two main ways to treat an ectopic pregnancy if it is diagnosed before the Fallopian tube ruptures. The first is with the medicine methotrexate. If it is given early enough, it can cause an abortion and end the pregnancy. The second is with a surgery called a laparoscopy (a surgery done with a laser). The surgeon makes a small cut in the belly and removes the embryo. A laparoscopy is done after the first few weeks of the pregnancy. \n\nOnce the Fallopian tube ruptures, emergency surgery is needed to fix the broken Fallopian tube and remove the blood from inside the abdomen. The patient may also needed to be treated for blood loss. \n\nAn ectopic pregnancy cannot become a baby. But it can have effects on future pregnancies and fertility. Because in an ectopic pregnancy the embryo usually grows in a Fallopian tube, the Fallopian tube can become damaged. This makes it more likely for another embryo to get stuck there. The likeness of another ectopic pregnancy depends on the amount of damage to the Fallopian tube, and the health of the tubes. However, even after a ectopic pregnancy, it is entirely possible to have a normal pregnancy. \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-12-17T17:54:46Z", "text_length": 4730}

Pregnant women with family history of having diabetes and ethnic background have higher chances of getting the disease. \n\nGestational diabetes is caused when a pregnant woman's body does not produce enough insulin, leading to higher than normal blood sugar levels. Some women with GDM are treated with drugs. However, healthy eating and regular exercise can help to lower the chances of getting GDM. \n\nIt is still unclear what causes gestational diabetes. It may be due to the action of pregnancy hormones, blocking the action of insulin to its receptors. This prevents cells to take in glucose properly. This causes sugar to remain in blood, where it continues to rise. \n\nBabies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can have many problems, such as, being too large (which may make childbirth difficult), lower than normal blood glucose, or being born too early. More serious problems include brain problems or dead before birth.

It is a serious and life threatening health problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time. \n\nIn a healthy body, insulin helps glucose (sugar) get from the blood into the body's cells. There, the cells can use the sugar to make energy. However, when there is not enough insulin in the body, or if a person's body does not react to insulin normally (this is called insulin resistance), too much sugar stays in the blood. This can cause serious health problems. \n\nExtremely high blood sugar means diabetes mellitus, a condition that often causes very high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind, or may be developing under low insulin levels or resistance to insulin. \n\nThree of the early signs of hyperglycemia are \" the 3 polys \" : polydipsia (feeling very thirsty), polyphagia (feeling very hungry), and polyuria (urinating a lot). These things happen because: \n\nThe body senses that its cells are not getting enough sugar. The body triggers hunger, because eating is usually how people get sugar. This causes polyphagia. \n\nThe body senses that there is too much sugar in the blood, and tries to urinate out the extra sugar. This causes polyuria. \n\nBecause the person is urinating so much, they get dehydrated easily and get very thirsty (polydipsia). \n\nOther early signs of high blood sugar include blurred vision, headache, and feeling tired. \n\nIf hyperglycemia gets worse or is not treated, it can cause toxic acids called ketones to build up in the blood and urine. This is called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a medical emergency. \n\nSymptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis can include: \n\nConfusion, seizures, or coma \n\nDifficulty breathing with fruity-smelling breath ( \" ketone breath \" - caused by the body trying to blow off the toxic ketones through breathing out) \n\nWeakness \n\nNausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain", "timestamp": "2015-11-27T02:13:04Z", "text_length": 2041}

{"title": "Sudden infant death syndrome", "parsed_text": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexpected death of a human baby which is unexplained even after an autopsy and investigation. SIDS is sometimes referred to as cot death or crib death. \n\nThe name is only applied to cases where the baby is less than one year old. By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year. Most happen when the infant is 2 to 4 months of age. This is a critical period because the infant's ability to arouse from sleep is not yet mature. SIDS is defined as a syndrome. \n\nBabies are at the highest risk for SIDS during their sleep. Male infants die more often than female infants; about 60% of the cases are male infants. Infants also die more often during winter months. \n\nThe reason for SIDS are unknown, but there are different theories: \n\nProblems with blood flow to the brain \n\nProblems with levels of serotonin \n\nEffects of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum (which causes botulism) \n\nToxic gases \n\nVaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS, and may reduce the risk slightly. \n\nInfanticide and child abuse cases may be misdiagnosed as SIDS due to lack of evidence. and caretakers of infants with SIDS are sometimes falsely accused. Accidental suffocations are also sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS and vice versa. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is particularly important. The death of the infant is typically sudden, without witnesses, and requires an investigation. \n\nA broader term, \u201csudden and unexpected infant death\u201d (SUID) is used to describe all such deaths, regardless of cause. Cases of SUID that remain unexplained after a complete autopsy and review of the circumstances of death and clinical history are classified as SIDS. Thus, SIDS is one of the causes of SUID and accounts for 80% of such deaths. \n\nNobody knows what causes SIDS. However, there are some known risk factors for SIDS. \n\nNot every infant who has one of these risk factors dies from SIDS. Risk factors just make it more likely for a baby to have SIDS. \n\nSIDS happens more in infants of mothers who smoke while they are pregnant. The higher the levels of nicotine in the infant's blood, the higher the risk of SIDS. Nicotine causes important changes in the way a fetus develops during pregnancy, which have been linked to SIDS as well as miscarriages. \n\nInfants who are put to sleep on their stomachs or sides are more likely to die of SIDS. This risk is highest in infants who are two to three months old. The \" Back to Sleep \" movement has encouraged parents to put their infants to sleep on their backs to prevent SIDS. \n\nOther things that increase the risk for SIDS while an infant is sleeping include: \n\nA hot or cold bedroom \n\nHaving many blankets in the infant's crib, or a lot of clothing on the infant \n\nSoft sleeping surfaces \n\nHaving stuffed animals in the crib \n\nSome researchers think these things can make it difficult for infants to control their body temperature, making them unable to control their breathing. \n\nInfants are more likely to die of SIDS if they share a bed with parents or older children. This risk is highest: \n\nWhen the infant is less than three months old; \n\nWhen the mattress is soft; \n\nWhen one or more people share the infant's bed; and \n\nWhen people in the bed are using drugs or alcohol, or are smoking. \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that if parents share a room with an infant without sharing a bed, they can cut their infant's risk of SIDS in half. \n\nInfants who are breastfed are less likely to die of SIDS. The more an infant has been breastfed, the less likely they are to die of SIDS. \n\nSIDS is less likely to happen in infants of older mothers. Infants of teenage mothers are at the highest risk. \n\nAn infant is also at a higher risk of SIDS if: \n\nTheir mother did not get good prenatal care while she was pregnant \n\nThe infant weighs less than normal when they are born (this is called low birth weight) \n\nThe infant is born too soon (prematurely). Premature infants are four times more likely to die of SIDS. \n\nThe infant has anemia \n\nSIDS only happens at certain ages. The risk of SIDS is highest in infants from two to four months old. After the infant reaches one year old, the risk decreases and eventually reaches zero. \n\nGenetics affect the risk of SIDS. Baby boys have about a 50% higher risk of SIDS than baby girls. Scientists think this might be because of an allele that exists on the X chromosome. They think this allele helps protect against episodes where the brain does not get enough oxygen (transient cerebral anoxia). Baby boys would be more likely to be missing this allele. \n\nScientists think that about 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are caused by inherited defects in the ion channels that help the heart squeeze out blood. \n\nThe risk of SIDS seems to be affected by things like how much education an infant's mother got, race, ethnicity, and poverty. \n\nVaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS. Most studies have shown that getting vaccinations cuts an infant's risk of a SIDS death in half. \n\nSIDS may be more common in babies with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli (E. coli) infections, but scientists are not sure. \n\nPutting infants to sleep on their backs can help prevent SIDS. The number of SIDS deaths has fallen in countries where this is commonly done. Also, if parents share a room with their infant but do not share a bed, they can cut their baby's risk of SIDS in half. \n\nParents can help prevent SIDS by not using pillows, very soft mattresses, stuffed animals, or fluffy blankets in their infant's crib. Dressing the infant warmly and keeping the crib \" naked \" lowers the risk of SIDS. \n\nIf an infant has a blanket in the crib, they should be covered only up to their chest, with their arms left outside the blanket. This makes it harder for the infant to move the blanket over their head, which could cause breathing problems. \n\nIn colder places where infants need help staying warm, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using a \" sleep sack. \" This is like a sleeping bag for a baby, but with holes for the baby's arms and head. The bag is closed around the baby with a zipper. This helps keep the baby warm without covering their head. Sleep sacks are especially helpful for babies with low birth weight, who have more trouble keeping themselves warm. \n\nMany studies have shown that vaccines normally given to infants help prevent SIDS. For example, one very large research study showed that giving infants vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis helps prevent SIDS. \n\nGetting normal infant vaccines cuts infants' risk of SIDS in half, according to many studies. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-13T02:56:22Z", "text_length": 9607}

There are other blood problems that are not blood cancers. A blood doctor also helps people with those problems. \n\nTumors of the hematopoietic (blood cell forming) and lymphoid tissues are local growths. Hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies are cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. As the blood and lymph connect through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well. \n\nThere are three types: \n\nLeukemia \n\nLymphoma \n\nMultiple myeloma \n\nA doctor will do some tests to find out if a person has a blood cancer. One common test is a complete blood count. The cells that circulate in the bloodstream are generally divided into three types: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). The relative proportions is what picks up indications of a problem. \n\nSometimes the doctor will take a very small piece of the body out, to look at it. This is called a biopsy. Bone marrow is where new blood is made in the body. A bone marrow biopsy looks at the blood-making parts to see if they have cancer. \n\nPeople with blood cancer often take drugs called chemotherapy or immunotherapy. If the blood cancer is in one place, they may have radiotherapy. A bone marrow transplant is a difficult way to kill blood cancers. \n\nThousands of people get blood cancers.

{"title": "Antisocial personality disorder", "parsed_text": "Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder in which a person fails to conform with socially accepted behavior. People with this disorder often disregard social norms or the rights of other people. Other names for the condition are sociopathy and dissocial personality disorder (DPD). However, because of the many definitions of sociopathy, that word is no longer used in a medical context. \n\nThe ASPD pattern begins in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. People with ASPD have no conscience or sense of morality, although the large majority know right from wrong. Those with ASPD often commit crimes, have legal problems, and show behavior that is aggressive and, in the large majority of cases, impulsive, reckless and destructive. About three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD. \n\nAccording to the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-IV), a person has ASPD if they fit the following requirements: \n\nA. Since age 15, the person has shown a pattern of not caring about and violating others' rights. This pattern must be pervasive, meaning that the person habitually acts this way in different settings. This pattern is shown by at least three of the following actions: \n\n#The person does not obey the law, and repeatedly does things for which he or she could be arrested \n\n#The person often deliberately misleads and deceives others. He or she may do this by lying repeatedly, using aliases (false names), or conning other people (either for money or enjoyment). \n\n#The person is impulsive or does not plan ahead. \n\n#The person becomes irritated or angry easily and is aggressive. He or she repeatedly gets into physical fights or assaults others. \n\n#The person shows no concern for other people's safety or his/her own safety. \n\n#The person is consistently irresponsible. He or she may not try to keep a job or honor financial obligations, like bills and debts. \n\n#The person shows no remorse for hurting others; he or she hurts, steals from, or treats others badly, without remorse. \n\nB. To be diagnosed with ASPD, the person must be at least 18 years old. \n\nC. By age 15, he or she seemed to exhibit conduct disorder. \n\nD. The person's antisocial behavior is not caused by schizophrenia or a manic episode. \n\nASPD is not the same as psychopathy. The two are similar; people with both conditions may show similar behaviors. However, they are diagnosed differently. Using the DSM criteria, a diagnosis of ASPD is based on a person's behaviors. No official, agreed-upon definition or set of diagnostic criteria exists for psychopathy, but most tools that measure psychopathy focus on personality characteristics as well as behaviors. \n\nMost people who score highly on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), the most popular measure of psychopathy, also qualify for ASPD. However, people with ASPD do not routinely score high on the PCL-R. This suggests that most psychopaths qualify for ASPD, but most people with ASPD do not qualify as psychopaths. The diagnosis of ASPD covers most psychopaths, as well as many more people who are not psychopaths. The diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as the diagnosis of psychopathy does. \n\nDepending on the behaviour, different ASPD subtypes have been identified: \n\nIntrumentalized type: People classified in this subtype care about power, material goods and money. They are very self-confident and lack feelings such as remorse, empathy or fear. They do not want to change their behaviour. This type is very similar to what used to be called \" psychopathy. \" \n\nImpulsive type: These people are very impulsive, have difficulty controlling their actions, and are quick to judge other people's actions as negative. In most cases, the person suffering will not notice this inability. These people are also very emotional; emotions such as fear and anger are common. They are easily frustrated and quickly show aggressive behaviour. These people do not look for material gain. \n\nFearful type: These people often suffer from depression, and are shy or fearful. When provoked, their level of violent behaviour is excessive, and often greater than that of the other types. Outside these eruptions they are in control, and hardly get noticed. Very often, this group has lived through traumatic events. \n\nMixed types also occur. There is a debate on the subtypes. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-04-07T12:37:44Z", "text_length": 5108}

{"title": "Silent stroke", "parsed_text": "A silent stroke is a kind of stroke that does not cause symptoms that can be seen in a major stroke such as slurred speech. A person who has had a silent stroke usually does not know it. A silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. \n\nThese strokes are called \" silent \" because they typically happen in parts of the brain that do not cause problems that can be seen like those in a major stroke. A silent stroke usually happens in parts of the brain that control different thought processes, mood regulation and cognitive functions and is a leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment and may also lead to a loss of urinary bladder control. \n\nIn a big study in 1998, more than 11 million people were thought to have had a stroke in the United States. About 770,000 of these strokes had symptoms which could be seen and 11 million were first-ever silent strokes. Silent strokes usually cause lesions which are found by the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. \n\nThere is more of chance of older people having a silent stroke but it may also happen to younger adults. Women appear to be at higher risk for silent stroke, with hypertension and current cigarette smoking being some of the reasons. \n\nThese types of strokes include lacunar and other ischemic strokes and minor hemorrhages. They may also include leukoaraiosis (changes in the white matter of the brain): the white matter is more susceptible to vascular blockage because it has less blood vessels than the cerebral cortex. \n\nIn the Cardiovascular Health Study, a study used 3,660 adults over the age of 65, 31% showed evidence of silent stroke in neuroimaging studies using MRI. These people did not know they had a stroke. It is thought that silent strokes are five times more common than strokes that have symptoms. \n\nA silent stroke is different than a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In TIA the symptoms can be seen and may last from a few minutes to 24 hours before getting better. If a person has a TIA there is a bigger chance they may have a major stroke and silent strokes in the future. \n\nIschemic stroke: occurs when a blood vessel that brings blood to the brain becomes blocked. This type of stroke happens in 87 percent of all stroke cases. \n\nHemorrhagic stroke: occurs when a blood vessel that brings blood to the brain gets weak and splits open causing bleed to come out of the blood vessel. Usually hemorrhagic stroke is caused by two kinds of problems that cause weak blood vessels: aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). \n\nLacunar infarcts (LACI) are small (0.2 to 15 mm in diameter) noncortical (does not happen in the cerebral cortex) stroke caused by the blockage of a single penetrating branch of a larger blood vessel that brings blood to the inside parts of the brain including the white matter. LACIs are usually happen in cases of white matter lesions (WML) which can be seen using computerized tomography (CT scans). \n\n", "timestamp": "2016-05-04T00:30:29Z", "text_length": 3344}
{"title": "Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood", "parsed_text": "Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short) is a medical problem that happens in children. \" Benign \" means \" harmless; \" \" paroxysmal \" means something comes and goes suddenly; and \" vertigo \" means \" dizziness. \" So BPVC is harmless dizziness in children that comes and goes suddenly. \n\nThe dizziness usually makes children feel like they are moving or spinning, or that the inside of their head is moving or spinning. \n\nUsually, BPVC starts in children between two and five years old. It often goes away by the age of eight. But in some children, BPVC may start when they are much younger (as young as a few months old) or older (as old as 12 years old). \n\nBPVC is the most common cause of dizziness in children who do not have hearing loss or a diagnosed ear disease. It is a common problem that happens to about 2.6% of children (26 out of 1,000 children). \n\nDoctors don't know for sure what causes BPVC. Some doctors think it is related to problems of the inner ear that affect balance. For example, some doctors think BPVC is similar to a different disorder which often happens in adults over 50. This disorder is called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is a \" vestibular disorder \" - a disorder in the inner ear which affects balance. \n\nOther doctors believe BPVC is related to migraine headaches, but most children with BPVC do not get headaches. \n\nNystagmus (sometimes called \" dancing eyes \" ): Fast, uncontrollable eye movements. These eye movements may happen on their own or be caused by staring. When a child with BPVC is not having other symptoms, they may have positional nystagmus, which happens when the head is in a certain position. \n\nNausea: Feeling like throwing up. \n\nVomiting: Throwing up. \n\nGait ataxia: Problems walking because a medical problem (like BPVC) makes the muscles not work together. This symptom may be harder to see in infants who cannot walk yet. \n\nPostural imbalance: Having trouble staying balanced, which makes it hard to stand up straight. This symptom may be harder to see in infants who cannot stand yet. \n\nLooking scared: Children may look scared because of the physical symptoms that BPVC is causing, like loss of balance and dizziness. \n\nFor a doctor to diagnose Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood, all of these things must be true: \n\nThe child has had at least five attacks of vertigo. \n\nThe child gets vertigo a lot; the dizziness happens all of a sudden, and goes away after a few minutes to a few hours. \n\nThe child had a normal neurological examination (which tests whether there are problems with how the brain is working) \n\nThe child had normal audiometric and vestibular functions between attacks (this means that between attacks, the child had normal hearing, and there were no obvious problems with the inner ears) \n\nThe child had normal electroencephalography (EEG) (this is a test that looks for unusual electrical activity in the brain). \n\nDifferential diagnoses are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. When a doctor asks what the differential diagnoses for BPVC are, she is asking \" what other disease could cause these symptoms? What else could this be? \" Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, they must think of what other medical conditions have the same or similar symptoms, and make sure one of them is not the problem. \n\nSome of the differential diagnoses for BPVC are: \n\nPosterior fossa tumor: A tumor in the part of the brain that is in or near the bottom of the skull. Posterior fossa tumors happen more in children than they do in adults. About 54%-70% of all brain tumors that children get start in the posterior fossa. \n\nCervical spine abnormalities: Problems with the part of the spine in the neck. \n\nOtological disorders: Problems with the insides of the ears. \n\nBenign occipital epilepsy: A kind of epilepsy that most children outgrow. \n\nMetabolic disorders: Problems with the way the body makes energy from food. \n\n<References/>", "timestamp": "2020-01-18T09:55:52Z", "text_length": 4456}
{"title": "Menstrual migraine", "parsed_text": "Menstrual migraine (also called catamenial migraine) is term used to describe both true menstrual migraines and menstrually related migraines. About 7%-14% of women have migraines only at the time of menstruation, these are called true menstrual migraines. Most female migraneurs experience migraine attacks throughout the menstruation cycle with an increased number perimenstrually, these are referred to as menstrually related or menstrually triggered migraine. \n\nIt used to believed that treatments for migraine would work in menstrual migraine but that has not proven to be the case because menstrual migraines are harder to treat. Because of this, menstrual migraines are now considered a separate medical disorder from migraine. In 2008, menstrual migraines were given ICD-9 codes (346.4-346.43) of their own which separate menstrual migraine from other types of migraine. \n\nAbout 40% of women and 20% of men will get a migraine at sometime in their life; most of them will get their first migraine before they are 35-years-old.

Menstrually related migraine attacks occur usually between 2 days before and 3 days after the start of menstruation in at least 2 out of 3 menstrual cycles (periods) in a row. Pure menstrual migraine and menstrually related migraine are both migraines without auras with one exceptionnally rare case with aura reported in 2012. \n\nThe Menstrual Migraine Assesment Tool (MMAT) is a simple questionaire with three questions, that has shown to be fairly accurate in diagnosing menstrual migraine (Tepper SJ, 2008). Stewart J. Tepper: The Cleveland Clinic Manual of Headache Therapy, Springer; 1st ed. 2011. pp. 15-16 \n\n</ref> The three questions are: \n\n#Do migraines occur in the space of time 2 days before the beginning of a woman's period, until the third day after the start of the period. And does this happen in most months. \n\n#Do headaches that happen during this time become very severe. \n\n#Does the woman experience photophobia which is when a medical problem cause light to bothers a person's eyes. \n\nThe answer to the first question has to be yes and there has to be at least one yes answer to either question 2 or question 3. \n\nIn order to keep track of what time of the month the migraines happen it is helpful to use a headache diary. A person uses the headache diary to write down information about their headaches, like when they started, what kind of symptoms they had and how bad the pain was etc. \n\nOften, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the \" comorbid disorders \" or \" comorbidities \" . There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and prognosis (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders. <br> \n\n:Asthma \n\n:: <font size= \" 3 \"> Premenstrual asthma (PMA): </font> is when asthma symptoms get worse during the premenstrual period. This condition may affect up to 40% of female asthma sufferers. For a diagnosis of PMA to be made it is necessary to have a detailed history of the timing of menstrual cycles along with asthma symptoms experienced, and the peak expiratory flow rate (PMA may cause the PEF to be lowered in the premenstrual period). It is helpful in making a diagnosis to keep a diary of symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates. \n\n:Raynaud\u2019s disease: is a circulatory disorder in which the smaller arteries that supply blood to the extremities - most often the hands, but it may also affect the, toes, the tip of the nose and the ears - become narrower reducing blood flow. This causes the extremities to become numb and to be cooler than the core body temperature. It can be triggered by exposure to stress and cold. \n\n:Epilepsy \n\n:Fibromyalgia \n\nComorbid psychiatric conditions \n\n:Major depressive disorder \n\n:Anxiety \n\n:Bipolar disorder \n\nThere are treatments which are used for menstrual migraines which may in some cases reduce how many times a woman gets them and how bad they are. This kind of treatment is called prophylactic therapy and it is used in the perimenstrual period which is the time between periods. \n\nProphylactic therapy for menstrual migraine should be tried for at least 3 menstruation cycles to see if that kind of treatment works before it is stopped. Medications used may include: \n\nNSAIDS (nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs): \n\n1. Napraxen sodium such as Aleve \n\nBeta blockers \u2014 such as propranolol, nadolol, atenolol, and metoprolol Garza I and Swanson, JW Prophylaxis of migraine. Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. 2006 September; 2(3): 281\u2013291. \n\nPMCID: PMC2671824 </ref> \n\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and other kinds of antidepressant medications are often used for migraine prevention. These include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and doxepin. \n\nAcute treatments (short-term treatment) include drugs called Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (drugs that help stop inflammation which is redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, heat in parts of the body), triptans such as Frovatriptan, ergotomines which are a kind of drug made from a fungus called ergot, and estrogen transdermal patches, which are patches worn on the skin that have estrogen in them which enters the body through the skin and then into the bloodstream. \n\nThe exact causes of menstrual migraine are not known for sure but there is a link between falling levels of the female hormone estrogen and the onset of a migraine attack. The estrogen level may fall after bleeding occurs during the menstrual cycle or when external sources of estrogen are no longer taken, like when a woman stops taking birth control pills or hormone pills in hormone replacement therapy. \n\nOptimizing Management of Menstrual Migraine \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-06-28T00:40:36Z", "text_length": 12384}
{"title": "Aura (symptom)", "parsed_text": "An aura is the changes that people see, hear, smell, taste, or feel before they have an epileptic seizure, or before they have a migraine. It comes from the Greek word for breeze. The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition. \n\nThere are different kinds of migraines. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems like not being able to see for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus), and problems speaking. It may take up to an hour after the aura begins before a person starts getting a migraine. \n\nMany people with epilepsy have an aura before having a seizure. This can be helpful, because the aura can tell the person that a seizure is coming ahead of time, and give them time to get to a safe place. The time between the aura and the seizure is usually short (often from seconds to minutes). \n\nThere are other neurological conditions which can cause aura-like symptoms. These include strokes and panic attacks, for example. \n\nDifficulty speaking \n\nVertigo: a kind of dizziness where the person feels as if the world is spinning or moving around them or there is a feeling of spinning or moving in their head. \n\nScotomas: blind spots in the person's vision \n\nScintillating scotomas, also called teichopsia: seeing bright wavy lines or a spot with flickering lights, which gets bigger and grows into one or more arcs or curves of shimmering white light or colored flickering lights. \n\nFortification: seeing zig-zag lines \n\nChanges in vision \n\nPhotopsia: flashes of light \n\nTinnitus: a ringing noise in the ears \n\nMuscle weakness \n\nBilateral facial pain: pain in both the left and right side of the face \n\nTingling feelings \n\nNumbness: usually following the tingling sensation there is numbness (you can not feel very much or not at all) one side of the body. This can happen in the arm, leg, and/or one side \n\nMuscle weakness: usually on one side of the body \n\nAlice in Wonderland Syndrome: these are a type of hallucination (something a person sees that is not real). These types of hallucinations may make other people or things look much smaller than they really are (micropsia) or bigger than they really are (macropsia) \n\nScotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: skotos): a blind spot or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. Scotomas may affect one or both eyes. They can be either absolute, where the person can see nothing within the scotoma, or relative, where the person can see something within the scotoma, but less than usual. \n\n:Negative scotoma: an area of partial or total blindness. Usually it is followed by a scintillating scotoma, but the negative scotoma may be surrounded by a scintillating scotoma. A negative scotoma may be either be an absolute scotoma and may seem like a blank spot where the person can not see any light, or a relative scotoma in which some light may be seen but less than normal, the scotoma may be blurry as if looking through thick plastic. Negative scotomas are usually not noticed by a person and are found by an eye or ophthalmic examination. \n\n:Positive scotoma: an area of vision loss or blockage that may be seen as a dark or black spot or the blockage of vision may be what seem to be various shapes or lines that may change in brightness i.e they may get darker and lighter so it seems like a flickering light. \n\n::Fortification scotoma (AKA:teichopsia): seeing lines that look like the lines of a fort. The lines may be gray or colored and the brightness may change from darker to lighter so that they appear to be flickering then the fortification scotoma may be called a scintillating scotoma. \n\n::Scintillating scotoma: is the progression of a fortification scotoma i.e When the lines seen in a fortificatin scotoma change in brightness rapidly so they look like flickering lights. This is one of the most common scotomas a person who has a migraine with aura may see. It usually starts as a spot of flickering lights in the center of a person's visual field it then gets larger. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-01-11T01:05:03Z", "text_length": 5657}
{"title": "Bell's palsy", "parsed_text": "Bell's palsy is a paralysis of the face on one side. It is caused by inflammation of a facial nerve. The sufferer cannot move the muscles on the affected side of the face. \n\nSeveral conditions can cause facial paralysis, such as brain tumors, strokes, and Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell. Bell first described the disease. It is the most common acute disease involving only one nerve, and it is the most common cause of sudden facial nerve paralysis. \n\nBell's palsy involves a rapid start of partial or complete paralysis that often occurs overnight. Scientists believe that inflammation leads to swelling of the facial nerve. The nerve travels through the skull in a narrow bone canal beneath the ear. Nerve swelling and compression in the narrow bone canal are thought to stop the nerve from working. At times of lowered immunity, a dormant (sleeping) virus, usually the chicken pox or cold sore virus, can wake up and attack the nerve causing it to swell. The main symptoms of Bell's palsy are one-sided facial paralysis, jaw pain, dizziness, strengthened hearing in one ear, and weakened taste sense. \n\nBell's palsy usually cures itself, sometimes in a few weeks. Corticosteroids (cortisone steroids) have been found to improve the condition while anti-viral drugs have not. Early treatment is necessary for steroids or drugs to be effective, but it is controversial wether or not they work. Most people recover spontaneously and achieve near-normal to normal functions. Some people however will never regain full facial movement, or it may take a longer time. Many show signs of improvement as early as 10 days after the onset, even without treatment. \n\nOften those suffering from Bell's palsy cannot close the eye in the affected side. The eye must be protected from drying up, or the cornea may be permanently damaged. The affected eye may need to be taped shut when sleeping. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-06-20T01:29:10Z", "text_length": 2176}

The retina is at the back of the inside of the eye. In medicine a spasm is a sudden constriction or tightening of muscles that is involuntary - a person does not control them they move on their own. Muscle spasms can happen in different muscles of the body, like when a person's leg or eye twitches. The twitching is caused by the spasms. \n\nVaso- means something to do with the blood vessels, so a vasospasm causes the muscle cells inside the walls of a blood vessel to suddenly constrict or tighten up. This causes the whole blood vessel to constrict which means makes the blood vessel narrower. When a blood vessel constricts it is called vasoconstriction. \n\nWhen vasoconstriction happens less blood the normal is able to flow through the blood vessel, like the way squeezing (constricting) a garden hose makes less water come out. Vasoconstriction can happen for different reasons including because of a medical problem. \n\nThe second part of a vasospasm -vasodilation - occurs after the vasoconstriction. After the blood vessel constricts it dilates - becomes bigger. It may return to normal size or slightly larger than normal size. \n\nThe vasoconstriction and vasodilation complete one spasm. Spasms often happen many times over and over again. It is beleved that the muscle cells tigntening and loosenening may trigger the pain of a retinal migraine. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-06-28T00:54:35Z", "text_length": 2170}

{"title": "Diverticulitis", "parsed_text": "Diverticulitis is a disease of the digestive system. It is caused by inflammation of pouches (diverticula) in the walls of the bowel. It usually occurs in the large intestine. Diverticula can also be in the upper digestive tract at the level of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. \n\nSymptoms of diverticulitis depend on the extent of inflammation in the intestine. Diverticulitis can be very painful. The pain is usually present in the lower abdomen on the left side. People with diverticulitis can also have nausea, vomiting, difficulty or pain while passing urine and changes in bowel habits. \n\nOne of the complications of diverticulitis can be the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity. The inflammation or infection can then reach the abdominal wall and causes peritonitis. This infection can also spread to other parts of the body such as organs near the intestine, causing sepsis, which is dangerous. In addition, a fistula may form between the intestine and other organs. Diverticulitis may also cause a blockage in the colon. \n\nTo prevent diverticulitis, it is important to be active and to have a diet rich in fibers. These include eating (fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals). It is also possible to reduce the risks of diverticulitis in several ways: chew foods before swallowing, defecate as soon as you feel the need, eat less fats and meats, do more physical activities, eat probiotics and drink water regularly. \n\nTo diagnose diverticulitis, it is important to do a barium enema X-ray to see the shape of the intestine wall. Diverticula can be seen with a axial tomographie scan (CT scan). It is also possible to prescribe an abdominal radiograph to indicate if there is a perforation. After the acute phase or absence of acute diverticulitis, the doctor can prescribe a colonoscopy to look at the colon and determine the evolution of the disease. \n\nThe resection of the colon is the procedure most often used to treat severe diverticulitis. It is also possible to do a resection of the diseased part of the colon and make a colostomy. In fact, if a diverticulitis is too large, a colostomy could be necessary either temporarily or permanently. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-08-12T07:38:42Z", "text_length": 2619}
{"title": "Decompression sickness", "parsed_text": "Decompression sickness is caused by bubbles which form in the blood and other body parts of people who have the pressure around them decrease too quickly. These bubbles may block the flow of blood and starve the body parts of oxygen, or the bubbles may cause damage by stretching, tearing, or pressing on the affected parts. Decompression sickness is also called the bends. \n\nDecompression sickness can happen to underwater divers who spend a lot of time in deep water, and return to the surface too quickly for the breathing gases dissolved in their bodies to escape without forming bubbles. \n\nPeople can also get decompression sickness if they are in a pressurised aeroplane or spacecraft and it is damaged and the air is lost. \n\nDecompression sickness can be prevented by decreasing the pressure slowly. This allows the gases which have dissolved in the body to get out in the breathing air without forming bubbles. Divers do this by coming up to the surface slowly, as the pressure depends on the depth, and reducing the depth will reduce the pressure. For each ten metres change of depth the pressure will change by 1 bar, which is about the same as normal air pressure at sea level. \n\nDivers find out how slowly to come up by using decompression tables or a dive computer. They may need to stop on the way up to wait for enough gas to get out before it is safe to go up further. This is called a decompression stop. The tables or computer will inform the divers what depths they must stop at and how long they must stay at each depth. \n\nPeople flying high in aircraft avoid decompression by being in a pressurized cabin. In military aircraft the crew may breathe oxygen before the flight for a few hours so most of the nitrogen that is dissolved in their bodies can escape. This is called oxygen prebreathing. \n\nAstronauts preparing for a spacewalk also prebreathe oxygen and decompress inside the spacecraft before getting into their suit and going outside. \n\nWhen a person breathes, the air or other breathing gas dissolves into the blood from the lungs. This takes some time, and the amount of gas that can dissolve depends on the pressure around the person. If the pressure is greater, more gas can dissolve. After a while no more gas can dissolve at that pressure. \n\nWhen a diver goes deeper, the pressure gets greater. This makes more gas dissolve in the diver. At the end of the dive the diver must return to the surface of the water where there is less pressure. \n\nIf the diver goes up slowly the pressure will change slowly, and there will be enough time for the gas dissolved in the diver to return from the blood to the breathing gas in the divers lungs and it will be safely removed. If the pressure change is too quick for enough of the dissolved gas to be removed, the gas may form bubbles in the blood and other parts of the diver's body. These bubbles will get bigger when the pressure gets less as the diver gets nearer to the surface. Bubbles which are in the blood may get stuck in small blood vessels. If this happens in the lungs they will usually do no great harm but if they block the blood flow in other parts of the body, the parts where the flow is blocked will not get enough oxygen and may be damaged. This is very dangerous if it happens in the brain or heart. The other place where bubbles may form is in the more solid parts of the body. If these bubbles grow enough they may tear the parts around them or press against them hard enough to do damage. \n\nIf a diver gets decompression sickness it can be treated by putting the diver in a decompression chamber, and increasing the pressure to squeeze the bubbles to a smaller size where they do less harm, and by giving the diver pure oxygen to breathe, which helps to get the bubbles to dissolve again. The oxygen also helps to stop more damage to the body by the bubbles which have blocked blood vessels, as there is more oxygen in the blood to keep the parts alive which have less blood supply because of the blockages.", "timestamp": "2019-01-02T22:29:46Z", "text_length": 4190}

Also, a person might eat a healthier diet to lose weight. There are many diet and exercises programs available to lose weight. Many people lose weight when they eat less sugar and more vegetables, fruits and lean meat. \n\nHealth related - losing weight because of sickness like flu and fever, or even more serious like cancer and HIV. \n\nExercise related - when weight loss is caused by using more energy than you provide to your body - this will end up in burning your reserves - fat. \n\nDiet related - by lowering the energy intake or some part of diet causing fat to be burned. \n\nIn many countries weight loss is caused by sociological pressure mostly on woman to have slim and fit figure. \n\nUnintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals. \n\nGetting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits. \n\nWithout going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss. \n\nYour body also burns calories while you sleep. \n\nIt is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories. \n\nExercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-15T06:38:57Z", "text_length": 3504}

However it is possible that at least 90% of these new cases could be kept from becoming severe with early diagnosis and proper treatment. \n\nDiabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), they can bleed (ocular hemorrhage) and blur vision. The first time this happens, it may not be very severe. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after a few hours. \n\nThese spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs vision. In extreme cases, a person will only be able to tell light from dark in that eye. It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep. \n\nOn funduscopic exam, a doctor will see spots, flame hemorrhages, and dot-blot hemorrhages. \n\nElevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens as a result of sorbitol (sugar alcohol) building up in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness). A common sign of swelling of the lens is blurring of distance vision while near vision remains adequate. \n\nDuring the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless there is macular edema. To prevent diabetic retinopathy from getting worse, diabetics should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. \n\nProliferative retinopathy is treated with scatter laser surgery, which helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels. During the surgery 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns are placed in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink. Two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment. There may be some loss of peripheral (side) vision, and color vision, and night vision may also be slightly reduced. \n\nScatter laser treatment works best before the abnormal fragile, new blood vessels which grow because of the disease have started to bleed. Treatment may still be possible after bleeding has begun in some cases. \n\nMacular edema is treated with focal laser treatment. Up to several hundred small laser burns are placed in the areas of retinal leakage surrounding the macula. These burns cauterize the blood vessels, reduces tha amount of leakage and fluid build-up in the retina. The surgery is usually done in one session but further treatments may be needed. If both eyes are affected by macular edema only one is treated at a time usually a few weeks apart. \n\nFocal laser treatment stabilizes vision and reduces the risk of vision loss by 50 percent. In a small number of cases, if vision is lost, it can be improved. \n\nViteroctomy is the surgical removal of the vitreous humur. The vitreous humur is a clear, thick, gel-like fluid, that fills the inside of the eyeball and helps it to maintain its shape. \n\nThis treatment is done in cases of proliferative retinopathy that causes severe scar tissue to form on the retina or when new blood vessels continue to grow on the retina after laser treatments. \n\nAccording to research done by the National Eye Institute, prompt treatment of diabetic macular edema with the drug Lucentis, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone, or steroid injections. When injected into the eye, Lucentis, and two other similar drugs, Avastin or Aylea, reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. \n\nDiabetic Retinopathy Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI).", "timestamp": "2018-06-28T00:10:34Z", "text_length": 4542}

The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen. \n\nAbdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories: \n\nPrimary or acute abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when injuries within the abdomen are responsible for the compartment syndrome \n\nSecondary abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when there are no visible injury within the abdomen but injuries outside the abdomen cause fluid build-up inside the abdominal cavity \n\nChronic abdominal compartment syndrome occurs happens in association with diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver. \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-06-27T18:23:38Z", "text_length": 1980}
{"title": "Blast injury", "parsed_text": "A blast injury is a wound caused by direct or indirect exposure to an explosive blast. Physical blast injuries are divided into four categories, with a fifth for secondary illnesses caused by the blast, and a sixth category for the effects of associated post-blast psychological trauma such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \n\nThe type and severity of injuries caused by an explosion depends on a variety of factors including type of explosion, force of the explosion, environment in which the explosion occurs, and how close to the explosion the person is. \n\nAn explosion results from the rapid release of energy. Explosions fall into four general categories: \n\nChemical: \n\nA chemical explosion is the result of a rapid chemical reaction or change of state which causes the creation of large amount of heat and usually gas. There are various types of chemical explosions including natural gas explosions, dust explosions and those caused by explosives. \n\nExplosives are categorized as high-order (HE) explosives or low-order (LE) explosives and they each cause different injury patterns. Only (HE) explosives produces a shock wave \n\nHigh-order explosives (HE) detonation causes the explosive material to change into a highly pressurized gas which travels at supersonic speeds creating a 'blast wave' (over-pressurization shock wave). Examples of HE include TNT, C-4, Semtex, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO). Supersonic is when something travels at speeds that are faster than the speed of sound. The speed of sound is about 768 miles per hour (1,236 kilometers per hour) at sea level. \n\nLow-order explosives (LE) deflagrates or burns at a subsonic rate [below 3,300 feet per second], so it does not have HE\u2019s over-pressurization supersonic schock wave. Examples of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based bombs such as Molotov cocktails. \n\nMechanical \n\nElectrical \n\nNuclear \n\n<div style= \" clear:both; \"> </div> \n\nBlast injuries are divided into four classes of physical trauma primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. A fifth category, the quinary injuries, are those caused by toxic substances associated with the blast. \n\nPrimary injuries are caused by the explosion's shock waves. Air and fluid-filled internal organs are most commonly affected, but the blast wave may also cause external injuries such as traumatic amputation. \n\nThe structures of the internal ears are most often affected by the blast wave, with perforated ear drums the most common injury. The most common fatal injury in victims who survive the initial blast is blast lung. Blast lung can result in pulmonary contusions, bleeding and fluid build-up in the lungs with damage to airways and blood vessels. \n\nMost casualties in an explosion are caused by secondary blast injuries. These injuries may be caused by fragments of the explosive device and other objects within the blast zone being propelled by the force of the explosion. These objects may strike any part of the body resulting in penetrating trauma. The severity of the penetrating trauma depends to a degree on the size of the object, the depth of penetration, and the part of the body hit. \n\nSecondary blast injuries are common in deliberate explosions such as those caused by terrorist bombs. The bombs are often designed with objects such as nails, or ball bearings packed in and around the explosive device to act as shrapnel. \n\nThese injuries may also occur in accidental explosions - such as may occur in an industrial accident - when objects in the environment affected by the blast, such as shattered glass take the role of shrapnel. \n\nDisplacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries. \n\nYoung children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury. \n\nQuaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse. \n\nThis category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation (dirty bombs) as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast. \n\nThe psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event. Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries. \n\n<table border= \" 0 \" align= \" right \" style= \" background-color:#FFFFFF \" width= \" 434px \" cellpadding= \" 0 \" cellspacing= \" 4 \"> \n\n<caption> Tertiary blast injury </caption> \n\n\t <tr> \n\n\t\t <td width= \" 182px \" align= \" center \"> \n\n</td> \n\n<td width= \" 252px \"> Coup contrecoup (Fr.

Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma. \n\nIndividuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability. Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring. However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance. These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities. Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation. \n\nConventional Warfare: Ballistic, Blast and Burn Injuries", "timestamp": "2018-06-27T23:51:27Z", "text_length": 8177}

This happens more often with older antipsychotic medicines. Usually, tardive dyskinesia happens when these medicines are taken for many months or years. But some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking these medicines for only 6 weeks. \n\nThe medicines that are most likely to cause tardive dyskinesia are these older antipsychotic medicines: \n\nChlorpromazine (Thorazine) \n\nFluphenazine (Prolixin) \n\nHaloperidol (Haldol) \n\nTrifluoperazine \n\nOther medicines that are similar to these antipsychotics can also cause tardive dyskinesia.

But there are certain groups of people who are more likely to get tardive dyskinesia. The longer a person has been on antipsychotic medicines, the more likely they are to get TD. \n\nMost people who get tardive dyskinesia are people who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and have been on antipsychotic medicines for a long time. But some other people can get tardive dyskinesia too. Some people have a very high risk of getting tardive dyskinesia. They can get TD even after taking an antipsychotic medicine just once. People that have this very high risk include: \n\nPeople with fetal alcohol syndrome \n\nPeople with other developmental disabilities \n\nPeople with brain diseases or injuries \n\nThe symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are movements of the face, lips, tongue, torso, arms, and legs.

For example, people with tardive dyskinesia often cannot stop themselves from: \n\nSmacking their lips \n\nPushing their tongue out \n\nSwinging their jaw \n\nMoving their mouth like they are chewing or sucking \n\nMoving their fingers, arms, or legs \n\nOften, people with tardive dyskinesia also have akathisia. This is a constant urge to move, or always being restless. \n\nDoctors can try to prevent tardive dyskinesia by: \n\nUsing the lowest possible dose of antipsychotic medicine \n\nUsing antipsychotic medicine for the shortest possible time \n\nUsing newer (atypical) antipsychotic medicines instead of older antipsychotics which are more likely to cause TD \n\nChecking for symptoms of TD at every appointment with the patient \n\nDiagnosing tardive dyskinesia early is very important. Sometimes, if the drug that is causing TD is stopped early enough, the tardive dyskinesia will go away. This is more likely to happen if the TD is diagnosed soon after its symptoms start. \n\nSometimes, even if the medication is stopped, the tardive dyskinesia never goes away. \n\nIf a person with TD still needs antipsychotic medicines, a medication called clozapine (Clozaril) is the best choice.

{"title": "Substance abuse", "parsed_text": "Substance abuse, or drug abuse, happens when a person uses a drug over and over again, in ways that hurt their health. The person is using the drug to change their mood or to feel better, not for any healthy reason. Sometimes when the person uses the drug for a long time, they will start to act differently. Some of the drugs are illegal to have or use, or can have certain limits that the person does not follow. Someone who thinks that they need a drug is called an addict. \n\nSubstance abuse can have different symptoms in different people. \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is not used in the DSM or ICD. In the DSM, the term \u201csubstance abuse\u201d is used instead to mean the misuse of one of ten different types of drugs. \u00a0A person can also become dependent on drugs. Repetitive use of a drug can cause dependence as well as tolerance. Tolerance happens when it takes more of a drug to produce the same effect than a previous time. \n\nThe term \u201cdrug misuse\u201d is sometimes used when the drug being used is a prescription medication that are classified as sedatives (medicines that make someone calm), anxiolytics (medicines that make someone less worried or anxious), analgesics (medicines that reduce pain), or stimulants (medicines that give someone more energy). Someone who abuses there drugs may have to illegally buy them from someone who gets them from a doctor. \n\nNot everyone agrees on the definition of substance abuse. Different countries have different rules for what is a drug and what drugs are illegal. People also do not agree about what is abuse. In most Western countries, one glass of wine is acceptable, but drinking more than one bottle at once is abuse. To some people, any drinking can be seen as abuse. In the United States, any use of marijuana \n\nIn many cases, when a person is using drugs, their thinking and behaviors change. Sometimes, they commit crimes while using drugs. They may do things that are not safe, like drive a car while drunk. When people abuse drugs over a longer time, their personalities often change as well. The people who abuse drugs are often addicted. Since many of these drugs are illegal, very often drug users have problems with the law. \n\nThere are two major ideas about why people abuse drugs. Many people believe that both can be true for different cases or with different people, which is one reason why different treatments work better or worse for different people. \n\nOne idea about why people use drugs is because of their genes. When a person's parents or grandparents have been addicted to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes or even coffee, the same genes that made them become addicted could be passed down to any of their children. When someone is born with the genes that increase addiction, it causes their brain and body to become dependent on drugs very quickly. But even if a person's genes make it easier for them to become addicted to drugs, that person still need to try a drug first, before they can become addicted on it. This idea also means that different people can have harder or easier time stopping drugs after they are already addicted. \n\nThe second major idea is that drug use is a habit that becomes harmful. It is always very hard to stop bad habits, but in this idea, drugs are one of the strongest bad habits because drugs cause so many changes in the brain. Each time a person uses drugs, the parts of the brain that think about drugs become stronger and stronger. In this idea, if a person likes drugs, that person starts to plan their day around using drugs. To stop a habit as strong as drug use, many other things about that person's life must also change. This idea also means that, the longer a person takes drugs, the harder it is for them to stop taking drugs. \n\nPeople abuse drugs in many different ways, including: \n\nTaking illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine) \n\nUsing legal medicines to feel good, not for what they are supposed to treat (for example, taking oxycodone to feel very good, not as a painkiller) \n\nTaking too much of a drug on purpose (for example, taking more than a normal amount of oxycodone because it will make the euphoria from the drug even better) \n\nSome of the most commonly abused illegal drugs are: \n\nCocaine, including crack cocaine \n\nHeroin \n\nMarijuana \n\nMDMA (also called Ecstasy or Molly) \n\nMethamphetamine (also called meth), including crystal methamphetamine \n\nSynthetic cannabinoids (a man-made drug that includes the main chemical in marijuana; also called K2 or Spice) \n\nSome of the most commonly abused legal drugs and medicines are: \n\nAlcohol \n\nNicotine (the drug in cigarettes) \n\nOver-the-counter cough and cold medicines that include dextrometorphan (DMX) \n\nPrescription opioids (strong painkillers), like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone \n\nPrescription sedatives (drugs that make people feel relaxed or sleepy), like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and sleep medicines \n\nPrescription stimulants (drugs that make people feel more awake and have more energy), like medicines used for ADHD \n\nPeople who abuse drugs have a high rate of suicide. This is because of the changes in the brain caused by drugs, both when they are being used and the changes they cause over time. Another cause is the loss of family and friends because of the drug abuse. In the United States, about 30% of all people who perform suicide have abused alcohol at some point. \n\nThis table explains more about how some commonly abused drugs relate to depression and suicide: \n\nSubstance abused \n\nEffects related to suicide \n\nAlcohol \n\nPeople who misuse alcohol are more likely to have a number of mental health disorders. Alcoholics have a very high suicide rate. Suicide from alcoholism is more common in older adults. If a person drinks 6 or more drinks per day, they are six times more likely to commit suicide. Many heavy drinkers have major depressive disorder, and heavy drinking itself can cause major depressive disorder in a lot of alcoholics. \n\nBenzodiazepines \n\nPeople are more likely to be depressed, and have a higher risk of suicide, if they have been abusing benzodiazepines (like Xanax) or using them for a long time. Depressed adolescents who were taking benzodiazepines were much more likely to hurt themselves or kill themselves. \n\nCigarette smoking \n\nMany studies have shown a link between smoking, thinking about suicide, and suicide attempts. In studies done with 50,000 nurses and 300,000 male U.S. Army soldiers, the people who smoked between 1 to 24 cigarettes per day had twice the suicide risk, and people who smoked 25 cigarettes or more had 4 times the suicide risk, as compared with those who had never smoked. \n\nCocaine \n\nMisuse of drugs such as cocaine often has a link with suicide. When cocaine's effects wear off, people go through cocaine withdrawal. During this time, many people feel very bad. Suicide is most likely to happen during this time in people who use a lot of cocaine or are addicted. In younger adults, suicide more commonly happens when two or more drugs are taken together. \n\nCrystal meth \n\nCrystal meth use has a strong link with depression and suicide, as well as a range of other bad effects on physical and mental health. \n\nHeroin \n\n3% to 35% of deaths among heroin users are thought to be from suicide. Overall, heroin users are 14 times more likely than people who do not use heroin to die from suicide. \n\nTreatment of substance abuse can include both therapy and medicine. Therapy for substance abuse helps people not use drugs when they feel they need to. For children and young adults, both the child and the family may have therapy. The child will learn how to not abuse, and the family will learn how to help the child. The organization Alcoholics Anonymous helps people with alcohol abuse. \n\nFor some kinds of substance abuse, medicine can be used to help. Some of these medicines, such as methadone, stop the drug from working in the brain. Other medicines can cause people to feel ill if they use the substance that they abuse. Some medicines, like bupropion, makes people stop wanting the drug so much. \n\nMany substances can cause withdrawal. Withdrawal is group of bad feelings that happen when someone stops taking a drug suddenly, if they were regularly taking that drug before. For someone to have withdrawal, they must be dependent on the drug. Different drugs cause different things to happen during withdrawal. They can also cause different amounts of trouble for the person in withdrawal. Withdrawal for some drugs, like heroin and other opiates, can be dangerous or deadly, and should be done with a doctor or nurse taking care of the person in withdrawal. \n\nAbout 9% of Americans have a substance abuse issue. Young people are the most likely to experiment with and abuse drugs. Drug abuse affects about 5% of adolescents. More men than women have substance abuse disorder, though women are more likely to have an issue with abusing prescription medication. Children who have parents with substance abuse issues are more likely to have a substance abuse issue when they grow up. \n\nCertain groups of people are more likely to develop substance abuse issues. One group is immigrants or other people who have left their home country. They often have issues in their new country, and some use drugs as a way to feel better. \u00a0Another group that is at risk is homeless children. They will use drugs to become closer to each other. A third group that is at risk is musicians. They may use stimulants to make themselves more active and happy. Singers can also hurt themselves if they use drugs that are inhaled. \n\nThe first official definition for substance abuse was made in 1932 by the American Psychiatric Association. This definition was only used for when the substance was illegal and not being used as medicine. In 1966, the American Medical Association defined abuse as the drug being given by someone to themselves without a doctor. \n\nThe first edition of the Diagnos tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) had drug abuse as a symptom of other psychological issues. In the third edition, substance abuse was made its own issue. The DSM also has drug abuse as a different issue than drug dependence, which is defined as compulsive use of a drug. \n\nMost countries have laws that make having or using certain drugs illegal. The rules for these drugs can be different between countries or in different parts of the same country. Many drugs that are illegal in several places are sold to make money for groups known as drug cartels. \n\nDrug abuse can also cause issues in a country\u2019s economy. According to the European Union, about 2.5 billion dollars are lost each year because of people abusing drugs. This loss comes from people not going to work or having to go to the hospital because of side effects of the drug. In the United Kingdom, about 29 billion dollars a year are lost. This number does not include the cost of police or other law enforcement. In the United States, the cost was 181 billion dollars in 2002. This number includes costs because of health issues, loss of work, law enforcement, and welfare programs. \n\nAddiction \n\nAlcoholism \n\nCAGE questionnaire (used to test adults for alcoholism) \n\nCRAFFT Screening Test (used to test teenagers for alcohol and drug problems) \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-06T23:56:50Z", "text_length": 14341}

It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions. \n\nPeople may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic. \n\nThere are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity. \n\nThe main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur. \n\nThought disorder \n\nLogorrhea (psychology) \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-01-23T18:53:43Z", "text_length": 2518}

{"title": "Combat stress reaction", "parsed_text": "Combat stress reaction is a medical problem that happens to some soldiers because of the trauma of war. In the past, it was called battle shock, war neurosis, or battle fatigue. It causes both mental and physical problems. It is similar to acute stress disorder, and can often become post-traumatic stress disorder. \n\nCombat stress reaction does not affect everyone equally. Sometimes it causes soldiers to be very unhappy. Sometimes it causes soldiers severe disability. \n\nThe acute (early) stage of combat stress reaction is the best time to keep things from getting worse. Since World War I, soldiers in early stages of combat stress reaction have usually been treated on the front lines - close to where combat is happening. \n\nCombat stress reaction can have many different symptoms. These symptoms can affect the soldier's body (physical symptoms), feelings (emotional symptoms), and behaviors (behavioral symptoms). Depending on how bad these symptoms are, combat stress reactions are labeled from mild (not too bad) to severe (very bad). \n\nMild physical symptoms may include: \n\nFeeling tired \n\nFeeling jumpy \n\nSweating \n\nHaving trouble sleeping \n\nFast heartbeat \n\nFeeling dizzy \n\nFeeling nauseous or throwing up \n\nHaving diarrhea \n\nUrinating a lot \n\nNot reacting as quickly as usual to things \n\nDry mouth \n\nTight muscles \n\nThese symptoms may not cause safety problems, or keep the soldier from working. However, if the soldier does not get help, the symptoms can become severe. \n\nSevere symptoms may include: \n\nBeing unable to sit or stand still \n\nBeing startled very easily \n\nShaking or trembling \n\nWeakness \n\nParalysis \n\nTrouble hearing \n\nFeeling exhausted \n\nBeing unable to move \n\nStaring straight ahead without looking at anything (this is sometimes called \" the thousand-yard stare \" ) \n\nPalpitations (pounding heart) \n\nHyperventilation (breathing too fast) \n\nFeeling unable to speak \n\nBeing unable to sleep \n\nEmotional symptoms may include: \n\nFeeling anxious \n\nHaving trouble concentrating or focusing on something \n\nHaving nightmares \n\nNot feeling confident \n\nFeeling angry \n\nFeeling stressed or very upset over small things \n\nBehavioral symptoms may include: \n\nNot being able to make decisions \n\nNot paying attention well \n\nNot caring about things \n\nBeing very alert \n\nNot feeling motivated (not wanting to do anything) \n\nAggressive behavior \n\nCrying \n\nBeing unable to relax \n\nSigmund Freud studied the effects of \" war neurosis. \" He believed that without too much stress, people can balance impulses (what they want to do) and prohibitions (what they know they should not do). However, he thought that traumatic stress can cause powerful impulses that a person can no longer control. In combat situations, he thought this could cause soldiers to run away, or to blindly attack. He believed that soldiers would try to stop these impulses, which would lead to emotional symptoms and even loss of physical abilities. \n\nDuring World War I, combat stress reaction was called \" shell shock. \" By early 1916 (just halfway through the war), the number of British soldiers with \" shell shock \" was huge. Few of these soldiers returned to battle. About 30-40% of shell-shocked soldiers sent to hospitals in France returned to battle. Only about 4-5% of soldiers sent to hospitals in the United Kingdom returned. \n\nBecause of this, new units were created. They were called \" Not Yet Diagnosed, Nervous Centers. \" These centers did not use terms like \" war neurosis \" or \" shell shock. \" They used a new treatment model called \" PIE \" to treat soldiers with combat stress reaction. \" PIE \" stood for \" Proximity, Immediacy, and Expectancy \" : \n\nProximity meant that soldiers with combat stress reaction should be treated close to the front line (close to where combat was happening). \n\nImmediacy meant that these soldiers should be treated right away - not just after soldiers who were physically hurt were treated. \n\nExpectancy meant that each soldier knew he was expected to return to combat. \n\nThe PIE treatment model was developed by Thomas W. Salmon. After \" PIE \" treatment was started, about 80% of soldiers treated at the \" Not Yet Diagnosed, Nervous Centers \" returned to combat. (However, some of these soldiers were not able to do a good job when they returned to combat.) \n\nBritish forces did not use the PIE principles during World War II. Instead, they sent soldiers with combat stress reaction to psychiatric hospitals. \n\nThe United States military did not expect their soldiers to have combat stress reactions when they entered the war. They tested soldiers when they were enlisting (being signed up for military duty). They believed that this testing would show which people were 'psychologically weak,' and that these people would not be allowed to go to war. However, because combat stress reaction is not caused by weakness, this did not work, and many American soldiers had combat stress reactions. \n\nTo treat these soldiers, Captain Frederick Hanson began to use the PIE principles again. He said that 70% of the 494 patients he treated returned to duty after 48 hours of PIE treatment. General Omar Bradley decided to call combat stress reaction \" exhaustion \" and also decided to give \" exhausted \" soldiers seven days of rest. \n\nThe main goal of PIE was to return \" exhausted \" soldiers to combat, not to treat the trauma causing the disorder. Because of this, many of the soldiers who returned to duty - possibly as many as 70% - returned in non-combat positions. \n\nDuring the Korean War, the United States started using the PIE principles within the first 8 weeks of the war. Reports show that 65-75% of soldiers with combat stress reactions returned to duty. However, only 44% were able to do their jobs at an average level or better. \n\nAt the start of the Vietnam War, the United States military had effective psychiatric services in place within 8 weeks of the start of the war. Treatments were based on the PIE principles. Special mobile psychiatric units - soldiers who could give PIE treatment in different places - were created. \n\nDuring the war, not many cases of combat stress reaction were reported. Because of this, many people thought that combat stress reactions would no longer play a large part in warfare. \n\nHowever, after soldiers returned home, many had problems with combat stress reaction. Alienation lead to substance abuse, which hid combat stress reactions that had never been treated. If the rates of post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam veterans are correct, the PIE principles did not prevent an epidemic of psychiatric disorders. \n\nThe United States military went into this war expecting high numbers of psychological causalities. The treatment included traditional psychiatry, as well as attention to family issues. Because this war moved so fast, diagnosing soldiers with combat stress reaction was difficult. \n\nSome commanders used combat stress reaction as an excuse to keep soldiers from returning or kick them out of the military. This eventually added to the stigma attached to mental health problems in the military. \n\nToday, the United States Army uses the acronym BICEPS, which stands for brevity, immediacy, contact, expectancy, proximity, and simplicity: \n\nBrevity is a short period of rest. Many soldiers return to duty after this brief rest. More seriously affected patients are referred to the next level. \n\nImmediacy means that treatment should start as soon as symptoms appear. \n\nContact means that the soldier should be able to see members of his or her unit while getting treatment. This can help the soldier keep feeling like a soldier and a member of the unit, instead of feeling like a patient. \n\nExpectancy means soldiers should be told their reaction to stress is normal, and that they are expected back with their unit. \n\nProximity (closeness) means that soldiers should be treated close to their unit, but away from patients who are physically hurt (unless nothing else is possible). \n\nSimplicity means treatment should involve simple ways of improving soldiers' self-confidence and physical health. \n\nToday's treatment also includes the \" 5 R's \" : \n\nReassure normality (reassure soldiers that their reactions to stress are normal) \n\nRest \n\nReplenish bodily needs (make sure soldiers' bodies are getting what they need, like enough food and drink) \n\nRestore confidence \n\nRetain (keep) contact with fellow soldiers and unit \n\nToday, soldiers are treated for their response to combat stress, not like they have emotional problems. \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-08-30T23:30:01Z", "text_length": 10324}

Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope. The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test. \n\nLeishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania and the type of infection. Medications used for the visceral form include: liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For the cutaneous form, paromomycin, fluconazole or pentamidine can help. \n\nAs of 2014, about 12 million people are infected in some 98 countries. There are about 2 million new cases each year. Each year, between 20 thousand and 50 thousand people die from the disease. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease. \n\nThe parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals: The disease has been described in dogs, cats, rodents, cattle and horses. In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting. \n\nLeishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. These can transmit the infection Leishmania. The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1). Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3). Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which Leishmania species is involved (4). The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6). In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8). \n\nThe genomes of three Leishmania species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. Leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-29T12:23:00Z", "text_length": 3936}

In medicine, a person who is having status epilepticus is described as being \" in status. \" \n\nDefinitions of status epilepticus have changed over time. It used to be that a seizure had to last 20 or 30 minutes to be thought of as status epilepticus. (Most normal seizures last only one to two minutes.) \n\nToday, a person is usually described as being \" in status \" when: \n\nThey have a seizure that lasts more than five minutes; OR \n\nThey have more than one seizure without recovering in between. \n\n\" Recovering \" means that the person wakes up and knows who they are; where they are; and what day, month, or year it is. \n\nStatus epilepticus is very dangerous. About 10 - 20 % of the people who go into this status die from it. \n\nStatus Epilepticus is considered a medical emergency for many reasons: \n\nDuring a long seizure, it is very hard for the body to get oxygen to the brain and the heart. \n\nWithout enough oxygen, the brain cannot survive. Not having enough oxygen can cause brain damage and death. \n\nWhen the heart does not get enough oxygen, it can start to beat in ways that are not normal. If the heart goes without enough oxygen for long enough, it can stop beating. \n\nStatus can cause very high body temperatures (hyperthermia), which can damage the brain. \n\nStatus can cause pulmonary edema - fluid in the lungs - which makes it hard or impossible to breathe. This makes it even harder for oxygen to get to the brain, heart, and the rest of the body. \n\nThe nerves in the brain can get damaged by the extra electricity in the brain that happens during long seizures. \n\nIf people in status get the right treatment quickly, they can survive with little or no brain damage. \n\nOnly about one in four people who go into status epilepticus have epilepsy. The other three out of four people who go into status have never had a seizure before. Status epilepticus can happen for many other reasons. \n\nMany different illnesses can cause status epilepticus: \n\nIn children, the most common cause of status is an infection with a fever \n\nBrain infection \n\nBrain tumor \n\nStroke \n\nHypoxia (not getting enough oxygen, especially to the brain) \n\nGastroenteritis (a special form of diarrhea) while taking anticonvulsants \n\nProblems with metabolism (the way the body makes energy from food), like problems with the liver or kidneys \n\nVery bad injuries can also cause status: \n\nInjury to the head or brain \n\nHemorrhage (very bad bleeding) \n\nIllegal drugs, alcohol, and some medications can cause status: \n\nIllegal drugs \n\nWhen a person stops taking certain illegal drugs suddenly \n\nBad reactions to some medicines, like some antidepressants \n\nWhen a patient does not take enough of certain medicines, or stops taking them suddenly \n\nDrinking too much alcohol \n\nWhen a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking (alcohol withdrawal), especially if the person gets delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal \n\nExposure to nerve gas \n\nPeople in status epilepticus are unable to end their seizures on their own.

{"title": "Lassa fever", "parsed_text": "Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is a fever caused by the Lassa virus. It is common in West Africa. One in 80 people who get Lassa fever will die. Some cases are severe and require going to a hospital. These cases have a death rate of 1 in 5. Lassa Fever was discovered in 1969 after two nurses died from the disease. It was named for the town in Borno State, Nigeria where it was first diagnosed. \n\nLassa fever is transmitted from rodents to humans. It is caused by direct contact with rodent droppings. It can also be transmitted by humans to other humans by their blood. Lassa fever is common in West and Central Africa (around the equator). \n\nLassa fever cannot be transmitted by breathing. It is not very contagious between humans. However it is much more contagious among seriously ill patients. Lassa fever is transmitted by humans through skin lesions, mucous that is exposed to the virus, or by a patient's blood. This means healthcare workers (such as doctors and nurses) need to be especially careful in treating patients, or they risk getting the virus themselves. \n\nIn 80% of cases, the disease does not have any symptoms and does not make people ill. In the other 20% of cases it shows symptoms and becomes much more severe. About 5,000 people die from it each year. \n\nIn infected patients, the disease has an incubation period of 5 days to 3 weeks. During this time, the virus remains dormant and does not cause harm. After this time various symptoms begin to appear including: \n\nVomiting (with blood) \n\nDiarrhea (with blood) \n\nNausea \n\nStomach ache \n\nConstipation \n\nDifficulty Swallowing \n\nCoughing \n\nSeizures \n\nIn laboratories, there are many ways to test if a patient has Lassa fever. However, in many of the affected regions, there is no equipment to do the tests. This means sometimes people may not be correctly tested and identified with having Lassa fever. \n\nIf a patient is diagnosed with Lassa fever, then the patient will be kept away from other people, to prevent the spread of the virus. If found early, it is possible to treat Lassa fever with the medicine Ribavirin. Despite the fact the drug is relatively cheap, the medicine is still considered expensive for many people in affected regions. Patients may also require blood transfusions and rehydration. \n\nPregnant women in their 3rd trimester may need their baby's birth to be induced to allow them to stand a chance of survival. \n\nDue to the use of Ribavirin, fewer people are dying from Lassa fever. \n\nIt is not practical to control the amount of rodents in the affected states. Therefore the best way of prevention is to keep rodents out of houses and public areas to prevent people coming into contact with infected droppings. Infected patients should also be isolated to prevent the spread of the virus (by humans to other humans). In rich countries, diseases such as Lassa fever can be easily monitored by public health organisations to prevent outbreaks. Poor countries often cannot afford these services \n\nThere is a vaccine which has shown promise in primates.

{"title": "Hyperthermia", "parsed_text": "Hyperthermia is a high body temperature. It happens when a person is not able to control their body temperature. This can happen for many reasons, like very hot weather, fever, and some medicines or illegal drugs. \n\nDoctors define hyperthermia as a body temperature that is over 101 degrees Fahrenheit. (The average human body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.) When a person gets hyperthermia, they can have heat-related injuries, where the high body temperature hurts the body. \n\nThere are three forms of heat-related injuries caused by hyperthermia: heat cramps (the least serious), heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (the most serious). \n\nAll types of hyperthermia can be caused by the same things. Some common causes are: \n\nWeather: Weather that is very hot, sunny, and humid \n\nActivity: Exercising or working a lot, especially if it is hot out \n\nOlder people and infants can get hyperthermia even if they are resting inside, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air. This can happen because very old and very young people have trouble controlling their body temperatures. \n\nIllegal drugs, especially ecstasy and amphetamines, can make the body's temperature get very hot, very quickly \n\nOther things that make a person more likely to get hyperthermia, especially if they are exercising or working, include: \n\nClothing: Wearing dark clothing, hats or helmets, or padded clothing (like football pads) \n\nBody weight: Having more body fat makes it harder for the body to cool down \n\nDehydration (not having enough fluids in the body): This makes it harder for the body to cool itself down by sweating \n\nFever: Because the body's temperature is already higher than normal \n\nMedicines: Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines \n\nHeat cramps are the least serious form of hyperthermia. (A \" cramp \" is a sharp pain caused by a muscle getting tighter and shorter.) \n\nThe major symptoms of heat cramps are: \n\nPainful cramps, usually in the legs or abdomen \n\nSweating a lot, which can cause dehydration and loss of electrolytes (important salts that the body needs) \n\nPeople with heat cramps usually do not need medical treatment. The best treatments for heat cramps are: \n\nMoving to a cool place and resting \n\nResting the muscles that hurt \n\nDrinking water or sports drinks to treat dehydration \n\nHeat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps. If affects the whole body instead of just certain muscles, like heat cramps. \n\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion may include: \n\nSyncope (fainting) or dizziness \n\nLow blood pressure \n\nMore serious dehydration \n\nThe person may be (this means they get dizzy or faint when they stand up; it is a sign of dehydration) \n\nFeeling very thirsty with a dry mouth \n\nCool, clammy skin (because the body is trying as hard as it can to pull heat out of the body by sweating) \n\nNausea or vomiting (because of dehydration) \n\nPeople with heat exhaustion may need medical treatment. \n\nFirst aid for people with heat exhaustion includes: \n\nMoving the person to a cool place \n\nHaving the patient take off extra layers of clothes \n\nCooling the patient down by fanning them and putting wet towels on their body \n\nHaving them lie down and put their feet up if they are feeling dizzy \n\nHaving them drink water or sports drinks - but only if they are awake, not confused, and not vomiting \n\nTurning the person on their side if they are vomiting \n\nIf a person with heat exhaustion gets medical treatment, EMTs or doctors may: \n\nGive them oxygen \n\nGive them water and electrolytes intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein) if they are too confused to drink, or are vomiting \n\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency. If it is not treated quickly enough, it causes brain damage and death. It is one of the most common causes of death in sports that can be prevented. \n\nHeat stroke happens when a person gets so hot that their body cannot do anything to bring their temperature down. The body has tried every strategy it has to cool itself down. But the body is so hot that none of those strategies work any more. This causes the body temperature to rise very quickly. The body gets so hot inside that its tissues, especially the brain, get damaged. Usually, people with heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. The brain cannot survive for long at these temperatures. Heat stroke can very quickly cause damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and muscles. \n\nOften, the first signs of heat stroke are: \n\nAgitation (the person gets upset and restless) \n\nConfusion \n\nA strong, fast heart rate \n\nAs heat stroke gets worse, symptoms that can kill the person start to appear. For example: \n\nSeizures, especially status epilepticus \n\nVery low blood pressure (too low to get blood and oxygen to the brain) \n\nA weak, slow heart rate (this is a sign that the heart cannot beat strongly enough to get blood and oxygen to the body) \n\nDelirium or coma (caused by the brain getting so hot that it cannot work, and not getting enough oxygen) \n\nThe patient's skin will also be flushed (red), hot, and dry (because the body is no longer able to cool itself by sweating) \n\nPeople with heat stroke always need emergency medical treatment as soon as possible. If a person might have heat stroke, 9-1-1 or another emergency telephone number should be called right away. The emergency medical dispatcher can explain what to do to help the person until an ambulance gets there. \n\nOnce the person with heat stroke gets to an ambulance or a hospital, treatments for heat stroke may include: \n\nCooling the person down as fast as possible. Ways to do this include: \n\nTaking the person's clothes off \n\nCovering the person with wet towels \n\nTurning up the air conditioning or turning on a fan, if possible \n\nPutting ice packs in the person's armpits, on the back of their neck, and in their groin \n\nPutting the person into an ice bath \n\nGiving cold intravenous fluids, both to help cool the person down and to help with dehydration \n\nGiving benzodiazepines to stop shivering from being cooled down so quickly (shivering makes the body even warmer) \n\nGiving medicines to stop seizures \n\nGiving medicines to help heart problems caused by the heat stroke \n\nGiving oxygen, or putting a tube down the person's throat to help them breathe (this is called ) \n\nThe prognosis for people with heat stroke depends on how high their body temperature got, how quickly their body temperature increased, and how quickly they got treatment. \n\nUp to 80% of people who do not get treatment for heat stroke right away die. But cooling people with heat stroke down right away, and getting them treatment very quickly, can change this so that only 10% die. But some people who survive have brain damage or other health problems caused by their heat stroke. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-06-24T15:05:40Z", "text_length": 7682}

Carbuncle <nowiki/> s are an abscess in the hair follicles. \n\nAn abscess is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria can be part of a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is proved by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection. \n\nTreatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is to cut it open and drain out the pus. Antibiotics are usually not needed for healthy people. New studies have found that it is better to close the wound after draining, instead of packing it with gauze. This can speed healing and not increase risk of the abscess returning. Sometimes simply sucking out the pus with a needle is not enough. \n\nSkin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. As many as 65% of people who take intravenous drugs get abscesses In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were put in hospital in 2008 for the disease. \n\nAbscesses can form in any kind of solid tissue. They are usually on the skin surface (such as a boils, or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys and tonsils. The condition can become more complicated if the pus and the infection spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to gangrene, where areas of body tissue die. \n\nThe main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills. \n\nInternal abscesses are more difficult to find. The abscess can be painful, and a person will have a high temperature, and generally feel unwell. \n\nInternal abscesses do not usually heal without medical treatment. In some cases an abscess could even cause death, for example where an abscess in the neck put pressure on the trachea. \n\nIf abscess is on the surface, it may be \" fluctuant \" , that is it feels like it is full of fluid, when touched.

A woman with PID can have a fever, pain when the belly is touched, lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, painful sex, or unusual bleeding. \n\n</ref> \n\nThe infection is caused by microorganisms that enter the body through the vagina during sex. The microorganisms travel up thorough uterus and into the inside of the body. There are many microorganisms that cause infection in this way, such as: \n\nGonorrhea \n\nChlamydia \n\nSome mycoplasmas \n\nMedical workers use different tests to find the infection. They can perform a medical exam to see evidence of pus and find painful areas. They can use a microscope to see the microorganisms causing the infection. A blood test can detect PID. Two thirds of women were not aware they had PID. Even with no signs of infection, PID can cause serious harm. \n\nOther causes can produce signs to PID symptoms including: appendicitis, a complicated pregnancy, swollen or twisted ovaries and endometriosis. \n\n</ref> A woman is more likely to get Pelvic inflammatory disease if she has had it before. She is more likely to have the infection if she has recently had sex, started menstruation, had an Intrauterine device put inside her uterus or if her sex partner has a sexually transmitted infection. \n\n</ref> \n\nMedical testing for sexually transmitted infections is important for prevention. The risk of getting PID can be lowered by: \n\nUsing condoms \n\nSeeking medical help if you are experiencing symptoms of PID. \n\nSeeking medical help after learning that your sex partner or someone you had sex with in the past had a sexually transmitted infection. \n\nSeeking medical exams regularly to test for PID with no symptoms. \n\nAsking your current sex partner if they have an infection. Insist they be tested and cured before sex. \n\nAvoiding sex after delivery, miscarriage, or abortion. \n\nPracticing abstinence \n\n</ref> \n\nIf your medical provider thinks you are infected, treatment is usually started right away. This is because serious results may happen from delayed treatment. Sometimes the medical provider will use a test to help find the infection. Curing the infection with antibiotic medications is normal. Improvement should occur quickly but if not, the woman is told to find more medical attention. Treating sex partners for possible infections will help in treatment and prevention of getting the infection again. \n\nAbout 106 million cases of PID occurred around the world in 2008. About 1.5% of young women yearly get the infection. One million women in the United States get PID every year. \n\nAlthough the PID infection may be cured the damage from the infection may not go away. \n\n</ref> This makes finding the infection early so important.

If the lung is cut, then the injury is instead a pulmonary laceration and has different symptoms. \n\nA lung contusion is usually caused by blunt trauma. Explosion injuries or a shock wave from a penetrating trauma may also cause this injury. \n\nDoctors began studying this injury after explosives hurt soldiers in World Wars I and II. In the 1960s when cars became popular people began to get this kind of injury from car accident <nowiki/> s.\u00a0 \n\nLung contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung. In contusion, the structure of the lung does not change. In laceration, the pieces of lung may be moved. When blood fills lacerations, the injury is called pulmonary hematoma. The difference between a contusion and a hematoma is that in a contusion, the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs that give oxygen) will bleed, but a hematoma is a blood clot. \n\nIf the\u00a0pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax) then this is called a collapsed lung. These conditions do not always damage the lung but they might, or they might be the result of damage. Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may happen with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest. In flail chest multiple ribs are broken move independently of the rib cage. \n\nPulmonary contusion is the most common injury found in blunt chest trauma, occurring in 25\u201335% of cases. It is usually caused by a collision while moving quickly. About 70% of cases result from motor vehicle collisions, most often when the chest strikes the inside of the car. Falls, assaults, and sports injuries are other causes. Pulmonary contusion can also be caused by explosions. The organs most harmed by blast injuries are those that hold gas, such as the lungs. Blast lung is severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding, or edema with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. This is the usual cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion. Unlike other causes of injury in which pulmonary contusion is often found with other injuries, explosions can cause pulmonary contusion without damage to the chest wall. \n\n", "timestamp": "2016-06-30T05:28:24Z", "text_length": 3150}

{"title": "Pulmonary edema", "parsed_text": "Pulmonary edema (pulmonary oedema in British English) is fluid in the lungs ( \" Pulmonary \" means \" lungs \" ; \" edema \" means \" swelling \" or \" fluid \" ). Normally, the lungs fill with air when a person breathes in. From the alveoli in the lungs, oxygen goes into the blood. The blood then carries oxygen to the entire body. Every part of the body needs oxygen to survive. \n\nWhen a person has fluid in their lungs (pulmonary edema), there is not enough space left for air to get into the lungs. The person will not be able to breathe in as much air. This means not as much oxygen will get into the blood, and the body will not get the oxygen it needs. \n\nThe most common cause of pulmonary edema is heart failure on the left side of the heart. The left side of the heart is supposed to pump blood to the entire body. If the left side of the heart is too weak to do this, blood will back up into the lungs. This is called cardiogenic pulmonary edema. ( \" Cardiogenic \" means \" caused by the heart. \" ) \n\nOther, non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema include: \n\nFluid overload: When a person with kidney failure eats too much salt or drinks too much fluid. Because the kidneys cannot filter out fluids like they normally do, the fluid backs up into the lungs. \n\nSmoke inhalation \n\nDrowning in salt water \n\nHigh-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), which happens when people are at very high altitudes, like climbing mountains \n\nHypothermia (a very low body temperature) \n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, caused by some kind of lung illness (like pneumonia or sepsis) or injury (like smoke inhalation) \n\nPulmonary embolism, where a blood clot from one part of the body travels to the lungs \n\nInjury to the chest or lungs \n\nInfections caused by viruses, like dengue fever \n\nBad reactions to drugs, including illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine, and legal medicines like aspirin \n\nSymptoms of pulmonary edema may include: \n\nDifficulty breathing \n\nOrthopnea (breathing is hardest when lying down) \n\nParoxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (this means that difficulty breathing may wake the person up when they are sleeping at night) \n\nPink, frothy sputum \n\nA medical professional will hear rales when they listen to breath sounds with a stethoscope \n\nFlash pulmonary edema is a medical emergency. It is pulmonary edema that comes on very quickly. Usually pulmonary edema takes a few hours to develop. But in the worst cases of flash pulmonary edema, a person's lungs can fill completely with fluid in minutes. Flash pulmonary edema can also be caused by moving a person with pulmonary edema, or lying them down. \n\nNo matter what the cause is, pulmonary edema can be treated by: \n\nGiving the person oxygen \n\nSitting the person straight up (this makes it easier to breathe) \n\nForcing air into the person's lungs (this is called ventilation) if needed \n\nDiuretic medicines, which remove extra fluid from the body \n\nMedicines like nitroglycerine ( \" nitro \" ), which reduce the pressure caused by fluid going into the lungs. Nitroglycerine can also make the blood vessels in the lungs wider, so more fluid fits into them; this can free up some extra space for air to get into the lungs. \n\nOther treatments can focus on the cause of the pulmonary edema. For example, if a person with kidney failure has had too much salt or fluid, they can have dialysis to take away the extra fluid and salt. \n\n", "timestamp": "2016-01-12T03:05:59Z", "text_length": 3671}

It is degenerative (it gets worse over time); it cannot be cured, and it always causes death. \n\n</ref> CJD is sometimes called a human form of \" mad cow disease \" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE). BSE is actually a cause of one rare type of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease; the two are not the same disease. \n\nCJD is caused by an infectious agent called a prion. Prions are proteins that are folded wrong. Prions make copies of themselves by changing correctly folded proteins into misfolded shapes. CJD causes brain tissue to become unhealthy very quickly. As the disease destroys the brain, the brain develops holes. The brain's texture changes and becomes like a kitchen sponge. \n\nTypes of CJD include: \n\nvariant (vCJD): \n\n:This type of CJD may be caused by eating food that has prions in it, like meat from cows that have BSE ( \" mad cow disease \" ). However, this is a very uncommon cause of CJD. \n\nsporadic (sCJD): \n\n:This is the most common type of CJD. 85% of cases of CJD are sporadic CJD. Nobody knows what causes sCJD; it seems to happen randomly. \n\nfamilial (fCJD): \n\n:Most of the other 15% of cases of CJD are familial CJD. This is a form of CJD runs in families. \n\niatrogenic: \n\n:This form of CJD is usually caused by a medical procedure where a person gets blood or tissue from someone with CJD. For example, if a person can get iatrogenic CJD if they get a blood transfusion or a cornea transplant from someone who has CJD. \n\nThe first symptom of CJD is dementia, which gets worse very quickly. dementia causes memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations. \n\nOther common mental symptoms include: \n\nAnxiety \n\nDepression \n\nParanoia \n\nObsessive-compulsive symptoms \n\nPsychosis \n\nPhysical symptoms of CJD often include: \n\nTrouble speaking \n\nJerky movements (myoclonus) \n\nTrouble with balance (ataxia) \n\nTrouble walking \n\nShaking or being stiff \n\nVision problems \n\nTrouble swallowing, which can make eating difficult or impossible \n\nTrouble coughing, which can cause pneumonia \n\nMovements that the patient cannot control (dyskinesia) \n\nMost people with CJD die within six months after their first symptoms appeared. Often, they die of pneumonia caused by trouble coughing. About 15% of patients survive for two or more years. Some patients have lived 4\u20135 years with mostly mental symptoms until the disease gets worse and causes more physical symptoms. Once this happens, people usually die within a year. \n\nThe symptoms of CJD are caused by the death of more and more of the brain's nerve cells. When scientists look at brain tissue from a CJD patient under a microscope, they can see many tiny holes where whole areas of nerve cells have died. \n\nDoctors may suspect CJD when a person has certain symptoms. For example, dementia usually gets worse slowly. Dementia that gets worse very quickly is unusual. Along with symptoms like jerky movements, these symptoms may point to possible CJD. \n\nTests can then be done to show whether the person has CJD. These tests include: \n\nElectroencephalography (EEG): This test shows the electrical activity in the brain. A doctor will often be able to see changes in the EEG that are common in people with CJD. The type of changes that show on the EEG will depend on the type of CJD the patient has, and how far along their disease is. \n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test makes it possible to study cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), looking for a specific protein ( \" 14-3-3 protein \" ) \n\nMRI of the brain: A test that uses a very strong magnet to take pictures of the brain \n\nBiopsy: To do a biopsy, a surgeon uses a needle to take a small piece of tissue from the body, so doctors can look at it under a microscope. vCJD can be diagnosed with a biopsy of the tonsils. For all of the other types of CJD, a biopsy of the brain is the only way to tell for sure if a person has CJD. However, since a biopsy of the brain can cause brain damage, a brain biopsy is usually not done if other tests have already shown that a person probably has CJD. \n\nAs of 2016, there is no treatment that cures CJD or even slows down its effects. Many experiments are being done to try to find treatments. \n\nToday, the only treatments for CJD are medicines that treat the disease's symptoms and help patients be more comfortable. For example, patients who have seizures may be given anticonvulsant medications. Benzodiazepines can make muscle jerks happen less often. \n\nPatients may also choose to have medical procedures to help with bad symptoms. For example, CJD may cause so much trouble swallowing that a person cannot eat. Some people with CJD choose to have a feeding tube put in when they can no longer eat. This is a tube that goes into the stomach, so that special liquid can be given right into the stomach to give the person nutrition. \n\nPrion \n\nPrion disease \n\nTerminal illness \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-09-15T05:04:07Z", "text_length": 6190}
{"title": "Ventricular tachycardia", "parsed_text": "Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a type of tachycardia (a fast heart rate). The heart has four chambers (closed spaces). The top two are called the atria, and the bottom two are called the ventricles. When the heart is working normally, electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first. However, in ventricular tachycardia, the ventricles squeeze first. This happens because the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working. \n\nVentricular tachycardia is a medical emergency. First of all, if the heart is beating too fast, it does not have time to refill with blood between beats. This means that the heart will not be able to squeeze out enough blood to the rest of the body. Most people in ventricular tachycardia have a heart rate of at least 170 beats per minute. This is very fast. (A normal heart rate is 60-100.) \n\nVentricular tachycardia can also cause low blood pressure. If the blood pressure gets low enough, important parts of the body, like the brain, will not get enough blood and oxygen to survive. \n\nVentricular tachycardia can also lead to ventricular fibrillation, asystole (where the heart stops beating), and sudden death. \n\nThe most common symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are feeling dizzy, having palpitations (feeling the heart pounding inside the chest), having trouble breathing, or chest pain. Some people with ventricular tachycardia do not have any symptoms, especially if the V-tach lasts for only a few seconds. \n\nWhen a person's heart rate is very high, or the ventricular tachycardia lasts for more than a few seconds, the person may faint or become unconscious because their brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen. In the worst cases, their heart may stop, or they may die. \n\nA doctor can diagnose ventricular tachycardia by doing an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or an EKG). This is a test that shows the electrical activity in the heart. The doctor will be able to see that the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working. \n\nVentricular tachycardia can be treated in a few different ways. Treatment depends on whether the patient still has a pulse. If the patient is in pulseless ventricular tachycardia, their heart is beating so fast that it cannot squeeze out any blood. \n\nIf a person still has a pulse, ventricular tachycardia can usually be stopped through cardioversion. Cardioversion means using medication or an electric shock to make the heart start beating normally again. \n\nIf a person has pulseless ventricular tachycardia, they need to be shocked with a defibrillator. \n\nTwo different types of defibrillators can be used. An external defibrillator is a machine that delivers a shock through two sticky pads that are placed on the person's chest. \n\nHowever, some people who have already been diagnosed with V-tach have surgery to put a defibrillator inside their chest. This is called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This type of defibrillator shocks the heart automatically when it goes into V-tach. \n\nIf a person goes into pulseless ventricular tachycardia, first aid can be helpful. 9-1-1 or the local emergency telephone number should be called immediately. Then - like in any situation where a person suddenly becomes unconscious and has no pulse - cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started right away. An emergency medical dispatcher can help explain how to do CPR until an ambulance gets there. \n\nVentricular tachycardia can be caused by many different things. The most common cause is ischemic heart disease (heart disease that causes the heart to not get enough oxygen). \n\nVentricular tachycardia can also be caused by other problems, like: \n\nCardiomyopathies (diseases that affect the heart muscle) \n\nDiseases like sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis that can affect the whole body, if they attack the heart muscle \n\nProblems with electrolytes, like not having enough potassium, calcium, or magnesium \n\nIllegal drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine \n\nCertain kinds of medications \n\nSometimes doctors cannot find a cause for ventricular tachycardia. This is called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. \n\nVentricular tachycardia causes most of the sudden cardiac deaths in the United States. It causes about 300,000 deaths every year. \n\nThe chance of sudden death is highest for people who: \n\nHave ischemic cardiomyopathy (their heart muscle was damaged by not getting enough oxygen); and \n\nHave ventricular tachycardia that comes and goes \n\nThe chance of sudden death is lowest for people with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. \n\nEven for high-risk people, treatment with medications like beta blockers can help. So can implantable cardio-defibrillators. \n\nCardiac arrhythmia \n\nTachycardia \n\n", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T20:13:42Z", "text_length": 5461}
{"title": "Chikungunya", "parsed_text": "Chikungunya (pronounced \" chicken-GUN-yay \" ) is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus. It can cause joint pains that can last for weeks, months, or sometimes even years. About 1 in every 1000 people who gets chikungunya dies. People who are elderly or have other medical problems are most likely to die or get very sick from chikungunya. \n\nChikungunya is spread to humans by two species of mosquito: Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. These mosquitoes carry the infection to humans after biting monkeys, birds, cattle, or rodents who have chikungunya. Since 2004, there have been outbreaks (where many people get chikungunya) in Asia, Europe, and The Americas. \n\nThere is no known treatment or cure for chikungunya. \n\nIt can take one to twelve days for a person to get sick after they get the chikungunya virus. (This period of time is called the virus's incubation period.) Usually, people get sick in three to seven days. Most people who get the virus (72% to 97%) get symptoms. \n\nChikungunya has an acute phase, which lasts a short time, and a chronic phase, which can last weeks, months, or years. \n\nThe acute phase usually begins with a sudden high fever that can last up to ten days. The fever is usually above 39 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F), and can sometimes get as high as 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). About half of people with chikungunya get a rash, usually about two to five days after symptoms start. Some people also have gastrointestinal symptoms, like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In rare cases, people may get conjunctivitis or other problems with their eyes. \n\nThe body starts to fight the virus after about a week by sending out immunoglobulin M (IgM), which attacks the virus. After this, most of the symptoms usually start to get better. However, people often keep having some symptoms for about another week, like headache, insomnia (trouble sleeping), and exhaustion. After these symptoms end, the acute phase of chikungunya is usually over. \n\nIn chikungunya's chronic phase, almost everyone with the virus (87% - 98%) gets very bad joint pain or stiffness. This usually lasts for weeks or months. However, it can last for years. The joint pain can be so bad that a person cannot move the joints that hurt. The pain almost always happens in more than one joint. Usually, people have pain in the joints in their arms and legs, on both sides. These may include the joints in the wrists, ankles, hands, feet, shoulders, elbows, and knees. The virus can also cause pain in the muscles or ligaments. \n\nSometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between chikungunya and dengue fever. Both infections cause some of the same symptoms, like fever and very bad pain. However, chikungunya usually does not cause bleeding. If a person diagnosed with chikungunya has bleeding problems, they may: \n\nHave dengue fever instead of chikungunya \n\nHave both chikungunya and dengue fever (both are spread by mosquitoes, and are common in some of the same places) \n\nHave both chikungunya and liver problems \n\nThe best way for people to protect themselves from chikungunya is to protect themselves from mosquitoes in places where the disease is common. For example, people may use bug spray and mosquito nets, and wear long sleeves and long pants when they are outside. In places where chikungunya is common, governments can also do things to control the number of mosquitoes. For example, they can spray pesticides. \n\nThere is no vaccine for chikungunya. Scientists are doing experiments to try to make a vaccine. However, scientists say that even if they created a vaccine, people would still have to control mosquitoes to prevent chikungunya. \n\nThere is no known treatment for chikungunya. No known anti-viral medicines (medicines which kill viruses) kill the chikungunya virus. \n\nMedical professionals can only give \" supportive care. \" This means they can only treat chikungunya's symptoms. For example, they may treat fever and joint pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen; painkillers like paracetamol (acetaminophen); and fluids. Aspirin is not given because it can make bleeding more likely to happen. \n\nScientists have not found any medication that helps everyone with chikungunya who has bad joint pain. There is some evidence that certain medicines may help people who have bad joint pain for more than two weeks. These medicines include: \n\nRibavirin, an anti-viral medicine \n\nChloroquine, a medicine usually given to prevent malaria \n\nMethotrexate, a medicine used for rheumatoid arthritis, which also causes very bad joint pain \n\nThese medicines do not help the symptoms of chikungunya during the acute phase. \n\nAbout 1 in 1000 people who get chikungunya die from the disease. People older than 65, newborn babies, and people with other medical problems are most likely to have the most dangerous problems. Chikungunya is especially dangerous for newborns because they can get the virus from their mothers during childbirth, and because newborns' immune systems have to grow before they work as well as adults'. This makes it much more difficult for newborns to fight off the virus. \n\nElderly people, and people who already have arthritis, are more likely to have chronic joint pain. \n\nIn the past, chikungunya existed mostly in developing countries. However, more recently, there have been epidemics (where a very large number of people get the virus) in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Islands, and the Americas. \n\nWhen chikungunya was first discovered in 1952, it was uncommon and happened only in West Africa. People usually got the disease during rainy seasons, because mosquitoes are more common during these times. Beginning in the 1960s, there were sometimes outbreaks in Asia and Africa. However, until 2005, chikungunya had been uncommon throughout the world. \n\nSince 2005, chikungunya has become much more common. It has caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. For example, in India, chikungunya re-appeared after 32 years where no Indian person had gotten the virus. Outbreaks have also happened in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, where chikungunya had never spread before. A few people have also gotten chikungunya in the United States and Australia, where the virus had never lived before. \n\nIn 2005, there was a very large outbreak on R\u00e9union, an island in the Indian Ocean. Out of about 770,000 people who lived on the island, about 266,000 (over 1 in every 3 people) got chikungunya. In 2006, about 1.25 million people in India got the virus. \n\nChikungunya was recently spread to the Americas. From 2013-2014 in the Americas, 1,118,763 people have been thought to have the virus. Of these cases, 24,682 were proven to be chikungunya. \n\nSome scientists think that chikungunya has become much more common because of a change in the virus's genetic code. This change may have made it easier for the virus to make copies of itself in mosquito cells. It may have also allowed the virus to be spread more easily by the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus). This is important because the Asian tiger mosquito lives in many more places than Aedes aegypti, the other species of mosquito that spreads chikungunya to humans. Aedes aegypti lives only in tropical places. However, the Asian tiger mosquito spreads easily, and lives in Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East. \n\nChikungunya was first described by Marion Robinson and W.H.R. Lumsden in 1955, after an outbreak in 1952 along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). A group called the Makonde lived in this area. The word \" chikungunya \" probably comes from the Makonde language. It means \" that which bends up \" or \" to walk bent over. \" This describes how people with very bad joint pain from the virus would bend into unusual positions. \n\nThe first recorded outbreak of chikungunya may have been in 1779. Scientific evidence agrees that the virus evolved around the year 1700. \n\nChikungunya was once researched as a possible biological weapon. \n\n", "timestamp": "2020-06-22T13:46:24Z", "text_length": 10375}
{"title": "Zika fever", "parsed_text": "Zika fever is an illness caused by the Zika virus. The Zika virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus, like dengue fever and chikungunya. However, Zika fever is usually not as bad as those illnesses. Most people who get the Zika virus (60-80%) have no symptoms. \n\nPeople who do have symptoms usually have a low fever, conjunctivitis, joint pain (mainly in the hands and feet), and a rash. The rash often starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body. Usually, the symptoms are not very bad, and get better after 2 to 7 days. \n\nStarting in 2015, there has been an outbreak of Zika virus (meaning that many people have gotten the virus) in Brazil. Scientists think that when a woman with the Zika virus is pregnant, she can give the virus to her fetus. Scientists think this can cause microcephaly , a birth defect that causes a baby to have a smaller head than usual. This can cause intellectual disability and other problems in the brain, like seizures. Because of this, in January 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned pregnant women not to travel to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, or Puerto Rico, because of the risk of getting the Zika virus there. \n\nIn places where the Zika virus lives, people are more likely to have birth defects, neurological problems like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and autoimmune diseases. \n\nDiagnosing Zika fever is difficult for a few reasons. First, Zika fever causes many of the same signs and symptoms as many other viruses. \n\nSecond, special laboratory tests have to be done to prove that a person has Zika virus. For example, when the virus is in a person's blood or urine, it can be found by using a special test that looks for the virus's RNA in the blood. However, the Zika virus often does not stay in the blood for very long. Also, because most people with the Zika virus have no symptoms, they do not know that they need to be tested. Blood tests that look for specific antibodies (which the body sends out to fight the Zika virus) can also be done. However, these tests are expensive and have to be done in special laboratories that do not exist everywhere. \n\nIf tests cannot prove that a person has Zika virus, it can be difficult to figure out whether a person has Zika fever or a different infection. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that before doctors diagnose a person with Zika fever, they should think about whether the person could have one of many other infections. Examples of these infections include: \n\nDengue fever \n\nWest Nile virus \n\nChikungunya \n\nMalaria \n\nRubella \n\nMeasles \n\nLeptospirosis \n\nHumans get the Zika virus after being bitten by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus. Scientists have proven that at least eight different species of mosquitoes from the Aedes genus can spread the Zika virus to humans. Mosquitoes pick up the Zika virus after they bite other animals that have the virus. \n\nZika virus can be passed from one person to another during sexual intercourse. It can also be passed from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy. \n\nThere is no vaccine for Zika virus, though the United States National Institutes of Health is trying to make one. \n\nThe best way for a person to protect themselves against the Zika virus is to protect themselves against mosquitoes. For example, if people are traveling to places where the Zika virus lives, they should: \n\nWear long-sleeved shirts and long pants \n\nUse bug spray \n\nStay and sleep in rooms that are protected by window and door screens, and that have air conditioning (if possible) \n\nUse a mosquito net when sleeping \n\nToday, there is no treatment or cure for Zika fever. Medical professionals can only give \" supportive care, \" which means they can only treat the virus's symptoms. For example, they can give medicines to help with pain, fever, and itching. However, some scientists say that doctors should not give medicines like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used for pain and fever. This is because people with similar viruses who take these medicines have been more likely to have bleeding problems. \n\nThere are no known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) which will kill the Zika virus. \n\nBecause there are no treatments that will cure the Zika virus once a person has it, scientists suggest that pregnant women do everything they can to avoid getting the virus. Once a pregnant woman has the Zika virus, there is nothing anyone can do to keep her fetus from getting infected too. \n\nZika fever was first discovered in 1947, in a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest in Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A few outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa and in some parts of Southeast Asia. , but not India. In 1977\u20131978, Zika virus caused fevers in Indonesia. \n\nThe first major outbreak happened in 2007 in Micronesia's Yap Islands. 185 people were proven to have the Zika virus. This was the first time Zika fever had been reported outside Africa and Asia. In 2013, another large outbreak happened in French Polynesia. \n\nIn May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of Zika fever. By November 2015, Zika fever had appeared in 14 states in Brazil. Zika virus is thought to have caused 2,400 cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015. \n\nSince first appearing in the Western Hemisphere in February 2014, Zika fever has spread quickly throughout South America and Central America. It appeared in Mexico in November 2015. \n\nOn January 24, 2016, the World Health Organization warned that the Zika virus is likely to spread to nearly all countries of the Americas. This is likely since the mosquito that spreads the virus, Aedes aegypti, lives in all of the countries in the Americas, except for Canada and Chile. \n\nOn February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization said that the Zika virus was a \" public health emergency. \" They also said the Zika virus was \" spreading explosively \" (very quickly), and that in the next year, as many as 3 million to 4 million people could get the virus. \n\nFlaviviruses \n\nAedes genus of mosquitoes \n\nAedes agypti \n\nInfectious disease \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-02-15T15:25:08Z", "text_length": 8850}
{"title": "Marasmus", "parsed_text": "Marasmus is a form of malnutrition. It happens in people (especially children) who do not get enough food. A healthy person gets energy from eating food, especially foods with protein and fat in them. Because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food, they do not get the energy they need to survive. This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories. Generally, this disease when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births. Lean and weak, swelling limbs, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc.., are the symptoms of this disease. \n\nChildren with marasmus look emaciated (very skinny). This is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and muscles to make energy. The child's body weight will be less than 60% of a normal child his or her age. \n\nMarasmus can be treated. However, about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they cannot get treatment where they live. \n\nThe word \u201cmarasmus\u201d comes from the Greek word \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 marasmos (meaning \" decay <nowiki> '' </nowiki> ) \n\nMost children with marasmus look shrunken and have lost most of their muscles and body fat. Their bodies try to save as much energy as possible by shutting down the immune system, not growing, and giving less energy to the liver, kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal system. This can cause problems like: \n\nHaving too much fluid in the body, because the kidneys are not working well enough to get rid of it. This can lead toedema (fluid under the skin) and even heart failure. \n\nHypothermia (low body temperature), because staying warm takes energy, and because the child has almost no fat or muscles to keep them warm \n\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar), because the child is not getting sugar or carbohydrates from foods \n\nInfection, because the child's body has shut down the immune system, which usually fights infection, to save energy \n\nOther symptoms of marasmus include: \n\nAnemia (not having enough red blood cells in the blood) \n\nDehydration, not having enough water in the body \n\nShock caused by dehydration (hypovolemic shock) \n\nTachypnea (breathing too fast - for example, from pneumonia or heart failure) \n\nEye problems \n\nSkin problems \n\nProblems with the ears, nose, and throat (like ear infections) \n\nMarasmus is caused by a deficiency (not having enough) of nearly all nutrients, especially protein, carbohydrates, and lipids (fats). \n\nMarasmus can be treated by giving emergency nutrients and fluids. However, treating the causes of marasmus is not enough. Often, the disease has complications (it causes other problems), like infections, dehydration, and problems with the circulatory system.

{"title": "Brain death", "parsed_text": "Brain death means that the brain has stopped working. Brain death is permanent, and cannot be cured or reversed. No treatment can help. When a person is brain dead, there is no activity in any part of their brain. Every part of the brain is dead; no oxygen flows to the brain, and there is no electrical activity in any part of the brain. \n\nThe brain controls everything we need to do to stay alive. For example, it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, and many other important things. When a person is brain dead, their brain cannot control any of these things. A brain-dead person cannot breathe on their own. They will never be able to wake up or be aware of what is going on around them. \n\nSometimes, brain-dead people are kept alive with special machines and medications. For example, doctors can put a tube down a person's throat and use a machine called a ventilator to pump oxygen into their lungs. While these machines can keep the person's other organs alive for a while, they cannot help the brain get better. Eventually, the person's other organs will stop working too. \n\nDoctors can diagnose brain death by examining the patient. They will check for reflexes which are controlled by the brainstem, and see if the person can breathe on their own. If the person is brain-dead, the doctor will find: \n\nThe person has no reflexes (for example, they do not gag when the doctor touches the back of their throat) \n\nThe person's pupils do not change size in bright light or in the dark \n\nThe person does not move or react when the doctor does something painful (like pinching the person's skin) \n\nThe person does not try to breathe on their own \n\nBefore diagnosing brain death, doctors will check for any other problem that could look like brain death (for example, a very low body temperature, or an overdose of sedatives). They will usually wait six to 24 hours before checking again to make sure the person still has no signs of activity in the brain. Then a second doctor is called in to do the same tests. If both doctors agree, the patient can officially be diagnosed \" brain dead. \" \n\nSometimes, doctors use other tests which can diagnose brain death right away. These tests include: \n\nEEG, which records the electrical activity in the brain. A brain-dead person will have no electrical activity in their brain. \n\nBrain scans like CT scans. A brain-dead person will have no blood flowing to their brain. \n\nBrain death happens because of an injury to the entire brain. The most common causes are: \n\nA very bad head injury \n\nA stroke which cut off the brain's oxygen supply or caused bleeding in the brain \n\nSwelling in the brain, either from an infection like encephalitis, or from the brain not getting enough oxygen. \n\nSwelling or bleeding in the brain can cut off blood flow to the brain and push on the brainstem.

{"title": "Intracranial hemorrhage", "parsed_text": "An intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain. ( \" Intracranial \" means \" inside the skull \" ; \" hemorrhage \" means \" dangerous bleeding \" ). The most dangerous type of stroke, a hemorrhagic stroke, is a type of intracranial hemorrhage. It is a bleed in the brain that happens when the brain has not been injured. \n\nWhen blood vessels in the brain break or are injured, they bleed. Bleeding in the brain is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain. It can also make it impossible for oxygen to get past the blood to parts of the brain. Without oxygen, these parts of the brain will die. \n\nBleeding in the brain can happen for two reasons. It can happen because of a head injury. A bad head injury can break some of the blood vessels in the brain. \n\nBleeding in the brain can also happen when blood vessels in the brain break without being injured. For example, this may happen when a cerebral aneurysm bursts. \n\nThe three most common types of bleeding problems in the brain are epidural hematomas, subdural hematomas, and subarachnoid hemorrhages. These happen in different parts of the meninges (the layers that cover the brain). \n\nAn epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull. ( \" Epidural \" means \" on top of the dura; \" a \" hematoma \" is a collection of blood.) Usually, injuries to the head cause epidural hematomas by tearing arteries in the dura. Because the arteries in the dura are large, they carry a lot of blood. If one of these arteries is injured, it can bleed very quickly, and an epidural hematoma can build up almost right away. \n\nAbout 15% to 20% of people with epidural hematomas die from them. \n\nThe picture at the top of this page shows an epidural hematoma. The bleeding (shown in light gray) is between the skull (the thick white outside layer) and the rest of the brain (shown in dark gray). \n\nA subdural hematoma is a collection of blood under the dura mater, between the dura and the arachnoid layer. ( \" Subdural \" means \" under the dura. \" ) Usually, subdural hematomas are caused by injuries to the head that tear veins. Because these veins are smaller, and because veins do not bleed as fast as arteries, subdural hematomas may not bleed as quickly as epidural hematomas. \n\nSubdural hematomas can happen right away after a bad injury to the head. These are called acute subdural hematomas. These are the most dangerous of all head injuries. They kill about 60% to 80% of people who have them. \n\nSubdural hematomas can also be chronic. This means they take days or weeks to happen. They are usually caused by injuries to the head that are not very bad. Sometimes, if a person has a vein in their dura that slowly leaks blood every now and then, chronic subdural hematomas can take years to build up. \n\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater). ( \" Subarachnoid \" means \" under the arachnoid. \" ) Because the subarachnoid space holds cerebrospinal fluid, bleeding here makes blood mix into the cerebrospinal fluid. The blood irritates the brain and spinal cord, and causes symptoms like a very bad headache and a stiff neck. \n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages can be caused by head injuries. They can also happen when an aneurysm in one of the arachnoid layer's blood vessels bursts and starts bleeding. \n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages are very dangerous. About half of all people with subarachnoid hemorrhages die from them. About 10% to 15% die before they even get to the hospital.

Electricity travels down pathways in the heart to make each part of the heart beat at the right time. \n\nWhen a person has a heart block, there is a \u201cblock\u201d in one of these electrical pathways. This blocks electricity from travelling normally through the heart. This makes the heart beat more slowly. \n\nIn the most serious cases, the heart\u2019s electrical pathways are blocked so badly that electricity cannot travel through the heart. This means the heart\u2019s electrical signals cannot control how the heart beats, or cannot make the heart beat at all. \n\nMany people with heart block have no symptoms at all. \n\nOther people only have symptoms every once in a while. Sometimes, their heart might skip a beat. This can make the person feel dizzy; faint; or have palpitations (feel their heart pounding). \n\nIn the most serious cases of heart block, a person's heart cannot control their heart beats. These cases can be treated with an artificial pacemaker. This is a medical device that is placed into the heart. It sends electrical signals to make the heart beat regularly. \n\nSome people are born with heart block. This is called a congenital heart block. \n\nMore often, people get heart block later in life. Heart block can be caused by: \n\nOther types of heart disease, like a heart attack \n\nSome infections, like diphtheria \n\nSome medicines, like beta-blockers (a type of medicine for high blood pressure) \n\nHaving open-heart surgery \n\nThere are three main types of heart block. \n\nThis is the least serious type of heart block. It usually causes no symptoms. \n\nIn second-degree heart block, it takes longer and longer for the heart to send electrical signals from the middle of the heart to the ventricles, which pump blood to the body. Eventually, this leads to a skipped heart beat. This can cause dizziness and fainting. \n\nThis is the most serious type of heart block. It is also called a complete heart block. In this type of heart block, no electrical signals reach the heart's ventricles. This means that the electrical signals cannot make the heart pump blood to the body. \n\nSome people with third-degree heart block may have very few symptoms and may not need treatment. However, some people with third-degree heart block have many different symptoms. Third-degree heart block can be a medical emergency. This type of heart block may be treated with a pacemaker. \n\nHeart block can be diagnosed with an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or an EKG). This is a painless test.

When a person has POTS, their heart beats faster than normal when they stand up.

It does this to push blood to the brain. Then the person's heart rate goes back to normal. \n\nWhen a person with POTS stands up, their heart beats much faster than normal. POTS is diagnosed when a person's heart rate increases by at least 30 beats per minute within 10 minutes after they stand up. This is called postural tachycardia. \n\nPeople with POTS also have other symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (symptoms that get worse when a person is standing up, and get better when the person is lying down). These symptoms may include: \n\nPalpitations (feeling the heart pounding) \n\nFeeling dizzy, fainting, or almost fainting \n\nChest pain \n\nTrouble breathing, especially when exercising \n\nFeeling very weak or tired \n\nBlurred vision (not being able to see clearly) \n\nHeadache \n\nTrouble concentrating or thinking \n\nNausea \n\nTrouble sleeping \n\nPallor (pale skin) or sweating \n\nSymptoms may get worse if a person with POTS: \n\nSits for a long time \n\nStands for a long time \n\nDrinks alcohol or caffeine \n\nGets too hot \n\nExercises too much \n\nEats a large meal \n\nPOTS can be caused by many different things. Many of these causes are not well understood. \n\nSome of the known causes of POTS include: \n\nGenetics \n\nRecently being sick with a virus \n\nChronic diabetes \n\nHypovolemia (not having enough blood in the body). This causes less blood to get to the heart. The body tries to fix this by making the heart beat faster, so more blood will get pushed into the heart. \n\nProblems with the nerves in the lower legs. This causes blood to pool in the lower legs. The body tries to fix this by making the heart beat faster so it can push more blood to the rest of the body. \n\nPOTS is more common in: \n\nWomen between the ages of 15 and 50 \n\nPeople who have recently been pregnant, had surgery, had a recent trauma, or had to rest in bed for a long time \n\nPeople who have had autoimmune diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, anemia, hyperthyroidism, fibromyalgia, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and cancer \n\nThere are many different treatments for the symptoms of POTS. Some of these treatments include: \n\nDrinking a lot of water (this increases the amount of fluid in the body, which helps blood get to the heart more easily) \n\nEating a high-salt diet (this helps keep fluid in the body and helps people with POTS from getting dehydrated) \n\nGetting exercise, especially exercise like recumbent bicycling (bicycling while lying back, which prevents symptoms caused by being upright) \n\nUsing compression stockings (very tight socks) to keep blood from pooling in the legs \n\nAvoiding things that can make POTS worse, like getting dehydrated, exercising too much, eating large meals, drinking alcohol, or getting too hot \n\nNo medications have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat POTS. However, sometimes doctors treat POTS with medications that: \n\nPrevent the body from losing salt; \n\nRaise blood pressure; and/or \n\nKeep the heart from pumping too fast. \n\nMost people with POTS are able to get better with treatment. About 6 out of every 10 people with POTS is able to recover within 5 years of being diagnosed with POTS.

{"title": "Ataxia", "parsed_text": "Ataxia is trouble with balance that is not caused by a person's muscles being weak. Instead, ataxia is caused by a neurological problem. \n\nAtaxia is not a diagnosis. It is a neurological sign. It is a sign of damage to the parts of the nervous system that control balance. \n\nThere are three different types of ataxia. Each type has many possible causes. \n\nCerebellar ataxia is ataxia that is caused by a problem with a person's cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination. It makes the body move smoothly and controls movements like walking. \n\nPeople with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble with actions like these: \n\nControlling how hard their muscles contract, how fast, and in what direction \n\nGetting their muscles to work together (asynergy) \n\nWalking (gait abnormality) \n\nMoving their eyes \n\nSwallowing (dysphagia) \n\nSaying words (dysarthria) \n\nJudging how far away something is (dysmetria) \n\nReacting quickly \n\nSensory ataxia is caused by the loss of proprioception (knowing where parts of the body are). It is usually caused by damage to the parts of the spinal cord that carry information about proprioception to the brain. However, it can also be caused by damage to the parts of the brain that receive that information (the cerebellum, the thalamus, and the parietal lobes of the brain). \n\nA person with sensory ataxia may have these symptoms: \n\nThey may have trouble walking. They may stomp their feet and hit their heels hard against the ground while they walk \n\nTrouble walking that gets worse when the person cannot see well \n\nFor example, if the person stands with their feet together and their eyes closed, their balance problems will get much worse, and they may fall. Doctors call this a \" positive Romberg's test. \n\nVestibular ataxia is caused by problems with the vestibular system. This is the body's main sensory system that controls balance and movement. It includes the inner ear. \n\nAlong with balance problems, people with vestibular ataxia may have: \n\nNausea and vomiting \n\nDizziness \n\nThere are many different causes of ataxia. The National Ataxia Foundation breaks up these causes into three categories: acquired, genetic, and idiopathic. \n\nA person is not born with acquired ataxia. Acquired means that something happened during the person's life to cause the ataxia. \n\nCauses of acquired ataxia can include: \n\nStroke, brain tumor, or multiple sclerosis \n\nA person can acquire (get) any of the three types of ataxia from these problems in the brain, depending on where the problem happens. For example, if a person has a brain tumor in their cerebellum, they may get cerebellar ataxia. If the tumor is in the vestibular system, the person may get vestibular ataxia. \n\nSpinal cord injuries \n\nProblems that damage parts of the cerebellum. These problems can include: \n\nAlcohol abuse, drug abuse, or use of certain medications which can cause ataxia \n\nHypothyroidism \n\nHead injury \n\nViral illnesses, like viral meningitis \n\nCeliac disease \n\nMercury poisoning \n\nRadiation poisoning \n\nVitamin B12 deficiency (not having enough vitamin B12 in the body) \n\nGenetic ataxia is caused by hereditary disorders that damage the cerebellum or spine. People are born with these disorders. In most cases, they get worse over time. \n\nIdiopathic means that doctors cannot find a cause for a person's ataxia. \n\nIdiopathic ataxias often cause symptoms that come and go. Many doctors and scientists think these ataxias are caused by a combination of things inside the body (like gene problems) and things outside the body (like the things happening in a person's life). However, they are still researching the causes of idiopathic ataxias. \n\nAtaxia can be treated. However, treatment usually does not make ataxia go away completely. \n\nSome treatments for ataxia include: A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009. \n\nMedications \n\nPhysical therapy \n\nOccupational therapy \n\nUsing a cane or walker to help with balance \n\nSome people with severe ataxia may need to use wheelchairs. \n\nBalance \n\nProprioception \n\nCerebellum \n\nSpinal cord \n\nVestibular system \n\n", "timestamp": "2017-10-26T06:14:00Z", "text_length": 5342}

This can make noises sound quieter as well as make noise less clear, it can also cause other hearing related symptoms such as tinnitus. NHL is permanent and cannot usually be restored. \n\nMost of the time, NHL happens after being around a lot of noise for long periods of time. Listening to loud music, city traffic or even things like a hair dryer for can damage hearing after a while. But NHL can also happen suddenly when close to an extremely loud sound. This can come from things like being close to an airplane or a gunshot. \n\nHearing is a very important sense. It can be hard to notice hearing loss, especially if it happens over time instead of suddenly. Even if it is hard for a person experiencing it to notice, it will still have a large effect on their life. \n\nNot being able to hear a conversation when there is a lot of noise around is usually a good sign of hearing loss. Other people may sound like they are speaking softly or their speech may not be clear. Both of these can be signs of NHL. Similarly, having to ask people to repeat themselves and having to try very hard to hear people speak are also signs. \n\nApart from not being able to hear very well when talking to other people, there are other signs of NHL such as tinnitus as well as some other diseases and medication. \n\nSince NHL causes permanent damage, knowing the signs and causes of it and preventing it early is the only way to keep hearing healthy. \n\nLowering the volume of sound is a good way to start. Even though controlling the level of sound heard is not always possible, when listening to music or watching movies it can be done and will keep hearing from being damaged. \n\nIf controlling the level of sound is not possible then avoiding being around loud sound for a long time will help too. This is because the level of sound is not the only thing that is important for hearing loss, how long this loud sound is present is important as well. \n\nIf none of the above methods to prevent hearing loss are possible, then using earplugs or earmuffs is a must. This will reduce the sound that is able to reach and cause damage to the ears. This is useful for people who work in places that are loud such as a construction site. \n\nAlthough NHL is permanent and most of the time cannot be cured, there are ways to manage it. \n\nThe most common thing to do is use hearing aids. Hearing aids can help with hearing loss by making sound louder and speech clearer. They can also be customised by audiologists to suit almost any lifestyle and to suit the specific needs of different people. \n\n", "timestamp": "2019-05-03T16:58:51Z", "text_length": 2848}

Even though it occurs naturally, there are factors that can make it worse and make it happen earlier in life. Presbycusis is usually a form of sensorineural hearing loss, which means that it is due to problems in the inner ear or the hearing nerve due to loss or damage to the hair cells that line the inner ear. The most common causes of sensorineural hearing loss are exposure to loud noise for long periods of time as well as some diseases. \n\nMost hearing loss can both be prevented or managed if the proper precautions are taken. \n\nNoise-induced hearing loss in particular, coming from exposure to loud sounds can be prevented by using protection as well as avoidance \n\nHearing loss can be managed through the use of hearing aids and is used by many elderly people experiencing presbycusis.

Patients will need to learn to use hearing protection against sounds which are very loud, but to not use these in everyday situations.

NB: In British English, \" licence \" is the noun, \" to license \" is the verb. In US English, the noun is \" license \" (see #ENGVAR). \n\nThe FDA \" Label Information \" and the EMA \" Product Information \" , where available, are very detailed. There is material aimed at the professional and also plain-English consumer information. These are excellent reliable source for article information but also contains much that makes it a worthwhile \" External link \" since there is no way one can include all the info. Both sites work when using the brand name of the drug but the FDA site also allows searches with the generic name (active ingredient), which lists generic variants where they are licensed. Health Canada's site operates similarly to the FDA's site, with Canada-specific drug monographs and other information. The DailyMed site is a more user-friendly repository of primarily labeling information. For all sites, the use of the generic name of the drug is preferred whenever possible as this will list all brand and generic forms of the drug. \n\n<pre> \n\n| licence_CA = \n\n| licence_EU = \n\n| DailyMedID = \n\n| licence_US = \n\n</pre> \n\n: will create a link to the EMA site, using the INN (i.e., INN, drug_name or article title).

Typically the chemical class (e.g., benzodiazepine), mechanism of action (e.g., beta blocker), mode of action (e.g., diuretic), and/or therapeutic class (e.g., analgesic). Hence this field may contain more than one drug class if appropriate (each preferably ). \n\nWhere the drug is not included in ATC coding system (as opposed to its value just not been entered into the template) then set ATC_prefix to 'none', and the article is automatically added to : \n\n<pre> \n\n| ATC_prefix = none \n\n</pre> \n\nAdditional ATC may be included with the optional parameter as a comma-separated list. ATC templates may be used to have these additional codes link to the relevant databases: \n\n<pre> \n\n| ATC_supplemental =, \n\n</pre> \n\nAdds the following linked codes: \n\n:For ATC - , \n\nVeterinary drugs are placed in a slightly different classification system, ATCvet.

{"title": "Coronavirus disease 2019", "parsed_text": " \n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus closely related to the SARS virus. \n\nThe disease is the cause of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak. Those who get the disease might get a fever, dry cough, fatigue (tiredness) and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. In very bad cases, they can even get a much worse fever, decreased white blood cells, might cough up blood, and have kidney failure. \n\nPeople with this disease can get pneumonia and multi-organ failure if they are weak, old, or are already sick. There are people who are called asymptomatic carriers, which means that they did not have all or some of the symptoms of the virus. This is very dangerous since they may not know that they have the virus and can transfer it to other people without knowing it. The countries with the most sick people, are Italy, the United Kingdom and the USA. \n\n+ Symptoms of COVID-19 \n\nSymptom \n\nRange \n\nFever \n\n83\u201399% \n\nCough \n\n59\u201382% \n\nLoss of appetite \n\n40\u201384% \n\nTiredness/fatigue \n\n44\u201370% \n\nShortness of breath \n\n31\u201340% \n\nCoughing up sputum \n\n28\u201333% \n\nMuscle aches and pains \n\n11\u201335% \n\nAccording to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things. \n\nAccording to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs. \n\nIn February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19, replacing the temporary name \" 2019-nCoV. \" \" Co \" is for \" corona, \" \" Vi \" for \" virus, \" and \" D \" for \" disease, \" and \" 19 \" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like \" Wuhan, \" because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud. \n\nThe expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, which help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease. \n\nScientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels. \n\nScientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs. \n\nThere are many ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Washing hands for at least 20 seconds will help destroy the viruses. Avoiding touching your own eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands is another way to avoid catching COVID-19. \n\nPeople should avoid crowded places whenever possible, because close contact with large groups of people can easily spread the virus. In fact, many health organizations say that people should stay at least two metres from another person.. Some people wear face masks to avoid catching the virus, and it is recommended by countries such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. \n\nExperts recommend testing people for COVID-19. Some people may have SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies but not feel sick right away. These people can spread the virus to others. \n\nThere are two types of tests. Viral tests show whether a person has the virus right then. Antibody tests show whether the person had the virus and has since recovered. \n\nA group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20 minutes. They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2. \n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is new to humans. This means that there are no medicines that can stop people from getting COVID-19 or that can treat them if they do get it. Scientists are working hard to invent and test new medicines. Some scientists are trying to invent a new vaccine which would stop people from getting sick with COVID-19. Other scientists are testing medicines used for other diseases to see if those medicines make people get less sick if they do get COVID-19. \n\nIn April 2020, the group Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said that scientists were looking at 115 compounds that could be a vaccine. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says it takes 18 months to test a vaccine to make sure it works and is safe. \n\nIn April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc, and tested it in mice. \n\nAnother team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called \" human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 \" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01. \n\nIn late April 2020, a team from Oxford University said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020. \n\nOther scientists are developing vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines will take less time to develop and make than protein or whole-virus vaccines. \n\nIn mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021. \n\nSome people thought hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, might work against COVID-19. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. United States President Donald Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine and told other people to take it too, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, part of the White House official coronavirus task force, said no one could know for sure if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration allowed doctors to give hydroxychloroquine and another drug called chloroquine to COVID-19 patients, but in June, they told doctors to stop. By then, more studies had shown that the drugs did not help much and could harm the patients' hearts. \n\nSome scientists also think the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against other viruses and it has already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away. \n\nDoctors gave remdesivir to some COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works. \n\nThe chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies. \n\nSome scientists gave SARS and MERS to llamas so the llamas' immune systems would make antibodies, or natural medicines, against those viruses, and they found a few antibodies that worked. In a May 2020 study, the scientists said this could work with SARS-CoV-2 too. \n\nAbenomask (One of the Japanese governmental response against the outbreak) \n\nCOVID-19 in Canada \n\nCOVID-19 pandemic in Japan \n\nWHO site for COVID-19 \n\nCDC site for COVID-19 \n\nWHO questions on COVID-19", "timestamp": "2020-06-23T23:11:45Z", "text_length": 13098}
