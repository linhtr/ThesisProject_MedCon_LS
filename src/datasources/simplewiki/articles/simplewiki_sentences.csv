Boil;1;Boil might mean:   Boiling, heating a liquid to the point where it turns into gas   Boil, a type of Staphylococcal infection
Bubonic plague;1;Bubonic plague is the best-known form of the disease plague, which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis.
Bubonic plague;2;The name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the lymphatic system.
Bubonic plague;3;If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days.
Bubonic plague;4;The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the Middle Ages.
Bubonic plague;5;Symptoms of this disease include coughing, fever, and black spots on the skin.
Bubonic plague;6;There are different kinds of Bubonic plague.
Bubonic plague;7;The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea, that lives on rats.
Bubonic plague;8;Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days.
Bubonic plague;9;Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the blood and makes it form tiny clots.
Bubonic plague;10;This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs.
Bubonic plague;11;About 95% of all people with this form will die.
Bubonic plague;12;Incubation period is only one to two days.
Bubonic plague;13;This is the most harmless form.
Bubonic plague;14;It will result in a little fever.
Bubonic plague;15;After that, there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time.
Bubonic plague;16;The first recorded epidemic was in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), It was called the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.
Bubonic plague;17;The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).
Bubonic plague;18;During the 1300s, this epidemic struck parts of Asia, North Africa, and Europe.
Bubonic plague;19;Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it.
Bubonic plague;20;Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another.
Bubonic plague;21;"Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the time, described it: "" This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands."
Bubonic plague;22;"But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children "" ."
Bubonic plague;23;Local outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague pandemics, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion.
Bubonic plague;24;The pandemics were:   the first plague pandemic from 541 to ~750, spreading from Egypt to the Mediterranean (starting with the Plague of Justinian) and northwestern Europe   the second plague pandemic from ~1331 to ~1855, spreading from Central Asia to the Mediterranean and Europe (starting with the Black Death), and probably also to China   the third plague pandemic from 1855 to 1960, spreading from China to various places around the world, notably India and the West Coast of the United States.
Bubonic plague;25;Globally about 600 cases of plague are reported a year.
Bubonic plague;26;In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.
Bubonic plague;27;The transmission of Y. pestis by fleas is well known.
Bubonic plague;28;Fleas are the vector.
Bubonic plague;29;The flea gets the bacteria as they feed on an infected animal, usually a rodent.
Bubonic plague;30;Several proteins then work to keep the bacteria in the flea digestive tract.
Bubonic plague;31;This is important for the survival of Y. pestis in fleas.
Bubonic plague;32;In the 20th century, some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague.
Bubonic plague;33;They did research to use it for biological warfare.
Bubonic plague;34;Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled.
Bubonic plague;35;There is much paranoia (fear) about it.
Bubonic plague;36;Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes.
Bubonic plague;37;This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis.
Bubonic plague;38;This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague.
Bubonic plague;39;The FBI did not find the samples.
Bubonic plague;40;They do not know what happened to them.
Diarrhea;1;Diarrhea (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled diarrhoea, happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal.
Diarrhea;2;Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals   Diarrhea is not a disease.
Diarrhea;3;But it may be a symptom of a disease.
Diarrhea;4;"The most common causes of diarrhea are:   Viruses, like Norovirus (the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis— "" stomach flu "" —in humans)   Bacteria, like E. coli or C. diff   Some medicines, especially antibiotics   Food poisoning   Lactose intolerance   Artificial sweeteners, like sorbitol and mannitol, which are in many sugar-free food products like sugarless gum   Other problems with the intestines, like Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome   In developing nations, diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5."
Diarrhea;5;Every year in the world, diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under age 5.
Diarrhea;6;In developing countries, diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age 5.
Diarrhea;7;When children die from diarrhea, the cause is often dehydration (losing too much water from the body).
Diarrhea;8;Because diarrhea is watery, it takes away a lot of the water.
Diarrhea;9;It also takes away electrolytes—important salts that the body needs to survive.
Diarrhea;10;Dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with.
Diarrhea;11;This means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems.
Diarrhea;12;In developing countries, diarrhea is usually caused by an infection in the intestines.
Diarrhea;13;These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
Diarrhea;14;These infections spread easily in some developing countries because of the following reasons:   Unsafe drinking water.
Diarrhea;15;Bacteria, viruses, and parasites often get into the water, which people then have to drink.
Diarrhea;16;Anyone who drinks the water can then get an infection that causes diarrhea.
Diarrhea;17;Sanitation, with clean toilets, is often not available.
Diarrhea;18;This makes it easier for infections to spread.
Diarrhea;19;Clean water and soap for washing hands are often not available, either.
Diarrhea;20;If people cannot wash their hands, bacteria, viruses, or parasites can stay on their hands.
Diarrhea;21;These microbes can then enter the mouth or get spread to other people with handshaking.
Diarrhea;22;Child deaths from diarrhea can be prevented in different ways.
Diarrhea;23;When a child is sick with diarrhea, the best way to keep them from dying is to rehydrate them (give them the water and electrolytes (salts) they are losing by having diarrhea).
Diarrhea;24;If the child can go to a clinic or hospital, this can be done by giving water and salts intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein).
Diarrhea;25;If the child cannot go to a clinic or hospital, oral rehydration solution can be used.
Diarrhea;26;"( "" Oral "" means "" given by mouth "" ; a "" solution "" is a mixture.)"
Diarrhea;27;Oral rehydration solution is a mixture of the most important things the body loses when it is dehydrated.
Diarrhea;28;These things are clean water, salt, and sugar.
Diarrhea;29;Some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes, like potassium, in them also.
Diarrhea;30;Some oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water.
Diarrhea;31;Oral rehydration solution can also be made at home.
Diarrhea;32;If the water in the area is not safe, it can be boiled to make it safe.
Diarrhea;33;(Boiling the water will kill any bacteria, viruses, or parasites in the water.)
Diarrhea;34;Salt and sugar are then mixed into the water.
Diarrhea;35;Drinking this mixture, after the water cools, will re-hydrate the child, if he drinks enough.
Diarrhea;36;Adding a banana or orange juice can add potassium to the mixture.
Diarrhea;37;Breast milk will also re-hydrate a child with diarrhea.
Diarrhea;38;There are some ways to prevent diarrhea, or the spread of diseases that cause diarrhea.
Diarrhea;39;However, some of these ways are expensive and difficult to do.
Diarrhea;40;These include:   Making drinking water safe   Making sanitation better   Making clean water and soap available for hand washing   Feces
Scurvy;1;Scurvy is a disease (sickness).
Scurvy;2;It is caused by not eating enough vitamin C. But scurvy can be prevented.
Scurvy;3;It has many symptoms.
Scurvy;4;People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs.
Scurvy;5;Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out.
Scurvy;6;They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucus membranes).
Scurvy;7;A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see depression).
Scurvy;8;They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt.
Scurvy;9;Scurvy can be easily cured.
Scurvy;10;Oranges and other fruits can restore vitamins.
Scurvy;11;In the past, sailors more commonly got scurvy.
Scurvy;12;Fresh fruit could not be kept for long.
Scurvy;13;The main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Scurvy;14;It is uncommon today.
Scurvy;15;At first, a person with scurvy may:   #Not want to eat (loss of appetite)   #Feel sad (slight depression)   #Lose weight or not get heavier even though they eat a lot   #Have loose feces (diarrhea)   #Breathe fast (tachypnea)   #Be hot (have a high body temperature or fever)   A bit later a person with scurvy may:   #Feel angry (irritability)   #Have pains in the legs (and tenderness)   #Find it hard to move (pseudo paralysis)   #Have swelling of the arms and legs   #Bleed from the mouth, nose and gums   #Not eating enough food that has vitamin C   #Going on a long trip, often at sea, where there is no fresh food   #Not having enough food (famine)   #Breaking down the vitamin C by over-cooking (like boiling fruit juice)   #Eating vitamin C pills or giving it by needle (injection, also known as a shot).
Scurvy;16;The injection almost always cures scurvy in babies.
Scurvy;17;#Drinking orange juice is another treatment that works in babies.
Scurvy;18;Before vitamin C was discovered this was the only treatment.
Scurvy;19;When a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly.
Scurvy;20;Babies start eating again after one or two days of help.
Scurvy;21;The symptoms get better within seven days.
Scurvy;22;Eating vitamin C prevents scurvy.
Scurvy;23;How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women.
Scurvy;24;The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council's advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day:   Infants (babies): 30–40 mg   Children and adults: 45–60 mg   Pregnant women: 70 mg   Mothers breast feeding: 90–95 mg   Foods with a lot of vitamin C include the following:   Citrus fruits (for example: oranges, limes)   Berries   Cantaloupe   Broccoli   Cauliflower   Cabbage   Spinach   Potatoes   Tomatoes   Strawberries
Schizophrenia;1;Schizophrenia is a mental illness.
Schizophrenia;2;In a family oriented treatment program in Finland, Open Dialog, 8 out of 10 people with schizophrenia get well with no medication or very limited drug use, often only with anxiety medication.
Schizophrenia;3;The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.
Schizophrenia;4;";Positive symptoms   Positive symptoms are thoughts, behaviors, or anything experienced by the senses that are not shared by others - like hearing voices that are not really there."
Schizophrenia;5;"They are called 'positive' not because they are good but because they are "" added on "" ."
Schizophrenia;6;These symptoms may include having strange thoughts that do not make sense (delusions), disorganized thoughts and speech, and feeling, hearing, seeing, smelling, or tasting things that do not exist (hallucinations).
Schizophrenia;7;Positive symptoms often respond to drug treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT.
Schizophrenia;8;Stopping anti-psychotic or anti-vomiting drugs too quickly may also cause these symptoms.
Schizophrenia;9;";Negative symptoms   Negative symptoms are thoughts, behaviors or emotions normally present in a healthy person that a person with a mental disorder has less of or may not have at all; they are 'minus' these."
Schizophrenia;10;"The sign for minus is -; it is also the sign for the word "" negative "" ."
Schizophrenia;11;"Negative symptoms includes a 'flat affect'; having a blank inexpressive look on the face and/or monosyllabic speech (speech always sounding the same) spoken in a slow monotone, few gestures, lack of interest in anything including other people, and an inability to act spontaneously or feel pleasure."
Schizophrenia;12;These problems are also side effects of anti-psychoctic drugs.
Schizophrenia;13;They may also be symptoms of many medical problems such as a metabolism that is too low.
Schizophrenia;14;";Cognitive symptoms (or cognitive deficits)   Cognitive symptoms are problems with attention, certain types of memory, a   the concept of time, and with the ability to plan and organize."
Schizophrenia;15;Cognitive deficits caused by schizophrenia can also be difficult to recognize as part of the disorder.
Schizophrenia;16;They are the most disabling of the symptoms because cognitive problems affect everyday functioning.
Schizophrenia;17;These problems may also be side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, antidepressants, sleeping medication and anti-anxiety drugs.
Schizophrenia;18;A combination of what has happened to a person and the person’s genes may play a role in the development of schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;19;People who have family members with schizophrenia and who experienced a brief period of psychotic symptoms have a 20 to 40 percent chance of being diagnosed one year later.
Schizophrenia;20;This may be both the result of stressful events because of the family member and possibly a genetic effect.
Schizophrenia;21;";Inherited factors   It is difficult to know if schizophrenia is inherited because it is hard to find out whether something comes from genes or the environment."
Schizophrenia;22;Those who have a parent, a brother or sister with schizophrenia have a higher risk of developing schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;23;The risk is even higher if you have an identical twin with schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;24;This may seem to show that schizophrenia is inherited.
Schizophrenia;25;However, it may be the stress of living with a schizophrenic family member that is traumatic.
Schizophrenia;26;Identical twins are much closer and are treated much more in the same way, and this may be the reason why one of them is more likely to get schizophrenia if the other has it.
Schizophrenia;27;Dr Jay Joseph has found many problems with the scientific studies of inheriting schizophrenia, including false reporting of results.
Schizophrenia;28;Joseph also claims that 40 years of the search for the schizophrenia gene has not found a single gene that independent research groups have confirmed.
Schizophrenia;29;";Environmental factors   There are may environmental risk factors factors for schizophrenia such as drug use, stress before birth and in some cases exposure to infectious diseases (a disease that spreads from person to person)."
Schizophrenia;30;In addition, living in a city during childhood or as an adult has been found to double the risk of schizophrenia .
Schizophrenia;31;This is true even after taking into account drug use, race, and the size of one’s social group.
Schizophrenia;32;Other factors that play an important role include whether the person feels socially isolated, as well as social adversity, racial discrimination (treating a person badly because of their race), the person's family not working properly, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.
Schizophrenia;33;There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life.
Schizophrenia;34;";Substance abuse   Several drugs have been linked with the development of schizophrenia and the abuse (harmful use) of certain drugs can cause symptoms like those of schizophrenia."
Schizophrenia;35;About half of those people who have schizophrenia use too much drugs or alcohol, possibly to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, or loneliness.
Schizophrenia;36;Frequent marijuana use may double the risk of serious mental illness, including schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;37;";Smoking   More people with schizophrenia smoke than the general population; it is estimated that at least 60% to as many as 90% of people with schizophrenia smoke."
Schizophrenia;38;Recent research suggests that cigarette smoking may be a risk factor for developing schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;39;Smoking also reduces the effects and side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, and this may be one of the reasons for the high smoking rate.
Schizophrenia;40;Patients taking anti-psychotic drugs die up to 20 years earlier than others, possibly because the medication makes them overweight, gives diabetes and leads to them smoking.
Schizophrenia;41;";Pre-birth factors   Factors such as lack of oxygen, infection, or stress and lack of healthy foods in the mother during pregnancy, might result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life."
Schizophrenia;42;People who have schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern half of the world).
Schizophrenia;43;This might relate to increased rates of exposures to viruses before birth.
Schizophrenia;44;This difference is about 5 to 8 percent.
Schizophrenia;45;";Brain structure   Some people who have schizophrenia have differences in their brain structure compared to those who do not have the disorder."
Schizophrenia;46;These differences are often in the parts of the brain that manage memory, organization, emotions, the control of impulsive behavior, and language.
Schizophrenia;47;For example, there is less brain volume in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes, and problems within the corpus callosum, the band of nerve fibers which connects the left side and the right side of the brain.
Schizophrenia;48;People with schizophrenia also tend to have larger lateral and third ventricles.
Schizophrenia;49;The ventricles are spaces within the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
Schizophrenia;50;";Brain wiring   The human brain has 100 billion neurons; each one of these neurons are connected to many other neurons."
Schizophrenia;51;"One neuron may have as many as 20,000 connections; there is between 100 trillion and 500 trillion neural connections in the adult human brain."
Schizophrenia;52;There are many different parts or 'regions' of the brain.
Schizophrenia;53;To complete a task - like recalling a memory - usually more than one region of the brain is involved, and they are connected by neural networks which is like the brain's wiring.
Schizophrenia;54;It is believed that there are problems with the brain's wiring in schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;55;The DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10 criteria are used to determine whether a person has schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;56;These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities (unusual occurrences) in the behavior of the person, followed by a clinical assessment.
Schizophrenia;57;A person can be determined to have the disease only if the symptoms are severe.
Schizophrenia;58;European countries usually use ICD-10 criteria, while the United States and the rest of the world usually use the Diagnostic and Staticians Manual (DSM).
Schizophrenia;59;The DSM diagnostic criteria is divided into three categories:   Characteristic symptoms: Two or more of these symptoms must each be present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment):   #Delusions   #Hallucinations   #Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of a formal thought disorder   #Very disorganized behavior (such as dressing inappropriately or crying frequently) or catatonic behavior (or being in a daze)   #Negative symptoms, such as a lack of or decline in emotional response, speech, or motivation   #: If the delusions are bizarre, or if the person hears one imaginary voice making a running commentary of the person's actions or hears two or more voices talking with each other, then only that symptom (delusions or hallucinations) is required.
Schizophrenia;60;The speech disorganization criterion is met only if it is severe enough to affect communication negatively and substantially.
Schizophrenia;61;Social or work problems: For a significant portion of the time since symptoms began, one or more major areas of functioning, such as work, relationships, or self-care, are markedly below the level that the person achieved before.
Schizophrenia;62;Significant duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months.
Schizophrenia;63;This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment).
Schizophrenia;64;Subtypes   The DSM-IV-TR contains five subtypes of schizophrenia, although the developers of the next version of the DSM, DSM-5, recommend that these subtypes be dropped:   Paranoid subtype: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present.
Schizophrenia;65;However, thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or lack of emotional response are not present.
Schizophrenia;66;Delusions involve imagining that someone wants to harm the person or are very complex.
Schizophrenia;67;Other themes, such as envy, extreme religious beliefs, or physical complaints, might also be present (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0).
Schizophrenia;68;Disorganized subtype: This subtype is named “hebephrenic schizophrenia” in the ICD.
Schizophrenia;69;Thought disorder and lack of emotional responsiveness are both present (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1).
Schizophrenia;70;Catatonic subtype: The person might be almost immobile or might exhibit restless, purposeless movement.
Schizophrenia;71;Symptoms can include acting as though one is in a daze.
Schizophrenia;72;Or, one might passively allow others to pose one’s limbs and then stay in that position (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2).
Schizophrenia;73;Undifferentiated subtype: Serious mental symptoms are present, but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types are not met (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3).
Schizophrenia;74;Residual subtype: Positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5).
Schizophrenia;75;The ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes:   Post-schizophrenic depression: People might have some minor schizophrenic symptoms and have depression after one of the five subtypes.
Schizophrenia;76;(ICD code F20.4).
Schizophrenia;77;Simple schizophrenia: Strong negative symptoms increase slowly over time, with no history of episodes of serious mental illness (ICD code F20.6).
Schizophrenia;78;There are various medical conditions, other psychiatric conditions and drug abuse related reactions that may mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia (meaning they have some or all of the same symptoms).
Schizophrenia;79;For example, delirium can cause visual hallucinations, or an unpredictable changing levels of consciousness.
Schizophrenia;80;Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a disorder in which a person becomes obsessed with certain ideas or actions.
Schizophrenia;81;However, separating the obsessions of OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia can be difficult.
Schizophrenia;82;There is no clear evidence that treating schizophrenia with anti-psychotic drugs early is effective.
Schizophrenia;83;The British NICE guidelines recommend cognitive behavioural talk therapy for all people at risk.
Schizophrenia;84;In recent research, 76 patients at risk for schizophrenia were divided into two groups.
Schizophrenia;85;One group got omega3 for 3 months and the other got a dummy pill (food oil).
Schizophrenia;86;After 12 months only 4.9% of the omega 3 group had got schizophrenia compared to 27.5% in the other group.
Schizophrenia;87;There is some evidence which shows that early treatment with drugs improves short term outcomes for people who have a serious episode of mental illness.
Schizophrenia;88;These measures show little benefit five years later.
Schizophrenia;89;Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pre-onset phase with anti-psychotic drugs is of uncertain benefit and so is not recommended (as of 2009).
Schizophrenia;90;Prevention is difficult because there is no reliable way to find out in advance who will get schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;91;The treatment of schizophrenia is based upon the phase of the illness the person is in.
Schizophrenia;92;There are three treatment phases:   Acute Phase   The goals of treatment during the acute phase of treatment, defined by an acute psychotic episode, are to prevent harm, control disturbed behavior, reduce the severity of psychosis and associated symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression, negative symptoms, affective symptoms), determine and address the factors that led to the occurrence of the acute episode, effect a rapid return to the best level of functioning, develop an alliance with the patient and family, formulate short- and long-term treatment plans, and connect the patient with appropriate aftercare in the community   Stabilization Phase   During the stabilization phase, the goals of treatment are to reduce stress on the patient and provide support to minimize the likelihood of relapse, enhance the patient’s adaptation to life in the community, facilitate continued reduction in symptoms and consolidation of remission, and promote the process of recovery.
Schizophrenia;93;If the patient has improved with a particular medication regimen, continuing to use of that regimen and monitoring are recommended for at least 6 months.
Schizophrenia;94;Stable Phase   The goals of treatment during the stable phase are to ensure that symptom remission or control is sustained, that the patient is maintaining or improving his or her level of functioning and quality of life, that increases in symptoms or relapses are effectively treated, and that monitoring for adverse treatment effects continues.
Schizophrenia;95;Regular monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
Schizophrenia;96;For most persons with schizophrenia in the stable phase, psychosocial interventions are recommended as a useful adjunctive treatment to pharmacological treatment and may improve outcomes.
Schizophrenia;97;Antipsychotic medications substantially reduce the risk of relapse in the stable phase of illness and are strongly recommended.
Schizophrenia;98;The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can reduce the positive symptoms in about seven to fourteen days.
Schizophrenia;99;However, medication fails to improve negative symptoms or problems in thinking significantly.
Schizophrenia;100;Many antipsychotics are Dopamine antagonists (a substance interfering with how another substance works.)
Schizophrenia;101;High concentrations of Dopamine are thought to be the cause of hallucinations and delusions.
Schizophrenia;102;For this reason blocking Dopamine reception helps against hallucinations and delusions.
Schizophrenia;103;The British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) suggest checking for reactions to traumatic experiences, deciding together with a doctor about using medication, taking into account the side effect risks of getting diabetes, becoming seriously overweight, getting brain damage (tardive dyskinesia, 5% risk per year), men growing breasts, and feelings described as inner torture (akathesia).
Schizophrenia;104;The guidelines warn against using more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time.
Schizophrenia;105;Some reviews of research sponsored by the makers of antipsychotic drugs claim that about 40 to 50 percent of people have a good response to medication, 30 to 40 percent have a partial response, and 20 percent have an unsatisfactory response (after 6 weeks on two or three different drugs).
Schizophrenia;106;"Other research from The British Journal of Psychiatry were more negative and claimed that "" the clinical relevance of antipsychotics is in fact limited "" ."
Schizophrenia;107;This study included 22 428 patients and 11 antipsychotic drugs.
Schizophrenia;108;A drug called clozapine is an effective treatment for people who respond poorly to other drugs, but clozapine can lower the white blood cell count in 1 to 4 percent of people who take it.
Schizophrenia;109;This is a serious side effect.
Schizophrenia;110;For people who are unwilling or unable to take drugs regularly, injectable long-acting preparations of antipsychotics can be used.
Schizophrenia;111;When used in combination with mental and social interventions (treatment), such preparations can help people to continue their treatment.
Schizophrenia;112;Numerous mental and social interventions can be useful in treating schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;113;Such interventions include various types of therapy, community-based treatments, supported employment, skills training, token economic interventions, and mental interventions for drug or alcohol use and weight management.
Schizophrenia;114;Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, might reduce a return of symptoms or the need for hospitalizations (having to go into hospital.)
Schizophrenia;115;There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (also known as “talk therapy”) .
Schizophrenia;116;The British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) recommend for both people are at risk of getting schizophrenia and people who have got it, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy.
Schizophrenia;117;Getting support from people who have become well from schizophrenia is also strongly recommended.
Schizophrenia;118;In a family oriented treatment program in Finland, Open Dialog, 8 out of 10 people with schizophrenia get well with no medication or very limited drug use, often only anxiety medication.
Schizophrenia;119;Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs.
Schizophrenia;120;The condition results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 to 15 years, primarily because of its association with being overweight, not exercising, and smoking cigarettes.
Schizophrenia;121;An increased rate of suicide (a person killing themself) plays a lesser role.
Schizophrenia;122;These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.
Schizophrenia;123;Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability, with active psychosis ranked as the third-most-disabling condition.
Schizophrenia;124;Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have an ongoing disability with symptoms that keep coming back.
Schizophrenia;125;Some people do recover completely and others function well in society.
Schizophrenia;126;Most people with schizophrenia live independently, with community support.
Schizophrenia;127;In people with a first episode of serious mental symptoms, 42 percent have a good long-term outcome, 35 percent have an intermediate outcome and 27 percent have a poor outcome.
Schizophrenia;128;Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing world than in the developed world, although that conclusion has been questioned.
Schizophrenia;129;The suicide rate of people who have schizophrenia is estimated to be about 4.9 percent, most often occurring in the period following the first appearance of symptoms or the first hospital admission.
Schizophrenia;130;20 to 40 percent try to kill themselves at least once.
Schizophrenia;131;Schizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies worldwide.
Schizophrenia;132;Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals who have schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent of these people being regular smokers, compared to 20 percent of the general population.
Schizophrenia;133;Those individuals who smoke tend to smoke heavily and to smoke cigarettes with a high nicotine content.
Schizophrenia;134;Research continues on schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;135;In the spring of 2013, genetics associations were shown between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia per recent study.
Schizophrenia;136;"In the summer of 2013, for the first time, brain tissue development was replicated in three dimensions by scientists cloning a human "" mini-brain "" using stem cells."
Schizophrenia;137;This could help with schizophrenia and autism neurological research (research related to the brain.)
Schizophrenia;138;As of 2011, schizophrenia affects around 0.3% to 0.7% of people, or 24 million people worldwide, at some point in their lives.
Schizophrenia;139;More men are affected than women: the number of males with the disorder is 1.4 times greater than that of females.
Schizophrenia;140;Schizophrenia usually appears earlier in men.
Schizophrenia;141;For males the symptoms usually start from 20 to 28 years of age, and in females it is 26 to 32 years of age.
Schizophrenia;142;Symptoms that start in childhood, middle or old age are much rarer.
Schizophrenia;143;Despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide, its rate of likelihood varies across the world, within countries, and at the local level.
Schizophrenia;144;The disorder causes approximately 1% of worldwide disability adjusted life years (in other words, years spent with a disability).
Schizophrenia;145;The rate of schizophrenia varies depending on how it is defined.
Schizophrenia;146;Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome are rare before the 19th century.
Schizophrenia;147;Detailed case reports from 1797 and 1809, are regarded as the earliest cases of the disorder.
Schizophrenia;148;Schizophrenia was first described as a distinct syndrome affecting teenagers and young adults by Bénédict Morel in 1853, termed démence précoce (literally 'early dementia').
Schizophrenia;149;The term dementia praecox was used in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder.
Schizophrenia;150;In 1893 Emil Kraepelin introduced a new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression).
Schizophrenia;151;Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was primarily a disease of the brain, and a form of dementia, different from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which usually happen later in life.
Schizophrenia;152;"Eugen Bleuler coined the term ”schizophrenia”, which translates roughly as "" split mind "" , in 1908."
Schizophrenia;153;The word was intended to describe the separation of functioning between personality, thinking, memory, and perception.
Schizophrenia;154;Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia because some of his patients improved rather than got worse.
Schizophrenia;155;In the early 1970s, the criteria for determining schizophrenia were the subject of numerous controversies.
Schizophrenia;156;Schizophrenia was diagnosed far more often in the United States than in Europe.
Schizophrenia;157;This difference was partly the result of looser criteria for determining whether someone had the condition in the United States, where the DSM-II manual was used.
Schizophrenia;158;In Europe, the ICD-9 manual was used.
Schizophrenia;159;A 1972 study, published in the journal Science, concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States was often unreliable.
Schizophrenia;160;These factors resulted in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980 with a stricter and more defined criteria for the diagnosis.
Schizophrenia;161;Negative social judgment has been identified as a major obstacle in the recovery of people who have schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;162;In 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from “Seishin-Bunretsu-Byō”　精神分裂病 (“mind-split-disease”) to “Tōgō-shitchō-shō”　統合失調症 (“integration disorder”), in an attempt to reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment.
Schizophrenia;163;The idea that the disease is caused by multiple factors (not just one mental cause) inspired the new name.
Schizophrenia;164;The change increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 percent to 70 percent over three years.
Schizophrenia;165;In the United States in 2002, the cost of schizophrenia, including direct costs (people who were not hospitalized, people who were hospitalized, medicines, and long-term care) and non-healthcare costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment), was estimated to be $62.7 billion.
Schizophrenia;166;The book “A Beautiful Mind” and the film of the same name are about the life of John Forbes Nash, an American mathematician and Nobel Prize winner who has schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia;167;The movie “The Soloist” is based on the life of Nathaniel Ayers, a gifted musician who dropped out of the Julliard School, in New York City after the symptoms of schizophrenia began.
Schizophrenia;168;He later became homeless in Los Angeles, California, in the notorious Skid Row section.
Rickets;1;Rickets is a disease that happens in young children.
Rickets;2;It happens in children who do not get enough vitamin D and calcium.
Rickets;3;It causes larger spaces inside bones, and makes them dry, like sponges.
Rickets;4;It can make the legs curve toward each other (so the knees touch) or away from each other.
Rickets;5;Rickets in adults is called osteomalacia.
Rickets;6;"The word "" rickets "" comes from the Greek word rhakhis, which means "" spine. """
Rickets;7;People need both vitamin D and calcium to make their bones strong.
Rickets;8;Vitamin D helps the bones absorb (take up) calcium.
Rickets;9;Low vitamin D makes it hard to absorb calcium.
Rickets;10;The human body makes vitamin D  in the skin, from cholesterol.
Rickets;11;Then the liver changes vitamin D  into calcitriol, which sends calcium from the blood into the bones.
Rickets;12;The bones need calcium to stay strong.
Rickets;13;However, the skin will not make vitamin D  unless enough ultraviolet light shines on it.
Rickets;14;Sunlight contains ultraviolet light, so getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D  .
Rickets;15;People need calcium for calcification.
Rickets;16;Calcification uses calcium to help make bones bigger and stronger.
Rickets;17;Low calcium makes bones delicate and easier to break.
Rickets;18;Rickets can be prevented if a person gets plenty of calcium and vitamin D.   The best way to do this is to get a lot of sunlight, and eat foods that have a lot of vitamin D and calcium in them.
Rickets;19;However, people who cannot get enough vitamin D and calcium this way can take supplements (vitamin pills that have calcium and vitamin D in them).
Rickets;20;"Foods that have a lot of calcium in them include:   Milk and other dairy products like cheeses   Some green vegetables, like broccoli, spinach, and kale   Today, many products are "" fortified "" with vitamin D: the vitamin was added when the food was made."
Rickets;21;These foods include some kinds of orange juice, breakfast cereals, breads, and even bottled water.
Rickets;22;The food's label will say how much calcium it has in it.
Rickets;23;Calcium is absorbed best by the bones when it is taken in amounts of 500 600 grams or less.
Rickets;24;Because of this, doctors suggest eating smaller amounts of foods with calcium in them, at different times in the day, instead of all at once.
Rickets;25;There are three ways to get vitamin D: sunlight, foods, or supplements (vitamin pills that have vitamin D in them).
Rickets;26;However, many people cannot get enough vitamin D just from their diet.
Rickets;27;There only a few foods that have a lot of vitamin D in them.
Rickets;28;"They include:   "" Fatty fish "" that were caught in the wild, like mackerel, salmon, and tuna   Cooked egg yolk   Vitamin D is added to some foods, like some kinds of dairy products, cereals, and orange juices   Breast milk may not have enough vitamin D in it to prevent rickets."
Rickets;29;Babies who are only breastfed, and not fed any other foods, may be given vitamin D drops to make sure they do not get rickets.
Rickets;30;However, this is not a significant risk if mothers and child have some exposure to sunlight.
Rickets;31;Children with dark skin are more likely to need additional vitamin D.   These things make a person more likely to get rickets:   They are between three and 36 months old.
Rickets;32;Children this age are at the greatest risk for rickets because their bones are growing so quickly, and are supposed to get bigger and stronger during this time   They were born prematurely (earlier than normal)   They live in the Northern parts of the world, where there is less sunshine   They spend too little time outside   They always wear sunscreen when going out   Even mild sunscreen decreases the amount of vitamin D the body makes by 95% (by stopping the body from taking in vitamin D from sunlight)   However, people should still wear sunscreen when they might get sunburned   They do not eat enough food that has calcium or vitamin D in it, because of lactose intolerance or a strict vegetarian diet   They cannot make or use vitamin D because of a medical disorder, like coeliac disease, or because they take certain anti-seizure medications   Signs and symptoms of rickets include:   Brittle (easily broken) bones or teeth   Bleeding more than normal   Stunted growth (not growing like a healthy child would)   Sweating   Weakness (feeling tired all the time)   Body pain   Vitamin D   Calcium
Acne;1;Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands.
Acne;2;"The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris, which means "" common acne "" ."
Acne;3;The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection.
Acne;4;Oils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles.
Acne;5;Under the blocked pore, oil builds up.
Acne;6;Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly.
Acne;7;This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible.
Acne;8;The face, chest, back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen.
Acne;9;Acne is common during puberty, when a person is turning from a child into an adult, because of high levels of hormones.
Acne;10;Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood.
Acne;11;There are lots of acne treatment methods available, including natural treatments.
Acne;12;People of all ages can get acne, although it occurs more commonly in adolescents.
Acne;13;Acne can affect people physically, psychologically, and socially.
Acne;14;Acne causes scarring, and acne pustules can be very painful and sensitive.
Acne;15;People suffering from a bad case of acne, especially adolescents, can develop low self-esteem which can lead to depression.
Acne;16;Low self-esteem issues can make a person suffering from acne withdraw from many social events.
Acne;17;It makes developing new personal relationships (especially love relationships) more difficult.
Acne;18;Low self-esteem can also cause problems with career advancement as the person may find it difficult to present a positive attitude.
Acne;19;This may sometimes even lead to suicide.
Acne;20;Exactly why some people get acne and some do not is not completely known.
Acne;21;These can cause acne, or make it worse:   Hormonal fluctuation   Hyperactive sebaceous glands   Stress   Many dead skin cells staying on the skin   Bacteria in the pores   Diet   Aspirin reduces inflammation which in result, reduces facial redness due to acne.
Acne;22;Many things are sold to treat acne, the most popular being benzoyl peroxide.
Acne;23;Many of these things have not been scientifically proven to help acne.
Acne;24;However, a mix of commercial and homemade treatments can help with acne for various reasons.
Acne;25;Killing the bacteria that grow in the blocked follicles.
Acne;26;This can be done by ingesting antibiotic medication, or by putting antibiotics on the skin.
Acne;27;Antibiotics act quickly and are a powerful way of temporarily getting rid of acne.
Acne;28;When the body develops a resistance to the antibiotics, the bacteria returns stronger than before.
Acne;29;Removing oil on the skin can be done by taking drugs that contain Vitamin A. Accutane is the name of the most famous treatment using massive quantities of Vitamin A.
Acne;30;Removing dead skin cells can be done by treatment with salicylic acid.
Acne;31;This encourages the skin to peel away the top layer of cells.
Acne;32;Diet: studies have shown that acne is quite rare in areas with different diets, and particular food items have been shown to exacerbate acne.
Acne;33;Popping a pimple should not be done by anyone but a qualified dermatologist.
Acne;34;Pimple popping irritates skin, can make the bacteria spread, and can cause scars.
Acne;35;If you must pop a pimple yourself, it is advised to apply warm water to the area before popping it and to wash your hand thoroughly before beginning so as to avoid spreading bacteria via the hands.
Acne;36;Applying hot water will open up the pores and reduce the damage because it will require less force to pop it.
Acne;37;There are 650 million people in the world with acne, which is around 9.4% of the global population.
Acne;38;More females are getting acne than males (9.8% versus 9.0%).
Acne;39;Acne affects 40 to 50 million people in the United States (16%) and approximately 3 to 5 million in Australia (23%).
Acne;40;Acne affects people of all ethnic groups.
Acne;41;Bad acne often leads to bad scars where the skin has the shape of a volcano.
Acne;42;It is difficult and expensive to treat acne scars.
Acne;43;These are some ways acne scars can be treated:   Dermabrasion.
Acne;44;The top layer of the skin is taken away to make the scar look less deep.
Acne;45;It makes the scar less visible, but does not remove it completely.
Acne;46;Many treatments may be needed.
Acne;47;Laser resurfacing.
Acne;48;A laser is used to burn off the top layer of the skin.
Acne;49;Deep penetrating light therapy.
Acne;50;A non-laser, non-ultraviolet light therapy that can be used to improve mild to moderate acne.
Acne;51;A blue light causes the breakdown of certain chemicals within the acne bacteria, destroying the cell walls.
Acne;52;Punch excision.
Acne;53;The scar is raised with a punch tool and the edges are smoothed together.
Acne;54;Chemical peels.
Acne;55;Different types of acid are put on the skin so that a smoother layer can form.
Acne;57;A hole is made between the scar and the skin under the scar.
Acne;58;Blood can pool under the scar, and raise it to the surface of the skin.
Acne;59;Questions and Answers About Acne, from the U.S. National Institutes of Health
Tuberculosis;1;Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria.
Tuberculosis;2;In the past, people called it consumption.
Tuberculosis;3;TB is caused by several types of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis;4;The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.
Tuberculosis;5;The bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next.
Tuberculosis;6;This happens when infected people cough, sneeze, or spit.
Tuberculosis;7;Of every 100 people with TB, between five and ten people show symptoms.
Tuberculosis;8;In these people, the disease is called active.
Tuberculosis;9;Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment.
Tuberculosis;10;Diagnosis of active TB relies on radiology.
Tuberculosis;11;Doctors often look at an X-ray of the chest.
Tuberculosis;12;In addition, they check body fluids.
Tuberculosis;13;These fluids have microbes in them, which are grown in cell cultures.
Tuberculosis;14;The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB.
Tuberculosis;15;If the patient has TB, but does not show symptoms, the disease is 'latent'.
Tuberculosis;16;Doctors use a skin test, called the Mantoux test, to detect latent TB.
Tuberculosis;17;They often do blood tests too.
Tuberculosis;18;There is a vaccine against some forms of tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis;19;"It is called bacillus Calmette & ndash;Guérin vaccine."
Tuberculosis;20;TB used to be easily treated and cured with antibiotics.
Tuberculosis;21;However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics.
Tuberculosis;22;This resistance makes treatment difficult.
Tuberculosis;23;Many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time.
Tuberculosis;24;There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to all drugs.
Tuberculosis;25;Tuberculosis can have many symptoms.
Tuberculosis;26;The most common include:   A cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis)   Chest pain   Not having any appetite   Weakness   Weight loss   Chills   Very pale skin   Listless eyes   Fever   Sweating a lot at night   Difficulty breathing   Feeling very tired   People are also more likely to get tuberculosis if they live close to other people who have TB.
Tuberculosis;27;For example, TB can spread easily in homeless shelters, prisons, and immigrant communities.
Tuberculosis;28;Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with M. tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis;29;New infections occur at a rate of one per second.
Tuberculosis;30;In 2007, about 13.7 million chronic cases were active globally.
Tuberculosis;31;In 2010, about 8.8 million new cases developed and nearly 1.5 million people died from the disease, most of them in developing countries.
Tuberculosis;32;The number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002.
Tuberculosis;33;Tuberculosis does not happen at the same rate around the world.
Tuberculosis;34;About eighty percent of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive for TB, but only five to ten percent of people in the United States do.
Tuberculosis;35;People usually get tuberculosis because of a weakened immune system.
Tuberculosis;36;Many people with HIV and AIDS can also get tuberculosis.

Cancer;1;Cancer is a type of disease where cells grow out of control, divide and invade other tissues.
Cancer;2;Hippocrates later added -oma (Greek for 'swelling') after the word 'carcinos'.
Cancer;3;Another very early type of surgery used to treat cancer was written about in the 1020s.
Cancer;4;In The Canon of Medicine, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) said that treatment should involve cutting out all diseased tissue.
Cancer;5;This included the use of amputation (removing a part of the body completely) or removing veins that ran in the direction of the tumor.
Cancer;6;Avicenna also suggested that the area that had been treated should be cauterized (or burned) if needed.
Cancer;7;In the 16th and 17th centuries (the 1500s and 1600s), doctors started to be allowed to dissect bodies (or cut them open after death) in order to figure out the cause of death.
Cancer;8;Around this time, there were many different ideas about what caused cancer.
Cancer;9;The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a clot of milk in the part of a woman's breast that produces milk.
Cancer;10;The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius believed that all disease was caused by chemical processes.
Cancer;11;He thought that cancer, in particular, was caused by acidic lymph.
Cancer;12;Nicolaes Tulp, who lived at the same time as Sylvius, believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and was contagious.
Cancer;13;A British surgeon named Percivall Pott was the first person to figure out one of the real causes of cancer.
Cancer;14;In 1775, he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps (people who cleaned out chimneys).
Cancer;15;Other doctors started studying this topic and coming up with other ideas about what causes cancer.
Cancer;16;Doctors then started working together and coming up with better ideas.
Cancer;17;In the 18th century (the 1700s), many people started to use the microscope, and this made a big difference in helping doctors and scientists understand more about cancer.
Cancer;18;"Using the microscope, scientists were able to see that the 'cancer poison' spread from one tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ( "" metastasis "" )."
Cancer;19;This was first made clear by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan, between 1871 and 1874.
Cancer;20;Before the 19th century (the 1800s), using surgery to treat cancer usually had bad results.
Cancer;21;Doctors did not understand how important hygiene (or keeping things clean) is for preventing disease, especially after surgery.
Cancer;22;Because things were not kept clean during or after surgery, patients often got infections and died.
Cancer;23;For example, one well-known Scottish surgeon, Alexander Monro, kept records and found that 58 patients out of every 60 who had surgery for breast tumors died within the next two years.
Cancer;24;In the 19th century, surgical hygiene got better because of asepsis.
Cancer;25;Doctors realized that dirtiness and germs cause infections, so they started to keep things cleaner and do things to kill germs in order to prevent their patients from getting infections.
Cancer;26;It became more common for people to survive after having surgery.
Cancer;27;Surgical removal of the tumor (taking the tumor out of the body by doing surgery) became the first-choice treatment for cancer.
Cancer;28;For this kind of treatment to work, the surgeon doing the operation had to be very good at removing tumors.
Cancer;29;(This meant that even if people had the same kind of cancer, they could get very different results, with some getting good treatment that worked and others getting treatment that did not work, because of differences in how good different surgeons were.)
Cancer;30;In the late 1800s, doctors and scientists started to realize that the body is made up of many kinds of tissues, which in turn are made up of millions of cells.
Cancer;31;The discovery started the age of cellular pathology (studying cells to learn about diseases and figure out what is wrong with the body).
Cancer;32;In the 1890s, French scientists discovered radioactive decay.
Cancer;33;Radiation therapy became the first cancer treatment that worked and did not involve surgery.
Cancer;34;It required a new multi-disciplinary approach to cancer treatment (people doing different jobs were working together to treat patients).
Cancer;35;The surgeon was no longer working by himself - he worked together with hospital radiologists (people who gave and read X-rays) to help patients.
Cancer;36;This team approach meant changes in how they worked.
Cancer;37;The different people on the team had to communicate with each other and work together, which they were not used to doing.
Cancer;38;It also meant that treatment had to be done in a hospital rather than at the patient's home.
Cancer;39;"Because of this, patients' information had to be put together into files kept at the hospital (called "" medical records "" )."
Cancer;40;Because this information was now being kept and written down, scientists were able to do the first statistical patient studies using numbers to study questions like how many people who have a certain type of cancer or get a certain treatment survive.
Cancer;41;Another important step forward in understanding cancer happened in 1926, when Janet Lane-Claypon published a paper on cancer epidemiology.
Cancer;42;(Epidemiology is a field of study which looks at how common a disease is, what patterns the disease takes in different kinds of people, and what this means for understanding and treating the disease.)
Cancer;43;This historic paper was a comparative study, which tries to find out what causes a disease by looking at a group of people who have the disease and figuring out how they are different from another group that does not have the disease.
Cancer;44;Lane-Clayton's study looked at 1000 people who all had the same background and lifestyle (or way of living): 500 people with breast cancer and 500 control patients (people without breast cancer).
Cancer;45;These people were the same in many ways, but some got breast cancer and some did not.
Cancer;46;To figure out what might be causing certain people to get breast cancer, the study looked at what was different about these people when they were compared to (or looked at alongside) the people who did not get cancer.
Cancer;47;Lane-Clayton's study was published by the British Ministry of Health.
Cancer;48;Her work on cancer epidemiology was continued by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill.
Cancer;49;They used the same ways of studying cancer as Lane-Clayton, but they looked at a different kind of cancer: lung cancer.
Cancer;50;"In 1956, they published their results in a paper called "" Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking."
Cancer;51;"A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors "" (also called the British doctors study)."
Cancer;52;Later, Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center (MRC), and started the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968.
Cancer;53;By using computers, this unit was able to do something new and very important: it brought together large amounts of cancer data (pieces of information about cancer).
Cancer;54;This way of studying cancer is very important to cancer epidemiology today, and it has also been very important in shaping what we now know about cancer and what the rules and laws about the disease and public health are today.
Cancer;55;Over the past 50 years, many different people have done a lot of work to collect data from different doctors, hospitals, areas, states, and even countries.
Cancer;56;This data is used to study whether different kinds of cancer are more or less common in different areas, environments (for example, in big cities compared to the countryside), or cultures.
Cancer;57;This helps people who study cancer to figure out what makes people more or less likely to get different kinds of cancer.
Cancer;58;Before World War II, doctors and hospitals were getting better at collecting (or getting and keeping) data about their patients who had cancer, but it was rare for this data to be shared with other doctors or hospitals.
Cancer;59;This changed after WWII, when medical research centers found out that different countries had very different number of cases of cancer.
Cancer;60;Because of this, many countries created national public health organizations (which studied public health issues in an entire country).
Cancer;61;These national public health organizations began to bring together health data from many different doctors and hospitals.
Cancer;62;This helped them figure out some of the reasons why cancer was so much more common in certain places.
Cancer;63;For example, in Japan, people studying cancer found out that people who had survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had bone marrow that was completely destroyed.
Cancer;64;This helped them realize that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation, which was a very important step in figuring out that leukemia (a blood cancer) can be treated with bone marrow transplants.
Cancer;65;Since World War II, scientists have kept finding better cancer treatments.
Cancer;66;However, there are some things that still need to get better.
Cancer;67;For example, while there are good treatments for many kinds of cancer, there are still no treatments for certain kinds of cancer, or for some cancers once they progress (or get worse) to a certain stage of the disease.
Cancer;68;Also, the cancer treatments that do exist are not all standardized (there is not one agreed-upon way of giving every treatment which is used each time the treatment is given).
Cancer;69;Cancer treatments are also not available everywhere in the world.
Cancer;70;People need to keep studying cancer epidemiology and forming international partnerships (where different countries work together) to find cures and make cancer treatments available everywhere.
Cancer;71;What is Cancer?

Starvation;1;Starvation is when a person or animal has not eaten food for such a time that they are unable to do things in a normal way.
Starvation;2;After the stomach has been left empty for so long the body starts to give up.
Starvation;3;There are many effects of starvation.
Starvation;4;These can include:   Tiredness,   a swollen stomach caused by kwashiorkor,   loss of weight,   weakness and not being able to stand   The metabolism naturally lowers when a person is starved.
Starvation;5;This makes weight loss slower.
Starvation;6;Consistently not being able to eat enough will lead to permanent damage to the organs.
Starvation;7;This is the case for humans when they do not eat enough for about 1-2 months.
Starvation;8;A process called catabolysis will break down body tissues, using them as fuel to keep vital functions (the nervous system and the heart) working.
Starvation;9;It will first use muscles before it starts destroying fat.
Starvation;10;Starvation was also used to inflict a death penalty.
Starvation;11;People who eat nothing usually die in a few months.
Starvation;12;In 1944 Ancel Keys started a scientific experiment about starvation.
Starvation;13;The participants were all men.
Starvation;14;They ate 1800 calories a day.
Starvation;15;Hunger   Global Hunger Index   Malnutrition   Anorexia nervosa
Kwashiorkor;1;Kwashiorkor is a health condition of poor nutrition from not having enough protein in the diet.
Kwashiorkor;2;If a person uses up energy from carbohydrates (starches) and lipids (fats), their body may begin to use protein for energy.
Kwashiorkor;3;The body breaks down protein into energy that can be used.
Kwashiorkor;4;They then do not have enough protein for other needed bodily functions such as growth and building tissues like bones.
Kwashiorkor;5;Usually this is a condition of children from aged 1 to 5 years, but rarely adults and older children get it.
Kwashiorkor;6;It is common in poor places in Africa.
Kwashiorkor;7;Symptoms include having a pot belly, swollen face, and hair that is dark then light then dark.
Kwashiorkor;8;This can be cured by having a protein- rich diet.
Kwashiorkor;9;Kwashiorkor comes from a protein deficiency (lack) in the diet.
Kwashiorkor;10;Body parts becomes swollen due to an accumulation of water in the spaces between the body's cells.
Kwashiorkor;11;Other symptoms are poor muscle development, swollen legs, puffy face, difficulty in eating, diarrhea, and dry skin are the symptoms of this disease.
Psoriasis;1;Psoriasis is a skin condition where cells grow at a faster rate than they can be shed, causing excess skin to build up and form scaly patches on the body.
Psoriasis;2;The condition:   It appears to be a buildup of dry skin on your body.
Psoriasis;3;You can have it at any age, but normally as you get older.
Psoriasis;4;It starts with the skin cracking as a paper cut on your fingertips.
Psoriasis;5;This skin would begin to die, flake, peal and itch.
Psoriasis;6;As your itch the area, it begins to get red and then it begins to blister like, flake and peals to raw skin.
Psoriasis;7;It appears most often on hands, toes, inside arch of your feet and on you heals.
Psoriasis;8;It is also shows up in callus, by cracking.
Psoriasis;9;When washing hands it has a burning effect.
Psoriasis;10;Living in moist humid climate appears to delay the condition for appearing.
Psoriasis;11;Dry arid climates seem to aggravate the condition.
Psoriasis;12;Washing your hands has a drying affect, which triggers the condition.
Psoriasis;13;When washing, water removes oils from our body, and has a drying effect on our hands.
Psoriasis;14;Washing with Psoriasis removes the dry skin, but then the skin underneath is raw.
Psoriasis;15;Hard water appears to worsen the condition in dry climates, but not as much in humid areas.
Psoriasis;16;Soft water appears better.
Synesthesia;1;Synesthesia, or synaesthesia, is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses.
Synesthesia;2;People who have synesthesia are called synesthetes.
Synesthesia;3;Synesthesia is usually inherited (called congenital synesthesia), but exactly how people inherit it is unknown.
Synesthesia;4;Synesthesia is sometimes reported by people using psychedelic drugs, after a stroke, or during an epileptic seizure.
Synesthesia;5;It is also reported to be a result of blindness or deafness.
Synesthesia;6;Synesthesia that comes from events unrelated to genes is called adventitious synesthesia.
Synesthesia;7;This synesthesia results from some drugs or a stroke but not blindness or deafness.
Synesthesia;8;It involves sound being linked to vision or touch being linked to hearing.
Synesthesia;9;Synesthesia was investigated a lot in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but in the middle of the 20th century, it was less studied.
Synesthesia;10;Only recently has it been studied again in much detail.
Synesthesia;11;"Some musicians and composers have a form of synesthesia that allows them to "" see "" music as colors or shapes."
Synesthesia;12;This is called chromethesia.
Synesthesia;13;Mozart is said to have had this form of synesthesia.
Synesthesia;14;"He said that the key of D major had a warm "" orangey "" sound to it, while B-flat minor was blackish."
Synesthesia;15;A major was a rainbow of colors to him.
Synesthesia;16;This may explain why he wrote some of his music using different colors for different music notes, and why much of his music is in major keys.
Synesthesia;17;Another composer who had color-hearing was the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin.
Synesthesia;18;In 1907, he talked with another famous composer, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, who had synesthesia, and they both found that some musical notes made them think of certain colors.
Synesthesia;19;Scriabin worked with a man named Alexander Mozer who made a color organ.
Synesthesia;20;The same type of synesthesia may have different effects (pronounced and less pronounced) on different people.
Synesthesia;21;Synesthetes often say that they did not know their experiences were unusual until they found out that other people did not have them.
Synesthesia;22;Others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives.
Synesthesia;23;"Most synesthetes consider their experiences a gift—a "" hidden "" sense."
Synesthesia;24;Most synesthetes find out in their childhood that they have synethesia.
Synesthesia;25;Some learn to apply it in daily life and work.
Synesthesia;26;For example, they might use their gift to memorize names and telephone numbers or do mental arithmetic.
Synesthesia;27;Many people with synesthesia use their experiences to help them be more creative, for example, in making drawings and music.
Synesthesia;28;More than 60 types of synesthesia have been reported, but only a small number have been studied by scientists.
Synesthesia;29;Some common types of synthesia include:   Grapheme–color synesthesia: Letters or numbers are seen to have colors of their own.
Synesthesia;30;Ordinal linguistic personification: Numbers, days of the week, and months of the year are felt to have their own personalities.
Synesthesia;31;Spatial-sequence: Numbers, months of the year, and/or days of the week are located in specific places in space.
Synesthesia;32;"For example, 1980 may be "" farther away "" than 1990."
Synesthesia;33;Or a year may be seen three-dimensionally as a map.
Synesthesia;34;Visual motion → sound synesthesia: Hearing sounds in response to seeing motion.
Autism;1;Autism is the name of a disorder affecting brain development.
Autism;2;It is one of a group of disorders called autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Autism;3;Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and childhood autism are kinds of autism spectrum disorders.
Autism;4;ASD is a condition that affects the way a person relates to their environment.
Autism;5;The word spectrum is used because not all people with autism have the same traits and difficulties.
Autism;6;Some people find interacting more difficult than others.
Autism;7;Autism may be very apparent in someone or they may show no outward signs of it.
Autism;8;The main areas of difficulty are in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests.
Autism;9;In most cases of autism, motor communication {doing things} is affected.
Autism;10;All these signs develop in the child's first two to three years of age.
Autism;11;"People who have autism find it difficult to act in a way that other people think is "" normal "" ."
Autism;12;They may find it difficult to talk to other people and to look at other people.
Autism;13;Some people with autism do not like being touched.
Autism;14;A person who has autism can seem to be turned inwards.
Autism;15;They may talk only to themselves, rock themselves backwards and forwards, and laugh at their own thoughts.
Autism;16;They might not like any type of change and may find it very difficult to learn a new behaviour like using a toilet or going to school.
Autism;17;Autism is caused by the way that the brain develops, both before and after a baby is born.
Autism;18;About one in every 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder.
Autism;19;The word “autism” comes from the Greek word “autos”, meaning “self.” The term describes conditions in which a person is removed from social interaction—hence, an “isolated self”.
Autism;20;"The term "" autism "" was first used by a psychiatrist named Eugen Bleuler in 1911 to describe one group of symptoms of schizophrenia."
Autism;21;Sigmund Freud considered this idea and thought it was related to narcissism.
Autism;22;Three decades later, researchers in the United States began to use the term autism to describe children with emotional or social problems.
Autism;23;Two researchers by the name of Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner were the pioneers of the research study for autism in the 1940s.
Autism;24;In 1943 Leo Kanner (a doctor from Johns Hopkins University) did a study of 11 children.
Autism;25;The children were very intelligent.
Autism;26;He found out that they had difficulties such as changing environments, being sensitive to certain stimuli, having speech problems and allergies to food.
Autism;27;Later he named the children’s condition “early infantile autism”., now called autism.
Autism;28;In 1944 Hans Asperger studied separately a group of children and found very similar conditions.
Autism;29;The children in Hans Asperger's group did not repeat words and they had no speech problems like Kanner's did.
Autism;30;However, the children did have problems with fine motor skills such as holding a pencil.
Autism;31;The children he studied seemed to be clumsier than other children.
Autism;32;They also had “[...] a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest and clumsy movements”.
Autism;33;"Hans Asperger described a "" milder "" form of autism, his discovery is now called Asperger syndrome."
Autism;34;In 1943 and 1949, Kanner described the children he studied in scientific papers.
Autism;35;In these papers, he wrote that he thought the children's parents were not loving them enough.
Autism;36;He wrote that this might be part of the reason why the children had autism.
Autism;37;For example, in 1949 he wrote that the children's parents showed no warmth, or love, to their children.
Autism;38;"He thought the parents were so "" cold "" that he compared them to refrigerators:  This idea became known as the refrigerator mother theory."
Autism;39;For decades parents were blamed for causing their children's autism by not loving their children enough.
Autism;40;By now, we know this is not true.
Autism;41;Schizophrenia and autism were linked in many researchers’ studies.
Autism;42;Only since the 1960s, medical professionals began to have a separate understanding of these two disorders.
Autism;43;Since 1980, Kanner’s so called early infantile autism is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
Autism;44;Precisely because of the vague distinction between schizophrenia and autism, the DSM came out with a more accurate definition of autism in 1987.
Autism;45;Henceforth, early infantile autism is called autism disorder.
Autism;46;Furthermore, for the first time the DSM introduced standardised criteria to diagnose autism.
Autism;47;The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders expanded the definition of autism and included milder cases of autism.
Autism;48;But especially the Asperger’s syndrome was added in 1994.
Autism;49;With the release of the fifth edition of the DSM in 2013 the subtypes of autism are summarized into the general term Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Autism;50;Individuals are now diagnosed on an autism spectrum with varying levels of intensity (mild, moderate and severe).
Autism;51;may like objects over faces as a baby   may not look at faces for more than a second   may prefer being alone, or not interested in making friends   may not react to signs of love e.g.
Autism;52;"hugging   difficulty in knowing how other people feel   laughing or crying at the wrong times   may not talk or communicate much   may speak "" robotically "" (i.e."
Autism;53;with little change in tone or pitch)   difficulty with words that are spelt or sound the same but have different meanings   trouble with understanding gestures or facial expressions   may do the same action repeatedly (stimming)   may have limited interests (referred to as a special interest)   difficulty in coping with changes in routine   Greater sensitivity   Avoiding certain foods because they dislike the textures, or eating things that aren't food   attraction to specific noises   good attention to detail   good balance skills (sometimes)   Different studies resulted in different numbers of the frequency of autism spectrum disorders.
Autism;54;One study stated ten cases of classical autism, 2.5 cases of Asperger's syndrome and 15 cases of mild autism (PDD-NOS) in 10,000 people - tendency: increasing.
Autism;55;Other sources speak about 60 autism spectrum disorder cases in 10,000 people.
Autism;56;However, the number of autism cases is not equal in men and in women.
Autism;57;Here, the results of studies vary highly.
Autism;58;Researchers in general say that 3-4 men are diagnosed for every woman that is diagnosed.
Autism;59;This ratio decreases for severe cases to 1:1.
Autism;60;It increases for high-functioning cases and in Asperger's syndrome reaches a ratio of 8:1.
Autism;61;Recently, the awareness has increased that this ratio may be so high because studies are simply missing female autistic people.
Autism;62;This could be because tests for autism typically focus on male autism traits.
Autism;63;Another possible explanation is that autistic females may be better at adapting to social expectations and hiding their social problems.
Autism;64;Studies have suggested that the brains of autistic females may rather be like neurotypical men’s (non-autistic men) brains of the same age.
Autism;65;These could be reasons why it is not so easy to realise whether a woman is autistic - and therefore, why more men than women are diagnosed.
Autism;66;Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are seen or diagnosed more often in males than females.
Autism;67;The ratio is near one female for every four males diagnosed.
Autism;68;But there is evidence that females may be diagnosed later than males.
Autism;69;Researchers have argued whether there may be a gender bias playing a role in girls and women being underdiagnosed or being diagnosed late.
Autism;70;Although males may have autism spectrum conditions more often, females show different symptoms of autism than males.
Autism;71;Autistic females also have different behaviors.
Autism;72;"Over the past years, individuals have been using the terms "" autism "" and "" autism spectrum disorder "" like they mean the same thing."
Autism;73;Autism is a spectrum disorder.
Autism;74;This means that some people who have autism are only mildly affected.
Autism;75;These people may go to regular schools, go to work, and have partners and families.
Autism;76;Some people are affected worse than others.
Autism;77;These people may be able to take care of most of their own needs at home like dressing and getting food, but not be able to have a regular job or travel alone.
Autism;78;A person who has severe autism may need to be cared for all their life.
Autism;79;Few people with autism are extraordinarily gifted or talented.
Autism;80;These people are said to have savant syndrome.
Autism;81;They are often very good at just one thing in particular, like mathematics, playing the piano or remembering football scores.
Autism;82;The overall category of the Autism Spectrum Disorder is called Pervasive Developmental Disorder.
Autism;83;The name describes medical conditions with developmental problems in a number of fields.
Autism;84;In most cases, when referring to the Autism Spectrum Disorder, we are referring to the most common disorders:   Type of Autism   Childhood Autism   Atypical Autism   Asperger’s Syndrome   ICD-10   F84.0   F84.1   F84.5   Age of onset   Delay or abnormal functioning in communication, language, play and cognitive development before the age of three   Atypical Autism may differ from Childhood Autism in age of onset.
Autism;85;Here, abnormal behaviour is only visible after the age of three.
Autism;86;Additionally, only one or two of the three categories (social interaction, communication and behaviour) are affected   No noticeable delay of communication, language, play or cognitive development during childhood   Interaction   Is affected   Is affected   Communication   Is affected   No delay in language   Behaviour   Is affected   Is affected   The different categories, the so-called “International Classification of Diseases” (ICD), are defined by the World Health Organization.
Autism;87;As shown in the table, the diseases vary in several points.
Autism;88;These are the age of onset, social interaction, communication and behaviour.
Autism;89;An individual belongs to a certain category, depending on the areas of impairment.
Autism;90;All three may seem similar in symptoms, yet are not the same.
Autism;91;Still, people within one group show similar symptoms.
Autism;92;The groups can be used to search for an underlying cause of the disease and to provide a better treatment.
Autism;93;Scientists do not know exactly what causes autism.
Autism;94;There may be many different causes for the different types of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Autism;95;Scientists do know about some things that make a person more likely to have an Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Autism;96;The autism spectrum disorders are highly heritable disorders.
Autism;97;This means that it is very likely (over 90%) that the child of an autistic person will also be on the autism spectrum.
Autism;98;The reason for this are certain genes.
Autism;99;These genes are linked to autism and are passed on from a parent to the child.
Autism;100;Already Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger noticed that fathers of autistic children often preferred being on their own over being with people.
Autism;101;Therefore, Kanner and Asperger suspected a genetic cause.
Autism;102;Studies with families with a child on the autism spectrum were done to investigate this theory.
Autism;103;They found that sometimes the children’s parents (fathers as well as mothers) also show social difficulties, shyness and problems with understanding contextual information when talking to someone.
Autism;104;Some studies have found this in only 10 out of 100 families, some in as much as 45 out of every 100 families.
Autism;105;Other than the studies done on children who had autistic parents, recently a couple of studies were done on children who either had a sibling or a twin showing autistic signs.
Autism;106;Similar to the outcomes in the autistic parents studies, most children having autistic siblings/ twins were found out to be showing autistic signs.
Autism;107;According to a recent study, around fifty percent of infants with autistic siblings showed some kind of atypical behaviour, around one forth of them showed delays and deficits in achieving infancy milestones and around 17% of all were later diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).
Autism;108;Moreover, twin studies showed that it is much more likely that identical twins are both on the autism spectrum than that non-identical twins are both on the autism spectrum.
Autism;109;Identical twins have nearly the same DNA.
Autism;110;Therefore, it is highly probable that they are either both autistic or both not autistic.
Autism;111;Non-identical twins share only half of their genes which makes it less likely that they both have the disorder.
Autism;112;Scientists have shown that the recurrence risk (the likelihood that a child is on the autism spectrum if it has a sister or a brother that is autistic as well) is 20 to 80 times higher than the probability for having the disorder in the average population.
Autism;113;However, it is not a single gene that increases the risk for autism spectrum disorders.
Autism;114;Several genes have been linked to the disorder.
Autism;115;All of the identified genes can in sum only explain one or two out of every ten autism cases.
Autism;116;None of the genes that have been found to play a role in autism can explain more than one out of every 100 cases.
Autism;117;The genetic influences include:   mutations,   genetic syndromes (e.g.
Autism;118;Fragile X syndrome),   de novo (newly occurring in a family) as well as inherited copy number variations (CNV) - a CNV is the duplication or deletion of a gene - and   single nucleotide variants (SNV) - an SNV is a change in one nucleotide that occurs with very low frequency.
Autism;119;The affected genes influence:   the interaction between brain cells and synaptic functioning,   neuronal growth and neuronal migration (the wandering of a neuron from its birthplace to its final location in the brain) and   inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission.
Autism;120;Researchers have not found a single neuronal correlate for autism spectrum disorders, i.e.
Autism;121;no abnormal functioning of the brain is the only cause of autism.
Autism;122;Nevertheless, scientists found some differences between the brains of autistic people and the typical human brain.
Autism;123;These differences lie in the anatomy of the brain, the activity in certain brain regions as well as in the connections between brain regions.
Autism;124;It is a general tendency that autistic people use the same brain regions as other people but show different activity.
Autism;125;In some areas the activity is less, in others it is stronger.
Autism;126;However, this may only be true for male autists.
Autism;127;Throughout the last years, studies have shown that brains of autistic women might be like normal men's brains.
Autism;128;Some researchers grouped autistic people's difficulties into three main areas in order to investigate their neuronal basis.
Autism;129;Researchers say that building a Theory of mind is one of the main problems for autistic people.
Autism;130;This makes it difficult for them to interact with others.
Autism;131;Problems in social interaction are probably worsened by low preference for social stimuli, such as faces.
Autism;132;This tendency has been found in studies tracking the person’s eye movements and in EEG studies.
Autism;133;EEG studies showed lower than normal activity in the fusiform face area (FFA), a brain region that is usually active when seeing faces.
Autism;134;However, the results of other studies could not show this.
Autism;135;Also, scientists measured brain activity of people on the autism spectrum with fMRI while they were thinking about their own emotions.
Autism;136;They found activity in the same brain regions as in non-autistic people.
Autism;137;The difference was that some regions which are important for thinking about oneself and emotions (especially the anterior insula) were less active in autistic people.
Autism;138;Other brain regions were much more active.
Autism;139;These findings may explain the difficulties people with autism experience when trying to understand complex facial expressions and emotions (such as shame, jealousy).
Autism;140;People on the autism spectrum show a lower ability for executive function.
Autism;141;Executive function means physical, emotional and cognitive self-control.
Autism;142;This includes planning actions, focusing, shifting attention and flexibility of behaviour and thinking.
Autism;143;Autistic people's ability can improve but it will remain below non-autistic people's ability in executive function.
Autism;144;Problems with executive function are probably caused by large networks in the brain.
Autism;145;Grey matter and white matter irregularities have a negative influence on the way different brain regions work together (functional integration).
Autism;146;A smaller corpus callosum leads to abnormalities in working memory (an active process of keeping a memory until it is needed) and planning actions.
Autism;147;Central coherence is the ability to build wholes out of parts.
Autism;148;It is weak in people with autism.
Autism;149;This means that autistic people focus more on details.
Autism;150;They cannot build wholes out of them.
Autism;151;Not being able to pay attention to wholes results in difficulties with perception and language.
Autism;152;Therefore, people with autism usually need more time for dealing with information coming from their surroundings.
Autism;153;As a consequence, they typically also need more time for responding.
Autism;154;However, performance varies between people on the autism spectrum.
Autism;155;Moreover, the term central coherence may include many interacting aspects.
Autism;156;This makes it difficult to find the cause for it in the brain.
Autism;157;Neural correlates for central coherence are not yet known.
Autism;158;The risk for autism spectrum disorders can be increased if the mother uses thalidomide, valproic acid or drinks too much alcohol during pregnancy.
Autism;159;The risk for autism also increases with the age of father and mother at the time of pregnancy.
Autism;160;Scientists know that parents do not cause their children's autism by not being loving enough.
Autism;161;Scientists do know for sure that vaccines do not cause autism.
Autism;162;Vaccines do not even make a person more likely to have autism - even if they are already at a high risk for autism before they get their vaccines.
Autism;163;In 1997 A. Wakefield and others found autism signs one month after the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was applied.
Autism;164;They released a paper in which they claimed that autism is caused by the MMR vaccine.
Autism;165;However, the study had several flaws:   they did not exclude children of whom a genetic cause was known,   they did not assess the children's abilities before the vaccine was given,   neuropsychological and endoscopic assessments were not blind,   they did not have control subjects.
Autism;166;Also, no plausible biological mechanism could explain how the MMR vaccine leads to autism.
Autism;167;Since then many case-control studies have been done to investigate the relationship between vaccines and autism.
Autism;168;This means, they compared a group which was vaccinated with a group that was not vaccinated but apart from that identical.
Autism;169;They did not find MMR vaccines to be the cause of autism.
Autism;170;Neither did they find an increased risk for autism by the vaccination.
Autism;171;Parents also worried that thiomersal (US: thimerosal - a substance that makes vaccines and other medicines usable for a longer time) might cause autism because it contains mercury.
Autism;172;No harm from the amount of ethylmercury in vaccines was known.
Autism;173;Yet, vaccines for infants containing mercury were taken from the market.
Autism;174;Nevertheless, thiomersal as a cause for autism is biologically also not biologically.
Autism;175;Mercury poisoning triggers clearly different symptoms than autism.
Autism;176;Still, researchers did studies about this topic.
Autism;177;They did not find a connection between thiomersal and autism.
Autism;178;Finally, a third theory was suggested.
Autism;179;It was stated that many vaccines at the same time would weaken the immune system of infants.
Autism;180;However, autism is not a disorder that is related to the immune system.
Autism;181;Furthermore, single and also many vaccines do not weaken the immune system.
Autism;182;Diagnosing autism is difficult since there is no medical test like a blood test.
Autism;183;Instead, an evaluation is made by a team of doctors and other health professionals who are experienced in autism and know the individual.
Autism;184;A reliable diagnosis can first be given at the age of two.
Autism;185;At the age of 18 and 24 months, children should get a check-up.
Autism;186;If anything wrong is noticed, a further evaluation is done.
Autism;187;In this, a team of professionals will interview the child’s guardians about the child’s behaviour and see what they are like in different settings.
Autism;188;This may also include behavioural or physical assessments as well as intelligence tests or developmental tests.
Autism;189;A good, detailed, history of the child is often very useful in receiving a diagnosis.
Autism;190;Adults can be diagnosed in adults as well as children.
Autism;191;This can be difficult because autism has symptoms that can overlap with other disorders, such as OCD, that may have appeared by adulthood.
Autism;192;An expert will usually ask the adult about concerns, challenges in life (such as socially or behaviourally) as well as standardised testing in these areas.
Autism;193;They also often ask for a developmental history.
Autism;194;In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).
Autism;195;In order to be diagnosed with autism, a person must fulfill two standardized criteria.
Autism;196;It is important that individuals must show symptoms from early childhood, even if those symptoms are recognized later.
Autism;197;These symptoms have to limit everyday functioning.
Autism;198;Additionally, these symptoms cannot be explained by an intellectual disability or a developmental delay.
Autism;199;Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviours.
Autism;200;Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of symptoms, skills and levels of disability.
Autism;201;Some autistic people also have learning disabilities, mental health issues or other conditions.
Autism;202;This means that autism can also co-occur with other conditions and symptoms of the following disorders:   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder   Learning Disability   Intellectual Developmental Disorder   Anxiety Disorder   Intellectual Disability   In the DSM-V, a diagnosis of autism excludes making a formal diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders.
Autism;203;Therefore, other mental health conditions may be undiagnosed in an autistic person, because it is impossible to make a comorbid clinical diagnosis.
Autism;204;Since autism is a spectrum, every person with autism is different.
Autism;205;Different treatments help different people.
Autism;206;There are a few different categories of treatment.
Autism;207;The main ones are medication, different therapies and diets.
Autism;208;The treatment is fitted depending on what a person with autism needs.
Autism;209;It is still unclear what causes autism.
Autism;210;There may be a few causes.
Autism;211;At the moment, it is only possible to lower the symptoms of autism.
Autism;212;A full recovery from autism is not possible.
Autism;213;If therapies cannot reduce the symptoms of autism, medications are used additionally.
Autism;214;Often, several medications are used at the same time to treat different symptoms of autism.
Autism;215;Serotonin is a chemical messenger that transports signals between cells and is very important for normal function, such as with sensory perception, memory, learning and sleep, all of which are impaired in autistic people.
Autism;216;Researchers have not yet found a link between autism and serotonin, although they have been successful in treating autism with SSRIs, which stop cells from absorbing serotonin, meaning more is used for signals.
Autism;217;They can be used to treat repetitive behaviour, aggression, hyperactive behaviour and outbursts of anger.
Autism;218;The SSRIs can have many side-effects.
Autism;219;Usually the medication is better tolerated by adults than by children.
Autism;220;Examples of SSRIs are Clomipramine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Venlafaxine, Trazodone and Mirtazapine.
Autism;221;Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain.
Autism;222;It helps to do movements, release hormones and strengthen cognitive abilities.
Autism;223;Researchers found that increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain will worsen the symptoms of autism.
Autism;224;Substances that help to reduce symptoms of autism are the antipsychotic drugs.
Autism;225;There are two types of antipsychotic medications.
Autism;226;One of the types are typical antipsychotics.
Autism;227;They block the sites where dopamine would bind to a cell.
Autism;228;Atypical antipsychotic drugs on the other hand block the sites where dopamine or serotonin would bind to a cell.
Autism;229;Antipsychotic medicine is the most successful treatment for excitability in autism.
Autism;230;It can also help to reduce aggression, self-injury, hyperactivity and repetitive, although it may have many side-effects.
Autism;231;Originally, antipsychotic medications were used to treat mental disorders like depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
Autism;232;Examples of antipsychotic drugs are Haloperidol, Clozapine, Risperidone and Paliperidone.
Autism;233;In the beginning, psychostimulants were only used for patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Autism;234;Researchers found out that they can also help patients with autism.
Autism;235;The medication can reduce hyperactivity and inattention in people with autism.
Autism;236;The medication can have many side-effects.
Autism;237;Examples are Methylphenidate, Clonidine and Guanfacine.
Autism;238;People with autism often have problems with their digestive organs like the stomach or gut.
Autism;239;These problems could be inflammations, abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea or bacterial overgrowth.
Autism;240;The reasons may be malnutrition, food intolerances or allergies.
Autism;241;Specific food products causing these problems are excluded from the diet.
Autism;242;In many cases, products containing gluten or casein, the main protein occurring in dairy products, are excluded.
Autism;243;In many cases vitamins, minerals as well as essential fatty acids are additionally provided.
Autism;244;A big problem is that many autistic people cannot tell that they have pain.
Autism;245;Therefore, many problems concerning the digestive organs stay undetected.
Autism;246;Therapy can be used to minimize distress caused by sensory overload.
Autism;247;Individual therapy plans are created.
Autism;248;The therapist tries to help the autistic person in many different aspects.
Autism;249;One part of this is sensory integration.
Autism;250;The therapist will help the patient to make sense of different sensory inputs.
Autism;251;For example, they may ask a child patient to play with finger paints or collect objects from a bad of dried beans.
Autism;252;Another part is the training of daily life activities.
Autism;253;The therapist may help the patient to get used to things like getting dressed, eating, hygiene, shopping and financial management.
Autism;254;These may be done one step at a time if the activity involves multiple steps, such as cooking.
Autism;255;Play therapy is also helpful, especially for children.
Autism;256;It can be useful to learn about certain emotions, which can be hard for autistic people.
Autism;257;This can also be used to help learn social conventions, such as shaking hands instead of hugging when meeting a stranger.
Autism;258;Often animals are used to help autistic people.
Autism;259;Most often dogs or horses are used.
Autism;260;The people diagnosed with autism can care for these animals, pet them and, in the case of the horse, even ride on them.
Autism;261;Studies showed that the interaction between an autistic person and animals can increase communication, reduce stress, fear, aggression and reduce the severity of the symptoms of autism.
Autism;262;Music therapy consists of two parts: One is an active listening part.
Autism;263;Here, the therapist is making music himself or playing music from a record.
Autism;264;In the other part, the autistic person can make music himself like playing an instrument or singing.
Autism;265;Music therapy will improve different aspects of communication.
Autism;266;Here, different materials and techniques are used to draw pictures.

Alzheimer's disease;1;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a brain disease that slowly destroys brain cells.
Alzheimer's disease;2;Both tangles and plaques may be caused by other diseases, such as Herpes simplex virus Type 1 which is being investigated as a possible cause or contributor in developing Alzheimer's.
Alzheimer's disease;3;With current research using advances in neuroimaging such as FDG-PET and PIB-PET scans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, it is now possible to detect the beginning processes of Alzheimer's disease that occur before symptoms begin.

Silicosis;1;Silicosis is a disease that is caused by small particles of silica (glass) getting trapped in the lungs.
Silicosis;2;When people have silicosis, the changes in their body often are cyanosis (when skin goes a blueish color), a fever, when the body gets hotter or being not able to breathe properly.
Silicosis;3;Sometimes doctors do not realize that someone has silicosis, and think that they have other illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis or fluid in the lungs.
Silicosis;4;It was first noticed in 1705 by Bernardino Ramazzini (an Italian doctor).
Silicosis;5;He saw something that looked like sand in the lungs of stonecutters.
Silicosis;6;The name silicosis is from Visconti in 1870.
Silicosis;7;The name comes from the Latin silex which means flint.

Color blindness;1;People with color blindness cannot tell the difference between certain colors.
Color blindness;2;They may not see colors at all.
Color blindness;3;Most color blindness is heritable, usually as simple Mendelian inheritance.
Color blindness;4;Sometimes, it is the result of damage to the eyes, nerves, or the brain.
Color blindness;5;It can be caused by coming into contact with certain chemicals.
Color blindness;6;Most color blindness is permanent.
Color blindness;7;Some conditions can lead to temporary color blindness.
Color blindness;8;During certain kinds of migraine, some people are unable to tell the difference between certain colors.
Color blindness;9;There is no treatment cure for permanent color blindness.
Color blindness;10;Many more males are color blind than females.
Color blindness;11;Between five and eight percent of males, but less than one percent of females, are color blind.
Color blindness;12;Color blindness is usually thought of as a disability.
Color blindness;13;However, people who are color blind have one advantage: they are sometimes better at seeing through some types of camouflage.
Color blindness;14;In 1798, English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific article about color blindness.
Color blindness;15;That was after he found out that he was color blind.
Color blindness;16;"The article was called "" Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours "" ."
Color blindness;17;Because of this, the condition is sometimes called daltonism.
Color blindness;18;As of 2009, the word daltonism is used only for the type of color blindness called deuteranopia.
Color blindness;19;There are three steps in the process of telling the difference between colors:   #Light hits specialized nerve cells in the eye.
Color blindness;20;Those cells are called receptors.
Color blindness;21;Some of them are stimulated and create an electrical signal.
Color blindness;22;#The signals move along nerves to special parts of the brain.
Color blindness;23;#Those parts of the brain interpret the signals.
Color blindness;24;The signals are changed into an image.
Color blindness;25;This image is then carefully looked at to separate different objects, to see shapes and sometimes colors, and to link these to other kinds of information.
Color blindness;26;Inside the human eye is a part called the retina.
Color blindness;27;The retina receives the images that the eye sees.
Color blindness;28;It sends the images to the brain.
Color blindness;29;The retina has two types of cells: Rod cells and Cone cells.
Color blindness;30;They work in different types of light.
Color blindness;31;Rod cells receive the images that the eye sees when the light is dim, at night, or in a dark room.
Color blindness;32;Cone cells receive the images that the eye sees in normal daylight or in bright light.
Color blindness;33;There are three types of cone cells.
Color blindness;34;Each type has a different chemical photopsin and reacts to a different spectrum of light.
Color blindness;35;One is specially sensitive to short wavelengths.
Color blindness;36;Another is sensitive to medium wavelengths.
Color blindness;37;The third is sensitive to long wavelengths.
Color blindness;38;These wavelengths cover much of the visible light.
Color blindness;39;"Each color is "" seen "" as a result of how much each of the receptors is stimulated."
Color blindness;40;Parts of the thalamus and the visual cortex in the brain are involved in seeing, also seeing colors.
Color blindness;41;Color blindness can therefore also result if these areas of the brain, the optic nerve or the retina have been damaged.
Color blindness;42;These types of color blindness usually happen because of an accident.
Color blindness;43;They are not inherited.
Color blindness;44;Inherited forms of color blindness affect the retina only.
Color blindness;45;That way it is possible that only a part of the visual field is affected by color blindness, but in the rest, there is no color blindness.
Color blindness;46;Some types of color blindness, but not inherited color blindness, can be cured.
Color blindness;47;There are several different problems that can cause color blindness.
Color blindness;48;If a person's eye has no cone cells, then they cannot see any color at all.
Color blindness;49;They can only see shades of dark and light.
Color blindness;50;There are three types of cone cells in the human eye.
Color blindness;51;If there are two types, a person will have a hard time to tell certain colors apart.
Color blindness;52;If there is only one type, a person will not see color at all.
Color blindness;53;Sometimes cone cells change.
Color blindness;54;This means that they no longer react to those wavelengths they should.
Color blindness;55;A person will need more of a certain color to see this color.
Color blindness;56;They see colors differently, and may not be able to tell certain colors apart.
Color blindness;57;Most of these people do not know they are color blind, as they have little difficulty telling colors apart in most cases.
Color blindness;58;There may be nothing wrong with the eye, but the nerves that transport the information or the area in the brain that interprets it may be damaged.
Color blindness;59;This means that the signal is interpreted the wrong way.
Color blindness;60;The damage may be permanent, or it may be temporary.
Color blindness;61;Certain conditions of the brain, like a migraine can change the way people see colors.
Color blindness;62;This condition is very rare.
Color blindness;63;People who suffer from it can only see in black, gray and white: They can perceive only differences in brightness and do not see color.
Color blindness;64;This is called monochromacy.
Color blindness;65;There are two main types of total color blindness:   Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia): The retina has no cone cells.
Color blindness;66;"This makes it difficult to see even lights of a normal level; this means that people who suffer from it, are almost blind."
Color blindness;67;It occurs almost only on the island of Pingelap, a part of the Pohnpei state in the Federated States of Micronesia.
Color blindness;68;There it is called maskun: about one person in 12 of the population has it.
Color blindness;69;The island was hit by a storm in the 18th century.
Color blindness;70;Very few men survived the storm.
Color blindness;71;One of them carried a gene for rod monochromacy.
Color blindness;72;Today, several hundred people live on the island, about 30% have this gene.
Color blindness;73;Cone monochromacy: The retina has both rods and cones, but only one type kind of cone.
Color blindness;74;People who suffer from this will be able to see patterns well, in normal daylight, but they will not see hues.
Color blindness;75;There are two kinds of red-green color blindness: protanopia or deuteranopia.
Color blindness;76;"Deuteranopia is the most common form of color blindness; between five and ten percent of males suffer from it."
Color blindness;77;It is called Daltonism because John Dalton discovered it.
Color blindness;78;Those affected have trouble telling the difference between red and green.
Color blindness;79;As seen by protanopes (people suffering from protanopia), red is darkened.
Color blindness;80;Most often, this is because they lack the receptors for long (protanopia) or medium (deuteranopia)-length light waves or because these receptors have changed their sensitivity.
Color blindness;81;Although the name is blue-yellow color blindness (tritanopia), people affected by this type of color blindness can usually tell the difference between blue and yellow.
Color blindness;82;Instead they cannot tell the difference between blue and green, and also yellow and violet.
Color blindness;83;It is different from the other types of color blindness because it is not linked to sex.
Color blindness;84;It is equally possible for anyone to develop blue-yellow color blindness.
Color blindness;85;It is caused by having few or no cones in the retina which can sense short wavelength light.
Color blindness;86;"Sometimes, people do not have problems seeing color, but their brain has trouble "" telling "" the color, and interprets it wrong."
Color blindness;87;"It is also possible that only certain parts of the eye have color blindness; people may become color blind because of other diseases, but after the disease goes away, see normally again."
Color blindness;88;This seems to be the case with certain forms of migraine.
Color blindness;89;"Males have one X and one Y chromosome; females have two X chromosomes."
Color blindness;90;Many of the genes involved in making color vision work are on the X chromosome: they are sex linked.
Color blindness;91;For this reason, men are more often affected by color blindness than women.
Color blindness;92;"The "" color blind "" gene allows non-color blind people see the difference between red and green."
Color blindness;93;The gene is located on the X chromosome.
Color blindness;94;"This means that a male will be color blind if the single X he inherits from his mother contains the color blind version of the "" color blind "" gene."
Color blindness;95;A female will inherit color blindness only if she inherits two X chromosomes containing defective (mutant) color gene alleles.
Color blindness;96;"In other words, a female needs to inherit "" color blind "" genes from both parents in order to be color blind."
Color blindness;97;The Ishihara plate test has been in use since 1917.
Color blindness;98;Each plate has an image with dots of different size and color.
Color blindness;99;People will then see different images (most often Arabic numbers).
Color blindness;100;Those with certain types of color blindness will see different numbers from those not affected by color blindness.
Color blindness;101;Because many young children have not learned numbers yet, other tests have been developed.
Color blindness;102;They use symbols, like a square, a circle or a car instead of numbers.
Color blindness;103;A color code is when there is much information in the color of certain item.
Color blindness;104;Such codes cannot be understood easily by those who are color blind.
Color blindness;105;For this reason, color should not be used alone to give information.
Color blindness;106;Good graphic design avoids using color coding or color differences alone to give information.
Color blindness;107;This does not only help color blind people, but also normally sighted people.
Color blindness;108;Cascading Style Sheets can be used on web pages.
Color blindness;109;They allow to give a different color scheme for color blind people.
Color blindness;110;Certain color scheme generators help graphic designers see color schemes as eight types of color blind people see them.
Color blindness;111;Color blindness is very sensitive to changes in material.
Color blindness;112;A red-green color blind person may be unable to see the difference between colors on a map printed on paper.
Color blindness;113;The same map on a computer screen or television may appear normally.
Color blindness;114;In addition, some color blind people find it easier to tell the difference between colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood.
Color blindness;115;Thirdly, for some color blind people, color can only be if there is enough color: thin lines might appear black, but a thicker line of the same color can be seen in the correct color.
Color blindness;116;In certain cases when it is important to understand information very quickly, the visual system may drop the colors, and only work in shades of gray.
Color blindness;117;This is important to know when designing the interfaces for objects that need to be used in an emergency situation, like emergency brakes, or emergency telephones.
Color blindness;118;Because color blind people may not see the difference between colors such as red and green, some countries, such as Romania have refused to give them driving licenses.
Color blindness;119;In Romania, people have started to change the laws so that color blind people will also be able to drive legally.
Color blindness;120;In the United Kingdom, electricity wires in houses used to be red, black and green.
Color blindness;121;"They were changed to brown, blue and green/yellow to help color blind people see the difference between the "" live "" and "" earth "" wires."
Color blindness;122;Many people do not understand color blindness.
Color blindness;123;People who are color blind never swap the colors they are blind to.
Color blindness;124;They may have trouble telling two colors from one another.
Color blindness;125;That way they may have a problem finding the right kind of apple in the supermarket.
Color blindness;126;The image below first shows the way that two apples look to a person with normal vision, and then the way it looks to a person with red-green color blindness.
Color blindness;127;"The left apple is a Braeburn; it is red in color."
Color blindness;128;"The apple on the right is a Granny Smith; it is green."
Color blindness;129;To someone with red-green blindness, the apples look like they are almost the same color.
Infection;1;Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents.
Infection;2;The disease is caused by the invading agents multiplying.
Infection;3;As they multiply, they produce toxins and damage host tissues.
Infection;4;Infectious disease, also known as 'transmissible disease' or 'communicable disease', is illness resulting from an infection.
Infection;5;Tuberculosis - also called TB.
Infection;6;Bubonic plague   Pertussis - also called whooping cough   leprosy   AIDS/HIV   Hepatitis B   Polio   Colds   Influenza - also called the flu.
Infection;7;COVID-19   Thrush   Ringworm   Cryptococcosis   Candidiadis   Athlete's foot   Malaria (carried by mosquitos)   Schistosomiasis (flat worms)   Chagas disease   Prions are proteins which act as infectious diseases.
Infection;8;Some infections are caused by different infectious agents at different times.
Infection;9;For example, some diarrhea is caused by bacteria.
Infection;10;Some is caused by viruses.
Infection;11;Diarrhea   Pneumonia   Meningitis   This is a very short list.
Infection;12;There are many more diseases from infection and other causes: common diseases.
Infection;13;Some diseases can be passed from one person to another easily.
Infection;14;Other infectious diseases are harder to get.
Infection;15;If a person kisses or touches another person who is infected with the flu, a cold, measles, or a sore throat, he or she may get their disease.
Infection;16;They may also give the person their disease if they cough on them.
Infection;17;Other medical conditions such as AIDS, herpes, and hepatitis B, are only passed by closer contact.
Infection;18;Having sex with an infected person, blood transfusions, or touching their blood or urine can sometimes pass on these conditions or diseases.
Infection;19;People can stop disease by:   Covering the mouth every time during coughing   Only drinking clean water   Only eating very cooked meat   Using a condom during sex   Bacteria are usually treated with antibiotic medicines like Tetracycline and Penicillin.
Infection;20;Viruses will not be killed by antibiotics.
Infection;21;They must be treated with special medicines called antivirals.
Infection;22;Medicines to treat HIV/AIDS like zidovudine are antivirals.
Infection;23;Antifungals like miconazole and fluconazole treat infections from fungus.
Infection;24;Anti-parasitic medicines like Praziquantel and mebendazole.
Infection;25;Some infectious diseases have no treatments that work well.
Infection;26;For example, there is no medicine that works well to cure West Nile Virus and Rabies.
Infection;27;So it is important to avoid getting these diseases.
Infection;28;Some infectious disease goes away on its own.
Infection;29;These mild diseases do not need to be treated.
Infection;30;For example, colds are caused by viruses and they do not need medicines.
Infection;31;Some diseases can be prevented by immunizations.
Infection;32;Immunizations try to make a person have an immune reaction to an infectious agent.
Infection;33;This is usually done before the person gets the disease.
Infection;34;Examples of diseases prevented by immunizations are: polio, tetanus, and pertussis.
Infection;35;In some cases, if all of the disease can be removed from society, we can get rid of the disease completely.
Infection;36;An example of this is smallpox.
Infection;37;This virus used to kill people, cause blindness, and bad scars.
Infection;38;Now there has not been a person who had smallpox in over thirty years.

Suicide;1;Suicide is when a person chooses to kill themselves.
Suicide;2;53% of men who committed suicide, and 39% of women, used hanging.
Suicide;3;Worldwide, 30% of people who die by suicide use pesticides.
Suicide;4;This method was most common in the Pacific area, where over half of people who died by suicide used pesticides.
Suicide;5;It was least common in Europe, where only 4% used this method.
Suicide;6;In the United States 52% of suicides involve the use of firearms.
Suicide;7;In the United States, asphyxiation and poisoning are also common.
Suicide;8;About 40% of suicides in the United States used one of these methods.
Suicide;9;Other people in the world die by suicide by:   Blunt force trauma (for example, from jumping off a building)   Cutting themselves and bleeding to death   Drowning themselves   Setting themselves on fire   Electrocuting themselves   Starving themselves   Sometimes, suicidal people do something that will make another person kill them.
Suicide;10;For example, a suicidal person might point a gun at a police officer, so the police officer will shoot the person in self-defense.
Suicide;11;"This is commonly called "" suicide by cop. """
Suicide;12;Modern medicine treats suicide as a mental health issue.
Suicide;13;When a person starts having many thoughts about killing themselves, it is considered a medical emergency.
Suicide;14;The Abrahamic religions (like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) think that life is sacred.
Suicide;15;They believe that when a person kills themselves, they are murdering what God has made.
Suicide;16;For this reason, many followers of Abrahamic religions thinks that when a person dies by suicide, they will go to Hell.
Suicide;17;The Dharmic and Taoist religions (like Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto) believe that someone who does by suicide will be reincarnated in the next life with a less enlightened soul.
Suicide;18;However, many people of these religions are more likely to die by suicide because they believe that there will be a next life.
Suicide;19;They think that by dying by suicide, they may have a better chance in the next life.
Suicide;20;There are several famous examples of suicide attacks in history.
Suicide;21;The Kamikazes were one example.
Suicide;22;They were Japanese fighter pilots during World War II, who would try to kill American soldiers by crashing their planes into American ships.
Suicide;23;By crashing their planes, they would kill themselves as well.
Suicide;24;The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were also done by suicide attackers.
Suicide;25;They flew planes into the World Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon.

Transsexual;1;Transsexual people are people who change their sex.
Transsexual;2;Some transsexual people go from male to female.
Transsexual;3;Others go from female to male.
Transsexual;4;They change how they look and act.
Transsexual;5;They see doctors who can give them drugs and surgery.
Transsexual;6;They change their name and sex through the law.
Transsexual;7;People who go from male to female (MTF) are transsexual women.
Transsexual;8;People who go from female to male (FTM) are transsexual men.
Transsexual;9;Transsexual women take female hormones.
Transsexual;10;They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens.
Transsexual;11;Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow.
Transsexual;12;It does not make beards go away.
Transsexual;13;It does not make voices higher.
Transsexual;14;Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back.
Transsexual;15;This takes a long time and hurts.
Transsexual;16;Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices.
Transsexual;17;Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery.
Transsexual;18;Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals.
Transsexual;19;This is called a vaginoplasty.
Transsexual;20;This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out.
Transsexual;21;Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine.
Transsexual;22;Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger.
Transsexual;23;Transsexual men take male hormones.
Transsexual;24;This will make their voices lower.
Transsexual;25;It will make a beard grow.
Transsexual;26;It can also stop their menstruation.
Transsexual;27;Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.
Transsexual;28;Some transsexual men have surgery.
Transsexual;29;One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy).
Transsexual;30;Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals.
Transsexual;31;One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy).
Transsexual;32;Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals.
Transsexual;33;One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty).
Transsexual;34;Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty).
Transsexual;35;The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis.
Transsexual;36;The phalloplasty looks more like a penis.
Transsexual;37;A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long.
Transsexual;38;Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia.
Transsexual;39;They may also have the vagina taken out or closed.
Transsexual;40;Very rarely, some people (called detransitioners) who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born.

Learning disability;1;Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do.
Learning disability;2;Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn.
Learning disability;3;Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading and writing).
Learning disability;4;They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism).
Learning disability;5;People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence.

Pregnancy;1;Pregnancy is when a female mammal has an unborn baby inside her.
Pregnancy;2;"During pregnancy, a female is called "" pregnant "" ."
Pregnancy;3;A human pregnancy is about 38 weeks long, from conception to childbirth.
Pregnancy;4;Usually the mother has one baby at a time.
Pregnancy;5;Sometimes the mother has two babies at one time.
Pregnancy;6;Two babies are called twins.
Pregnancy;7;The mother can have three or more babies at one time.
Pregnancy;8;This does not happen very often.
Pregnancy;9;Pregnancy usually starts after a woman has sexual intercourse with a man.
Pregnancy;10;Her ovum (or egg) and his sperm (seed) come together and form a zygote (fertilized egg) inside her.
Pregnancy;11;Some people have trouble becoming pregnant.
Pregnancy;12;This is called infertility.
Pregnancy;13;Women and men with infertility may take drugs or have surgery to help a pregnancy start.
Pregnancy;14;Some people use treatments that are not natural, like in vitro fertilization, to become pregnant with the help of a doctor.
Pregnancy;15;When the woman's egg and the man's seed come together, it makes one cell called a zygote.
Pregnancy;16;The zygote grows into an embryo, which grows into a fetus.
Pregnancy;17;When the fetus is ready, the baby is born.
Pregnancy;18;Human pregnancy is divided into three parts called trimesters.
Pregnancy;19;A trimester is about three months long.
Pregnancy;20;During the first trimester, the woman might feel ill in her stomach.
Pregnancy;21;She might have to urinate often.
Pregnancy;22;During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen starts to stick out.
Pregnancy;23;During the third trimester, her abdomen sticks out even more, and she becomes even heavier.
Pregnancy;24;At the end of a full pregnancy, the woman's body pushes the baby out through her vagina.
Pregnancy;25;This is called delivering a baby or giving birth.
Pregnancy;26;Mothers can get help for birth from a midwife, nurse, or doctor.
Pregnancy;27;In some places, mothers give birth at home.
Pregnancy;28;In other places, mothers give birth in a hospital.
Pregnancy;29;Mothers who are ill or hurt may need to go to a hospital.
Pregnancy;30;Giving birth can hurt a lot at the end.
Pregnancy;31;In hospitals, a doctor or midwife can give drugs to the mother to reduce the pain.
Pregnancy;32;If the baby cannot be pushed out, then a doctor can cut the mother open to take the baby out.
Pregnancy;33;This operation is called a Caesarean section.
Pregnancy;34;The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women says that pregnant women must be given time away from work or equal welfare for her baby without losing her job (Article 11).
Pregnancy;35;Sometimes there are problems with pregnancies.
Pregnancy;36;A miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) is when the baby dies before it is born.
Pregnancy;37;A stillbirth is when the baby is dead when it is born.
Pregnancy;38;There are also diseases caused by pregnancy.
Pregnancy;39;Sometimes, women die from giving birth.
Pregnancy;40;In developed countries, this is much less common than it used to be.
Pregnancy;41;Every year, about 500,000 women die from giving birth, while about 7,000,000 mothers have big problems from giving birth.
Pregnancy;42;For example, giving birth can tear the mother's body and cause an obstetric fistula.
Pregnancy;43;A pregnancy can also stop without the baby being born.
Pregnancy;44;This is called abortion.
Pregnancy;45;Doctors can do things that will stop a pregnancy.
Pregnancy;46;Such an abortion is called induced abortion.
Pregnancy;47;Countries have different laws about induced abortions.
Pregnancy;48;Some countries allow it, and others do not.
Pregnancy;49;In some countries, it is allowed, but only for certain reasons, such as the pregnancy resulting from rape, or a doctor saying that the pregnant woman might die if the pregnancy is not stopped.
Pregnancy;50;People also have different opinions about abortion.
Pregnancy;51;Often, these are influenced by religious beliefs.
Pregnancy;52;There are a few diseases that can kill a woman or make her very ill if she has a baby.
Pregnancy;53;Having abortions could save the lives or health of these mothers.
Pregnancy;54;A pregnancy test is something that women use to tell whether they are pregnant.
Pregnancy;55;The woman urinates on the stick.
Pregnancy;56;If the woman is pregnant, a plus sign or two lines will appear on the stick.
Pregnancy;57;If the woman is not pregnant, then a minus sign or one line will appear on the stick.
Hypercholesterolemia;1;Hypercholesterolemia means that the cholesterol level is too high in the blood.
Hypercholesterolemia;2;Cholesterol is a molecule in cells.
Hypercholesterolemia;3;It is a type of lipid which is a fat or fat-like molecule.
Hypercholesterolemia;4;Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a steroid.
Hypercholesterolemia;5;Steroids are lipids that have a special chemical structure.
Hypercholesterolemia;6;This structure is made of four rings of carbon atoms.
Hypercholesterolemia;7;Other steroids include hormone steroids like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone.
Hypercholesterolemia;8;In fact, all steroid hormones are made from changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;9;When scientists talk about making one molecule from changing simpler ones, they sometimes call it synthesis.
Hypercholesterolemia;10;Cholesterol is usually in the walls of cells.
Hypercholesterolemia;11;It is only in animals.
Hypercholesterolemia;12;Plants do not synthesize cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;13;So the cholesterol in the food people eat can only come from eating food from animals.
Hypercholesterolemia;14;But even vegans who eat only plant foods can have cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;15;This is because most of the cholesterol that is in our bodies is synthesized by our bodies.
Hypercholesterolemia;16;Cholesterol does many important jobs in a cell.
Hypercholesterolemia;17;Cholesterols main function is as a structural component of cell membranes.
Hypercholesterolemia;18;It is also the starting material for bile acids that are made by the liver and used to digest fats, and for steroid hormones.
Hypercholesterolemia;19;However, it is best known for something bad that it does.
Hypercholesterolemia;20;High levels of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis.
Hypercholesterolemia;21;This is an inflammatory disease of artery walls in which white blood cells invade the vessel wall and become engorged with cholesterol and other lipids.
Hypercholesterolemia;22;These   areas can slowly close off a blood vessel or can suddenly rupture and trigger formation of a blood clot.
Hypercholesterolemia;23;Not all cholesterol is bad.
Hypercholesterolemia;24;There are different kinds of cholesterol in the blood.
Hypercholesterolemia;25;Doctors often measure these different types to see if someone has hypercholesterolemia.
Hypercholesterolemia;26;HDL, an acronym for 'high density lipoprotein' is sometimes called 'good cholesterol' because people with high levels of HDL cholesterol have less atherosclerosis.
Hypercholesterolemia;27;LDL (low density lipoprotein) is sometimes called 'bad cholesterol' because people with high levels of LDL cholesterol have more atherosclerosis.
Hypercholesterolemia;28;High blood levels of VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) also causes more atherosclerosis.
Hypercholesterolemia;29;However, measuring its level in blood is more expensive.
Hypercholesterolemia;30;So the blood level of triglycerides (a kind of fat) is used instead.
Hypercholesterolemia;31;High triglycerides (TG) are found in people with high VLDL.
Hypercholesterolemia;32;When atherosclerosis gets bad enough, it can cause blockage of blood flow in arteries.
Hypercholesterolemia;33;This can hurt whatever the artery brings blood to.
Hypercholesterolemia;34;The organ or tissue that the blocked artery brought blood to can even die.
Hypercholesterolemia;35;If the organ or tissue dies, doctors call this an infarction.
Hypercholesterolemia;36;If it is hurt from low blood flow, but not enough to die, it is called ischemia.
Hypercholesterolemia;37;If the artery brought blood to the heart, people can have angina or a heart attack.
Hypercholesterolemia;38;A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction.
Hypercholesterolemia;39;Myocardial means relating to the heart muscle.
Hypercholesterolemia;40;Infarction means death of a tissue or organ.
Hypercholesterolemia;41;So a myocardial infarction or heart attack is when blood flow to part of the heart stops.
Hypercholesterolemia;42;Then that part of the heart dies.
Hypercholesterolemia;43;Angina is when the blood flow is low but not totally blocked.
Hypercholesterolemia;44;If the blocked artery brought blood to the brain, people can have a stroke.
Hypercholesterolemia;45;If the blocked artery is to the kidneys, it can cause kidney failure.
Hypercholesterolemia;46;If the blocked artery is to an arm or leg, they may also die.
Hypercholesterolemia;47;If this happens, the arm or leg may need to be amputated (cut off) if the blood vessel cannot be fixed by doctors.
Hypercholesterolemia;48;The best way to treat it is to not get it!
Hypercholesterolemia;49;Some people develop atherosclerosis faster than others.
Hypercholesterolemia;50;Some develop it very slowly.
Hypercholesterolemia;51;Many things make those differences between people.
Hypercholesterolemia;52;Some are things people can change.
Hypercholesterolemia;53;Some are not.
Hypercholesterolemia;54;Unchangeable things   Genetics (whether people have good genes or bad ones from their parents.)
Hypercholesterolemia;55;Sex (men get atherosclerosis earlier than women)   Changeable things   Smoking   Control of diabetes and high blood pressure   Exercise   Diet – the foods a person eats.
Hypercholesterolemia;56;(low cholesterol, low fat, and more fruits and vegetables is better)   However, once someone gets hypercholesterolemia which means high blood cholesterol, doctors treat them.
Hypercholesterolemia;57;The first way to treat hypercholesterolemia is to exercise, quit smoking, and eat better foods.
Hypercholesterolemia;58;If these work and the cholesterol blood levels become normal, no more treatment is needed.
Hypercholesterolemia;59;If these do not work, sometimes medicines are also needed.
Hypercholesterolemia;60;But even if medicine is used, it is still important to stop smoking, eat better, and exercise.
Hypercholesterolemia;61;Once someone gets atherosclerosis from hypercholesterolemia, a better diet, exercise, and quitting smoking may not be enough.
Hypercholesterolemia;62;If people already have atherosclerosis that causes problems like heart attack or strokes, medicine is almost always needed.
Hypercholesterolemia;63;People with atherosclerosis must also be watched by doctors to make sure they do not get ischemia or infarction.
Hypercholesterolemia;64;Since they are more likely to get a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke, they must watch for signs of these.
Hypercholesterolemia;65;Sometimes if a doctor thinks a person has atherosclerosis she may do tests to find atherosclerosis before it causes symptoms of ischemia or infarction.
Hypercholesterolemia;66;But if people get symptoms of these problems, it is important to see a doctor immediately.
Hypercholesterolemia;67;For all of these types of ischemia or infarction, doctors can try to reopen the blocked artery.
Hypercholesterolemia;68;This may be done by surgery or sometimes with very strong medicines to make the blood less able to make clots.
Hypercholesterolemia;69;If this is not done fast enough, the tissue or organ with ischemia may be too badly hurt, and it might not be able to be saved.
Hypercholesterolemia;70;The most common type of medicine to treat hypercholesterolemia are 'statin' drugs.
Hypercholesterolemia;71;They are called 'statins' because their names all end in -statin.
Hypercholesterolemia;72;They are also called HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors.
Hypercholesterolemia;73;This is because they work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA Reductase.
Hypercholesterolemia;74;Inhibiting an enzyme means to make it work less well.
Hypercholesterolemia;75;The HMG-CoA Reductase enzyme causes the body to make more cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;76;If it is inhibited, the body makes less cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;77;So statin drugs lower the amount of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood which stops atherosclerosis from getting worse.
Hypercholesterolemia;78;Statin drugs can even help make atherosclerosis better.
Hypercholesterolemia;79;However, statins are not as good at increasing the HDL (good) cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia;80;Low HDL is hard to treat with medicines, but goes up with more exercise!
Hypercholesterolemia;81;There are two big problems with taking statins: Liver problems and 'Rhabdomyolysis.'
Hypercholesterolemia;82;Rhabdomyolysis means a disease where muscle cells are damaged and die.
Hypercholesterolemia;83;Statins can cause damage to muscle cells.
Hypercholesterolemia;84;This can cause weakness and muscle pain.
Hypercholesterolemia;85;The worse problem though is that when muscle cells die, they release cell proteins into the blood.
Hypercholesterolemia;86;The kidney removes the muscle protein from the blood.
Hypercholesterolemia;87;If the kidney takes up too much protein, it can be hurt.
Hypercholesterolemia;88;If it is bad enough it can cause kidney failure.
Hypercholesterolemia;89;So if people take statins and get muscle pain or weakness, stop the medicine and see a doctor.
Hypercholesterolemia;90;Statins can also cause liver problems.
Hypercholesterolemia;91;They can cause mild irritation of the liver.
Hypercholesterolemia;92;They can rarely cause very bad liver damage.
Hypercholesterolemia;93;Because of this, when someone starts taking a statin, doctors check liver blood tests after six weeks.
Hypercholesterolemia;94;Doctors also warn patients to watch for the signs of liver damage: pain in the right side of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice.
Hypercholesterolemia;95;However, both of these problems are rare.
Hypercholesterolemia;96;In someone with hypercholesterolemia, the benefit from statins is more than the risk.
Hypercholesterolemia;97;This means that someone is more likely to prevent problems than cause problems by taking them.
Hypercholesterolemia;98;There are many big scientific studies of this problem that show the same thing: if people have hypercholesterolemia and take statins, they are more likely to live longer and be healthier.
Hypercholesterolemia;99;There are other kinds of medicines to treat hypercholesterolemia.
Hypercholesterolemia;100;But statins are the most effective treatment.
Hypercholesterolemia;101;Fibrates are medicines that lower cholesterol levels.
Hypercholesterolemia;102;They may also help people with Type II Diabetes.
Hypercholesterolemia;103;This is a good effect because diabetes and hypercholesterolemia cause some of the same problems.
Hypercholesterolemia;104;If both diabetes and hypercholesterolemia happen in the same person the problems from these diseases can be much worse.
Hypercholesterolemia;105;Fibrates can have rhabdomyolysis like the statins and also can cause upset stomach.
Hypercholesterolemia;106;Use of fibrates and statins at the same time makes rhabdomyolysis happen much more often.
Hypercholesterolemia;107;Niacin is a vitamin that lowers cholesterol levels.
Hypercholesterolemia;108;It is also called Vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid.
Hypercholesterolemia;109;Severe niacin deficiency in the diet can cause a disease called Pellagra.
Hypercholesterolemia;110;This is rare in the developed world today.
Hypercholesterolemia;111;However, less bad deficiency of niacin can cause high blood pressure, weight gain, and hypercholesterolemia.
Hypercholesterolemia;112;So sometimes Niacin is used to treat hypercholesterolemia.
Hypercholesterolemia;113;Niacin is one of the medicines that may make HDL (good) cholesterol go up.
Hypercholesterolemia;114;The biggest problem with taking enough Niacin to help cholesterol is that it causes severe flushing (hot, red, sometimes itchy skin).
Hypercholesterolemia;115;This 'side-effect' is so bad, sometimes people stop taking the medicine.
Hypercholesterolemia;116;Bile Acid Resins are medicines that make people not absorb as much bile when they digest food.
Hypercholesterolemia;117;This causes them to take up less cholesterol also, which lowers blood levels of cholesterol.
Cholera;1;Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
Cholera;2;Between 1900 and 1920, in India, up to eight million people died of cholera.
Cholera;3;in 1854, an English doctor named John Snow was the first person to realize that contaminated water caused cholera.
Cholera;4;Today, countries in Europe and North America filter and add chlorine to their water supplies.
Cholera;5;This has made cholera very uncommon in these countries.
Cholera;6;Information about cholera in Simple English from the CDC   CDC facts about cholera   WHO facts about cholera   Rehydration Project talks about ORSs (oral rehydration solutions)
Vomiting;1;REDIRECT Vomit
Malaria;1;Malaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in most parts of India and other tropical countries.
Malaria;2;It is most comman health problems.
Malaria;3;As per latest WHO estimates (2011)between 149–274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa.
Malaria;4;This amounts to one malaria death every minute.
Malaria;5;In India the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s).
Malaria;6;Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite: it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito.
Malaria;7;People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood.
Malaria;8;The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year.
Malaria;9;(from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s).
Malaria;10;However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid 1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% indian population lives in malaria risk areas.
Malaria;11;The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'Plasmodium'.
Malaria;12;Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria.
Malaria;13;Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans.
Malaria;14;People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes: they are the vectors of the disease.
Malaria;15;The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes.
Malaria;16;The Plasmodium is in the mosquito's special saliva.
Malaria;17;The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting.
Malaria;18;The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by-product.
Malaria;19;This makes the person have the disease we call malaria.
Malaria;20;Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood.
Malaria;21;The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers.
Malaria;22;The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs.
Malaria;23;Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes.
Malaria;24;A baby can get it while inside its mother.
Malaria;25;This is called maternal-foetal transmission.
Malaria;26;People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion.
Malaria;27;This is when someone gives blood to another person.
Malaria;28;Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them.
Malaria;29;There are several species (kinds) of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans:   serious disease:   Plasmodium falciparum   milder disease:   Plasmodium malariae   Plasmodium ovale   Plasmodium vivax   species which normally infect other primates:   Plasmodium knowesli   P. vivax and P. falciparum cause the most malaria in people.
Malaria;30;Falciparum malaria is the worst kind, and kills the most people.
Malaria;31;When Plasmodium enters the blood, they are then called sporozoites.
Malaria;32;Sporozoites go to the liver, where they make many more sporozoites.
Malaria;33;Then they change into a different form of Plasmodium.
Malaria;34;This form is the merozoite.
Malaria;35;The merozoites go into the red blood cells, then they make many more merozoites.
Malaria;36;The merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again.
Malaria;37;When they do this, the person gets very sick, and shows symptoms of malaria.
Malaria;38;This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm.
Malaria;39;P. vivax and P. ovale can live in the liver for a long time.
Malaria;40;A person can look well, but still have the Plasmodium in the liver.
Malaria;41;This is called a dormant phase.
Malaria;42;Weeks or months later, the Plasmodium can leave the liver to the blood, and the person will get sick again.
Malaria;43;P. falciparum is the most dangerous type of malaria.
Malaria;44;It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria, because there are more of them in the blood.
Malaria;45;Also, with falciparum malaria, the red blood cells are sticky.
Malaria;46;This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels.
Malaria;47;If blood vessels are blocked, this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to, and can hurt people's organs.
Malaria;48;Pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria.
Malaria;49;When they get malaria, they get sicker.
Malaria;50;40% of people live in a place where there is malaria.
Malaria;51;Malaria is in these places:   Africa   Asia (mostly in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia)   Central and South America   Hispaniola   Eastern Europe   South Pacific (the part of the Pacific Ocean south of the equator)   Every year, 300 to 700 million people get malaria.
Malaria;52;It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year.
Malaria;53;90% of the deaths occur in Africa.
Malaria;54;Most of the people who die from malaria are children.
Malaria;55;Even if children do not die, many have brain damage.
Malaria;56;Many of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control.
Malaria;57;But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries.
Malaria;58;These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes, or to give people medicine.
Malaria;59;Money, however, is not the only problem.
Malaria;60;A country must have an organised medical system to provide services.
Malaria;61;Many countries in central Africa have been disrupted by warfare and conflict between groups, and general unrest.
Malaria;62;Also, easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did 50 years ago.
Malaria;63;This is because the insects are resistant to many insecticides, and the Plasmodium parasite is highly resistant to quinine and most other common drugs.
Malaria;64;This is a normal evolutionary process: the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms, and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply.
Malaria;65;Symptoms are changes in someone's body that are signs for a disease.
Malaria;66;Most people who get malaria get symptoms 10–30 days after they get infected (the Plasmodium gets in their blood.)
Malaria;67;But some people can get symptoms after only a week, and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year.
Malaria;68;The most common symptom of malaria is fever, when the body temperature is high.
Malaria;69;The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly.
Malaria;70;The people who have malaria often feel like they had influenza.
Malaria;71;Symptoms of malaria are:   Arthralgia (pain in joints)   Headache (pain in head)   Feeling very tired or sleepy   Cough   Chills (feeling very cold)   Delirium (when people are very confused because of a disease.
Malaria;72;They may look drunk.
Malaria;73;They may not be able to talk.)
Malaria;74;Coma (when people are not conscious.
Malaria;75;They look like they are asleep, but they cannot be woken. )
Malaria;76;Signs of malaria:   Anemia (low red blood cell levels in the blood)   Diarrhea   Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)   Sweating   Vomiting   Fast heart rate   Low blood pressure   Enlarged organs.
Malaria;77;When something becomes enlarged or BIGGER than normal the word often ends in -megaly.
Malaria;78;Hepatomegaly -enlarged liver, splenomegaly - enlarged spleen, or both hepatosplenomegaly.
Malaria;79;When these organs become enlarged it may cause pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
Malaria;80;Complications are problems that happen because of a disease.
Malaria;81;Pregnant women and young children have more complications.
Malaria;82;People who get malaria for the first time have more complications.
Malaria;83;Falciparum malaria has the most complications.
Malaria;84;Complications of malaria are:   Cerebral malaria (brain malaria)   To have cerebral malaria, the following must be present:   P. falciparum in the blood.
Malaria;85;Coma, many seizures, or long delirium   If no treatment is given, death often occurs.
Malaria;86;Even if treatment is given, 15%-20% of people with it die.
Malaria;87;Seizures (if only one seizure happens it is not cerebral malaria)   Damage to the brain   Blackwater fever   Many red blood cells break open and the hemoglobin in the cells gets into the blood.
Malaria;88;This hemoglobin is put in the urine and makes it look very dark.
Malaria;89;Without the right care this can make the kidneys stop working.
Malaria;90;Pulmonary oedema   This is fluid in the lungs that makes it hard to breathe.
Malaria;91;Pregnant women get this much more.
Malaria;92;80% of people who get this complication die.
Malaria;93;Very low blood sugar   Children and pregnant women get this more.
Malaria;94;This can cause people to look like they are drunk or to be in a coma.
Malaria;95;Hemolysis   This means breakdown of red blood cells.
Malaria;96;It can cause blackwater fever, jaundice, and symptoms of anemia.
Malaria;97;Coagulopathy (not being able to stop bleeding)    Malaria microscopy                     A technician looks for the malaria parasite in blood films (blood smears).
Malaria;98;Microscopic view of malaria parasites in a blood smear.
Malaria;99;Arrows point to infected red blood cells.
Malaria;100;A clinical diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms of a disease, it is a diagnosis made without medical testing.
Malaria;101;In the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever.
Malaria;102;Any clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible.
Malaria;103;A Malaria rapid diagnostic test is a blood test which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes.
Malaria;104;RDTs are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks, and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary.
Malaria;105;To see if patients have malaria, doctors may do a blood test.
Malaria;106;This test is called a Giemsa blood smear.
Malaria;107;Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass.
Malaria;108;The Giemsa stain is put on the slide.
Malaria;109;This stain helps doctors see the malaria.
Malaria;110;Then they look at the slide under a microscope.
Malaria;111;The Plasmodium is seen in the red blood cells.
Malaria;112;People with different kinds of malaria need different medicines.
Malaria;113;The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind.
Malaria;114;So it is very important to know which species of Plasmodium the person has.
Malaria;115;If the species is not known, the person should be given medicine and care like they have falciparum malaria the worst kind.
Malaria;116;It is also important to know where the person got malaria.
Malaria;117;Plasmodium in some places is resistant to some medicines.
Malaria;118;So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America.
Malaria;119;Everywhere except New Guinea, the treatment is the same.
Malaria;120;In New Guinea most P. vivax is resistant to chloroquine.
Malaria;121;It can be treated with quinine, but this medicine can make people sick.
Malaria;122;Everywhere else, non-falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine.
Malaria;123;Chloroquine kills the Plasmodium in the blood.
Malaria;124;But the Plasmodium in the liver is not killed by chloroquine.
Malaria;125;P. vivax and P. ovale both stay in the liver a long time.
Malaria;126;This is the dormant phase.
Malaria;127;Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for P. vivax and P. ovale.
Malaria;128;This is to kill the Plasmodium in the liver.
Malaria;129;The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is primaquine.
Malaria;130;In southeast Asia, some P. vivax is resistant to primaquine.
Malaria;131;Most other places, primaquine works very well.
Malaria;132;Some people get very sick from primaquine.
Malaria;133;So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD-deficiency before they take primaquine.
Malaria;134;Falciparum is the worst kind of malaria.
Malaria;135;People with falciparum malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are:   Very sick   Children   Pregnant   Having malaria for the first time   Not able to take medicines by mouth   Even people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8 hours.
Malaria;136;This is to make sure they do not get sicker.
Malaria;137;It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth.
Malaria;138;Malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated.
Malaria;139;Falciparum malaria also has more resistance to medicines.
Malaria;140;This makes it much harder to treat.
Malaria;141;Falciparum malaria is always treated with two or more medicines.
Malaria;142;Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria.
Malaria;143;Different places have P. falciparum that is resistant to different medicines.
Malaria;144;The most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance.
Malaria;145;In some places in the world, P. falciparum is killed by chloroquine.
Malaria;146;In some places it is chloroquine-resistant.
Malaria;147;This means chloroquine does not kill it.
Malaria;148;In these places quinine can be used.
Malaria;149;Quinine is taken by mouth.
Malaria;150;There are three ways to prevent malaria:   Control mosquitoes   Keep mosquitoes from biting   Take medicine to keep from getting sick after a bite, especially in those parts of the world where people get malaria.
Malaria;151;Vector control is one way to stop malaria.
Malaria;152;Vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism.
Malaria;153;For malaria, the vector is the Anopheles mosquito.
Malaria;154;The most used method of vector control is pesticides.
Malaria;155;These are chemicals that kill the mosquito.
Malaria;156;The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT.
Malaria;157;DDT worked very well for vector control.
Malaria;158;It killed mosquitoes.
Malaria;159;It did not make people very sick at the time it was used.
Malaria;160;It did not cost very much money.
Malaria;161;Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet.
Malaria;162;In many places mosquitoes became resistant to DDT.
Malaria;163;This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas.
Malaria;164;Scientists worried that DDT was making people and animals sick.
Malaria;165;It killed a lot of wildlife too.
Malaria;166;DDT also stays in the environment for a long time.
Malaria;167;For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control.
Malaria;168;Organophosphate or carbonate pesticides are used, like malathion or bendiocarb.
Malaria;169;Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria.
Malaria;170;And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control.
Malaria;171;The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods.
Malaria;172;In some places, DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria.
Malaria;173;This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria.
Malaria;174;The mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn (when the sun comes up) and dusk (when the sun goes down.)
Malaria;175;Be most careful at these times.
Malaria;176;Wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves.
Malaria;177;Wear mosquito repellent (this is a chemical that mosquitoes do not like, so they do not bite.)
Malaria;178;Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth.
Malaria;179;So repellent should be used on skin and clothes.
Malaria;180;Pesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes.
Malaria;181;When sleeping outside, people use a mosquito net.
Malaria;182;This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out.
Malaria;183;It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out.
Malaria;184;Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping.
Malaria;185;It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin, which repels and kills mosquitoes.
Malaria;186;People can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria.
Malaria;187;This reduces the chances that they contract malaria.
Malaria;188;This is called prophylaxis.
Malaria;189;Some people take prophylactic medicines for years.
Malaria;190;Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine.
Malaria;191;People who live where there is no malaria usually have not had malaria.
Malaria;192;The first case malaria is usually much worse.
Malaria;193;So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria.
Malaria;194;The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are.
Malaria;195;This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place.
Malaria;196;To make them work best, prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way.
Malaria;197;The medicine should start before going to an area with malaria.
Malaria;198;Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home.
Malaria;199;One medicine (Malarone) only needs to be used for one week after coming home.
Malaria;200;There are some children in Tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria.
Malaria;201;Researchers are using this to develop a new vaccine.
Malaria;202;U.S. researchers have found the children produce an antibody which attacks the malaria-causing parasite.
Malaria;203;Injecting a form of this antibody into mice protected the animals from the disease.
Malaria;204;The researchers plan to do tests on primates, including humans.
Malaria;205;It was Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, working in the Presidency General Hospital in the Kolkata, who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.
Malaria;206;He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds.
Malaria;207;He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.
Malaria;208;For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
Malaria;209;After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius.
Malaria;210;The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900.
Malaria;211;Its recommendations were used during construction of the Panama Canal.
Malaria;212;This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.
Malaria;213;The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine.
Malaria;214;This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru.
Malaria;215;The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria.
Malaria;216;The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted.
Malaria;217;It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by French chemists.
Malaria;218;In the early 20th century, before antibiotics became available, Julius Wagner-Jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria.
Malaria;219;The resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes, and quinine could be administered to control the malaria.
Malaria;220;Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.
Malaria;221;Malaria was the largest hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected.
Malaria;222;Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the North African and South Pacific campaigns.

Testicle;1;Testicles are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures.
Testicle;2;Male mammals, including humans, have two testicles, supported in a sac of skin below the penis called the scrotum.
Testicle;3;"Along with the penis, testicles are called reproductory organs or "" sex organs "" ."
Testicle;4;"Only males have testicles; females have ovaries."
Testicle;5;Testicles are a type of organ called glands.
Testicle;6;Like other glands, testicles make chemical substances, called hormones that keep the body working.
Testicle;7;Testicles also make sperm, which can join with ova to make new life.
Testicle;8;Most glands, like women's ovaries, are inside the body, but testicles are outside the main part of the body.
Testicle;9;This is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body.
Testicle;10;In cold weather, testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm.
Testicle;11;The testicles are firm, oval-shaped glands.
Testicle;12;Most testicles match in size, but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others.
Testicle;13;Normal sized testicles are between 14 cm³ to 35 cm³.
Testicle;14;Most men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one.
Testicle;15;Scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other.
Testicle;16;It is usually, but not always, the left testicle that hangs lower.
Testicle;17;The testicles hang in the scrotum by the spermatic cord.
Testicle;18;They are outside the body because they need to be cooler than the temperature inside the body, in order to make sperm.
Testicle;19;If a man's testicles get cold, they are automatically pulled closer to the body.
Testicle;20;The spermatic cord is tightened by the cremasteric muscle.
Testicle;21;When this muscle contracts (pulls tighter), the cord gets shorter, which pulls the testicles closer to the body.
Testicle;22;If the testicles are too warm, the cremasteric muscle relaxes (gets longer.)
Testicle;23;This lowers the testicles to keep them cooler.
Testicle;24;This is how the testicles are kept at the right temperature.
Testicle;25;This is called the cremasteric reflex.
Testicle;26;(A reflex is something your body automatically does without you thinking about it.)
Testicle;27;There are other uses for the cremasteric reflex apart from making the testicles the right temperature.
Testicle;28;Stress can also make the cremasteric reflex work.
Testicle;29;If a male human or mammal gets into a fight, then its testicles are in danger.
Testicle;30;They automatically pull up close to the body.
Testicle;31;The cremasteric reflex also happens during sexual intercourse.
Testicle;32;Testicles have two important jobs in the body.
Testicle;33;They are part of two of the body's systems, the endocrine system which keeps the body working, and the reproductive system which makes new life.
Testicle;34;Testicles are a type of organ called glands.
Testicle;35;(This makes them part of the body's endocrine system.)
Testicle;36;The human body has many types of glands.
Testicle;37;The job of glands within a body is to make chemical substances, and put them out into the body's system.
Testicle;38;A body has lots of different systems that keep it in good working order all the time, and that also provide for a body's special needs.
Testicle;39;Some of the body's special needs happen when a person gets angry, frightened or sick, or if the person wants to have sexual intercourse.
Testicle;40;At these times a body uses more of some types of chemical substance, so the glands that make them work harder.
Testicle;41;Testicles make several types of chemical substances.
Testicle;42;They are not simple chemicals, but are very complicated and very important to life.
Testicle;43;Making these substances is controlled by the pituitary gland which is a small gland in the brain.
Testicle;44;One substance made by the testicles is a type of substance known as a hormone.
Testicle;45;It is the hormone testosterone.
Testicle;46;Testosterone is important in a male person's body, because it makes him grow into a man and feel like a man during puberty.
Testicle;47;(Women's bodies make some testosterone too, but they make more female hormone called estrogen.)
Testicle;48;As well as being chemical-producing glands, testicles are gonads.
Testicle;49;(This makes them part of the body's reproductive system.)
Testicle;50;Apart from hormones, the other important substances made by the testicles are spermatozoa, which are generally just called sperm.
Testicle;51;"(The word "" sperm "" is plural, so you do not add an "" s "" and say "" sperms "" .)"
Testicle;52;"The sperm are tiny living cells which can join with another cell, called an "" ovum "" (or egg) inside a female, to start a new human life."
Testicle;53;Scientists call making sperm spermatogenesis.
Testicle;54;Boys begin making sperm when they start growing into men, at a time of life called puberty.
Testicle;55;Females do not have testicles.
Testicle;56;The glands in their bodies that do the same sort of jobs as testicles are called ovaries.
Testicle;57;They have two ovaries, but unlike testicles, ovaries are inside the body, on either side of the uterus.
Testicle;58;They release ova (or eggs) and female hormones.
Testicle;59;"Ovaries and testicles are sometimes called "" gonads "" ."
Testicle;60;:(See the picture, right)   The testicles, inside the scrotum, are covered with a tough type of white protective skin called a membrane.
Testicle;61;The inner part of the testicles have many small tubes called seminiferous tubules which are coiled (or twisted around).
Testicle;62;Sperm are made inside the seminiferous tubules.
Testicle;63;The sperm pass through some small tubes called ducts into another part at the back of the testicle, called the epididymis, which is where the sperm cells finish maturing.
Testicle;64;The sperm cells then travel along a tube called the vas deferens until they reach the urethra.
Testicle;65;The urethra is the main tube in the penis and leads to the opening at the end called the urethral opening.
Testicle;66;The urethral opening is also the way that urine leaves the body from the bladder.
Testicle;67;When a man feels sexual desire, sperm cells go through the ejaculatory duct.
Testicle;68;They are combined with liquid called seminal fluid from a gland called the prostate.
Testicle;69;The prostate also has muscles that push the sperm and fluid into the urethra.
Testicle;70;During sexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing the sperm comes out through the urethral opening when a man ejaculates.
Testicle;71;If the sperm from the testicles enters the vagina of a woman during sexual intercourse, it may pass into the uterus and join with a mature ovum (or egg) to begin a new baby.
Testicle;72;Size in animals   Studying animals can help in understanding things about people.
Testicle;73;In mammals, testicles can be very big or very small in relation to the size of the animal itself.
Testicle;74;The size has to do with the amount of sperm that the male animal needs to make.
Testicle;75;Some types of male animal generally only have one sexual partner at a time and are called monogamous.
Testicle;76;Some types of animals generally live in a herd or flock where one male will have many female sexual partners.
Testicle;77;These males are called polygamous.
Testicle;78;More sperm is needed by polygamous males than by monogamous males.
Testicle;79;Polygamous males generally have larger testicles than monogamous males.
Testicle;80;The testicles grow larger to make more sperm.
Testicle;81;Size in men   Most men's testicles are from 14 cm³ to 35 cm³.
Testicle;82;This is a measure of volume.
Testicle;83;Sometimes Doctors need to measure a man's testicles to see if there is a problem.
Testicle;84;Doctors can measure the volume of testicles in two ways:   Orchidometer – This is a set of small objects that look like eggs.
Testicle;85;They are many different sizes.
Testicle;86;The doctor picks the one that is the size of the testicle.
Testicle;87;Doctors know what size the orchidometer is.
Testicle;88;Then they know the size of the testicle.
Testicle;89;Measuring the size – with a ruler, calipers, or ultrasound.
Testicle;90;Then these lengths are used to calculate the volume.
Testicle;91;Sometimes the size of a man's testicles changes.
Testicle;92;Some reasons why testicles get smaller are:   If a man takes testosterone, the testicles do not have to work to make testosterone, so they become smaller.
Testicle;93;If a man's testicles are kept more warm than usual, they make less sperm.
Testicle;94;So if they are kept too warm, they get smaller.
Testicle;95;If testicles are injured(hurt) they can become smaller.
Testicle;96;Some reasons why testicles get bigger are:   If a man takes hormones from the pituitary gland, (called gonadotropins), it can make testicles bigger.
Testicle;97;Gonadtropins are the hormones that tell the testicles to make sperm and testosterone.
Testicle;98;Some diseases cause testicles to swell.
Testicle;99;The most important diseases of testicles are:   Inflammation of the testicles.
Testicle;100;This is called orchitis   Testicular cancer   Fluid around a testicle.
Testicle;101;This is called a hydrocele   Inflammation of the epididymis.
Testicle;102;This is called epididymitis   Spermatic cord torsion.
Testicle;103;This is also called Testicular torsion.
Testicle;104;It is a medical emergency.
Testicle;105;It is when the cord that the testicle hangs from gets twisted.
Testicle;106;It can happen when running.
Testicle;107;Varicocele - swollen veins to the testes.
Testicle;108;Varicocele happens more on the left.
Testicle;109;Loss and injury   Most boys are born with two testicles in the scrotum.
Testicle;110;The testicles have formed inside the baby's body, but moved into the scrotum before the birth.
Testicle;111;Sometimes one or both the testicles are still inside when the baby is born.
Testicle;112;Sometimes an operation is needed to fix this.
Testicle;113;If a testicle is injured, it is extremely painful.
Testicle;114;Sometimes testicles get crushed.
Testicle;115;Sometimes it is necessary for a doctor to remove one or both the testicles.
Testicle;116;This operation is called an orchidectomy.
Testicle;117;If a man loses a testicle, a doctor can put a testicular prosthesis (false testicle) into the scrotum.
Testicle;118;It looks and feels like a testicle.
Testicle;119;If a male loses both his testicles it's called castration.
Testicle;120;Because the man cannot produce sperm or testosterone, it has a big effect on the man's life.
Testicle;121;Because he cannot make sperm, he cannot have children.
Testicle;122;And because he cannot make the male hormone testosterone, he becomes less like a male.
Testicle;123;He may lose some of his muscles, and put on weight.
Testicle;124;A man who has lost his testicles may take testosterone medicine so that he does not have these changes.
Testicle;125;Until the 1700s in Europe, and more recently in some countries, there was a custom to castrate young male slaves and boys.
Testicle;126;Young slaves were castrated so that they could be used as guards over the wives of rich men.
Testicle;127;It meant that the wives would not fall in love with their guards.
Testicle;128;Sometimes young boys who had beautiful singing voices were castrated before puberty.
Testicle;129;This meant that their voices would stay high all their lives.
Testicle;130;These singing men were called castrati.
Testicle;131;Castrating animals   It is very common to castrate (remove the testicles from) male domestic animals.
Testicle;132;Male dogs and cats that are castrated do not fight so much, and do not stray around looking for females to mate with.
Testicle;133;Male horses are usually castrated so that they become more calm and safer to ride.
Testicle;134;A castrated male horse is called a gelding.
Testicle;135;A male horse that is not castrated is a stallion.
Testicle;136;Male animals that are used for meat are generally castrated because it makes them fatter and also makes them quieter to keep because they do not fight each other.
Testicle;137;Most male cattle are castrated.
Testicle;138;"Testicles can also be called "" testes "" or "" gonads "" ."
Testicle;139;There are many slang words for testicles, like balls, nuts, bollocks, nads, crown jewels, testies, marbles, ding dangs, boy toys, nicnaks, plums,tattay (in Urdu) etc.
Testicle;140;Slang words are other names that are used for fun or to be vulgar (rude).

Ulcer;1;An ulcer is a kind of open wound.
Ulcer;2;Ulcers can be on surfaces of the body.
Ulcer;3;They can be on skin.
Ulcer;4;They can be mucous membranes like the surface of the stomach or inside the mouth.
Ulcer;5;Ulcers start when the top layer (surface) of skin or mucous membrane is hurt.
Ulcer;6;This top layer dies.
Ulcer;7;When it dies, the skin or mucous membrane and opens.
Ulcer;8;This leaves an open sore called an ulcer.
Ulcer;9;Ulcers can be from infection with germs.
Ulcer;10;Ulcers can be from pressure on a part of the skin.
Ulcer;11;Ulcers can be from substances that will burn skin or mucous membranes.
Ulcer;12;Peptic ulcers are sometimes from burning by the acid in the stomach.
Ulcer;13;Ulcers can be from cancer.
Ulcer;14;Ulcers can be from diseases of blood vessels.
Ulcer;15;If not enough blood goes to a body part, it can get an ulcer.
Ulcer;16;Stress can also sometimes cause ulcers.
Ulcer;17;Ulcers are often very painful.
Injury;1;Injury means a harm or hurt.
Injury;2;Usually an injury is when the body or a part of the body is damaged by something outside of the body.
Injury;3;Another word for injury to a body is trauma.
Injury;4;Injury can be by:   Environmental – Burns from heat or injury from cold   Penetrating injury – when a sharp object like a knife pierces the body   Blunt injury – when something hits the body (like punching someone or falling from a tree)   Chemical – being hurt by chemicals like burns from acid   Injury can be accidental or intentional.
Injury;5;Intentional injury is when someone tries to hurt another person.
Injury;6;(Intentional injury is also called non-accidental injury) Accidental injury is when no one means to hurt someone else.
Injury;7;An example of accidental injury is a car wreck.
Pain;1;Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick.
Pain;2;It is a bad sensation that is physical and emotional.
Pain;3;Most pain starts when part of the body is hurt.
Pain;4;Nerves in that part send messages to the brain.
Pain;5;Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged.
Pain;6;Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain.
Pain;7;It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage.
Pain;8;The message that the nerve sends to the brain is called nociception.
Pain;9;What is experienced because of the nociception is pain.
Pain;10;Pain can be acute or chronic.
Pain;11;Acute means it only happens a short time.
Pain;12;Chronic means the pain lasts a long time.
Pain;13;Pain can be from different types of injury:   Cutaneous pain is from damage to the skin.
Pain;14;This is the pain a person feels when their wrist is cut with a knife.
Pain;15;Visceral pain is from damage to the organs inside the body – like the stomach, kidney, and heart.
Pain;16;This is the pain a person feels when they have an ulcer.
Pain;17;Somatic pain is from muscles, bones, and joints.
Pain;18;This is the pain a person feels when they sprain (twist) a joint like the ankle.
Pain;19;Pain can also happen when there is no underlying injury or cause.
Pain;20;Pain can happen just because the nerves do not work right.
Pain;21;This is called neuropathic pain.
Pain;22;For most pain, the best treatment is to stop the damage that makes the pain.
Pain;23;If the ankle is sprained, doctors tell the person not to walk on it.
Pain;24;They tell them to put ice on it.
Pain;25;This helps the injury stop.
Pain;26;For an ulcer in the stomach, doctors stop the acid made in the stomach.
Pain;27;This helps the ulcer to heal.
Pain;28;But many kinds of pain also need medicines to feel better.
Pain;29;There are many different kinds of medicines for pain:   NSAIDs (acronym for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).
Pain;30;These medicines decrease the inflammation where the person is hurt.
Pain;31;They also work in the brain to decrease pain.
Pain;32;Examples are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.
Pain;33;These medicines can make someone sleepy but they are not addictive.
Pain;34;They can cause problems with kidneys and with peptic ulcers.
Pain;35;Opioids are narcotic pain relievers.
Pain;36;They do not have the kidney and stomach problems that NSAIDs have.
Pain;37;But they can make someone very sleepy and have other potential side effects, such as lack of coordination, inability to concentrate, blurred vision, and weight gain.
Pain;38;They can be addictive.
Pain;39;Acetaminophen (e.g.
Pain;40;Tylenol) is not a narcotic or an NSAID.
Pain;41;So it is much safer than either one, but can cause liver damage.
Pain;42;Anti-seizure medicines (also called antiepileptics or anti-convulsants) – many of these medicines work for chronic neuropathic pain.
Pain;43;Other pain medicines may not work at all for those kinds of pain.
Pain;44;Examples are carbamazepine and gabapentin.
Pain;45;Anti-depression medicines can also help chronic pain, even if it is not neuropathic pain.
Pain;46;This is partly because of an affect on pain itself.
Pain;47;But it also helps, because living in chronic pain can cause depression.
Pain;48;There are doctors who specialize in pain management.
Pain;49;These are usually anesthesiologists but may also have any one of a number of underlying areas of specialization, such as neurology, physiatry, or internal medicine.
Pain;50;A new genetic method of treating chronic pain is in the research stage.
Pain;51;The idea is to inactivate (turn off) gene HCN2, which plays a key role in chronic pain.
Pain;52;Experiments on mice suggest this will work.

Testicular cancer;1;Testicular cancer is cancer in one or both testicles, a part of the male reproductive system.
Testicular cancer;2;In the United States, about 8,000 to 9,000 people are diagnosed with the cancer every year.
Testicular cancer;3;Every male has a 1 in 250 (four tenths of one percent, or 0.4%) chance of being diagnosed with it.
Testicular cancer;4;It is most common among males aged 15-40 years.
Testicular cancer;5;"Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers; more than 90%."
Testicular cancer;6;This is most often achieved by removing one or both testicles.
Testicular cancer;7;Even in the small number of cases where the cancer has spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 50%.
Testicular cancer;8;Because testicular cancer is curable (stage I can have a success rate of > 95%) when detected early, experts recommend regular monthly testicular self-examination after a hot shower or bath, when the scrotum is looser.
Testicular cancer;9;Men are advised to feel each testicle, feeling for pea-shaped lumps.
Testicular cancer;10;Symptoms of testicular cancer include one or more of the following:   a lump in one testis or a hardening of one of the testicles   pain and tenderness in the testicles   build-up of fluid in the scrotum   a dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin   a change in the size of a testicle   blood in semen   How bad the cancer is and whether it is present at all is often discovered through ultrasound of the testicles, x-rays, and/or CT scans.
Testicular cancer;11;Blood tests are also used to identify and measure tumour markers that are only in a person's blood if they have testicular cancer.
Testicular cancer;12;Biopsies should not be performed because it increases the risk of migrating cancer cells into the scrotum.
Pneumoconiosis;1;Pneumoconiosis is a form of occupational lung disease that is not infective.
Pneumoconiosis;2;It is a progressive (gets worse with time) degenerative disorder.
Pneumoconiosis;3;It is caused by air pollution in the form of tiny particles.
Pneumoconiosis;4;It was common among coal miners, who inhaled coal dust regularly.
Pneumoconiosis;5;Another type of pneumoconiosis is 'asbestosis', caused by inhaling asbestos fibres.
Pneumoconiosis;6;A third type is caused by inhaling very small silica particles, called 'silicosis'.
Pneumoconiosis;7;All forms of pneuomoconiosis shorten life, and have no cure.
Pneumoconiosis;8;Indications:   #Having worked at an occupation with dust risks   #Shortness of breath   #Chest X-ray may show typical signs   Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by the breathing-in of very small particles of sand or quartz dust found in volcanoes.
Pneumoconiosis;9;It was first seen in the Oxford English Dictionary, in 1936.
Pneumoconiosis;10;"It is "" an artificial long word "" , invented by in 1935 by Everett Smith, president of the National Puzzlers' League (N.P.L."
Pneumoconiosis;11;), at its annual meeting.

Toothache;1;A toothache is a pain felt in a person's tooth, normally when the tooth is hurt.
Toothache;2;A tooth can be hurt by tooth decay caused by plaque or by an injury.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;1;Obsessive–compulsive disorder (often shortened to OCD) is a mental disorder that causes repeated and unwanted thoughts and/or feelings (obsessions) and actions (compulsions).
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;2;Anxiety is one of the most common symptoms and can lead the individual to believe that if a task is not completed, something bad may happen.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;3;Such a task may be washing hands many times.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;4;This belief leads to more anxiety and tension.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;5;The actions that someone takes to stop the thoughts and feelings can take more than an hour every day.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;6;OCD can limit one's ability to take part in relationships, the workplace, and in society in general.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;7;OCD affects around 1.2% of the world's population, and it affects the lives of around 15%.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;8;In the United States, about one in fifty adults has OCD.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;9;Someone with obsessive–compulsive disorder has thoughts called obsessions.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;10;A thought that is an obsession will happen many times and is a thought that the person does not want to have.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;11;Different people will have different obsessive thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;12;Some people have obsessions about God, the Devil, or another religious figure hurting them or someone they love.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;13;Other people have obsessions about sex.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;14;They may think about things like kissing, having sex with, or touching people around them.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;15;People with OCD may worry that they will act on these thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;16;Some people have obsessive–compulsive disorder without compulsions.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;17;"This is called "" primarily obsessional OCD "" , or "" pure-O "" ."
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;18;It is thought that up to half of all people with obsessive–compulsive disorder have primarily obsessional OCD.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;19;"People with primarily obsessional OCD may have a third type of obsession; that is aggressive thoughts."
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;20;People with aggressive thoughts may have obsessions about hurting or killing themselves or people around them.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;21;Instead of performing compulsions, people with primarily obsessional OCD may act out compulsions in their mind or avoid the things and places that cause the obsessions.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;22;Many people with obsessive–compulsive disorder act in a certain way to stop the obsessive thought.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;23;These specific actions are known as compulsions.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;24;To someone with obsessive–compulsive disorder, doing these compulsions are a way to stop the obsessive thought.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;25;They may also think that doing the compulsion will stop something bad from happening to them or someone they care about.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;26;Many compulsions are similar to body tics, and up to 40% of people with obsessive–compulsive disorder have a tic disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;27;Some examples of compulsion include:   Hand washing   Cleaning themselves or things around them   Doing something (like turning lights on and off) a certain number of times   Putting objects in certain orders   Counting to a certain number many times   Checking that they did some action, usually checking a certain number of times   People with obsessive–compulsive disorder usually know that their compulsions do not make sense, but do them anyways to stop the feelings of panic or anxiety.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;28;People with obsessive–compulsive disorder may do their compulsions for hours every day.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;29;Their compulsions can also hurt them, such as compulsive hand washing making their hands red and cut.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;30;The cause of obsessive–compulsive disorder is unknown.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;31;There is evidence that genes have a strong role in developing the disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;32;If the disorder starts in childhood, it is more likely that other family members will have OCD than if the disorder starts in adulthood.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;33;It is thought that obsessive–compulsive disorder is the result of things humans did when they were evolving.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;34;There are four DSM diagnostic criteria for obsessive–compulsive disorder:   The person has to have obsessions, compulsions, or both.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;35;The DSM defines obsessions as thoughts that happen multiple times that the person does not want.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;36;The person has to try to get rid of the thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;37;The DSM defines compulsions as actions done multiple times because of an obsession.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;38;These actions are done to reduce the stress caused by an obsession.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;39;The obsessions or compulsions take a lot of time or cause lots of problems in the person’s life.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;40;The symptoms are not caused by a drug or a different medical problem.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;41;The problems are not closer to the problems caused by other mental disorders such as an anxiety disorder or body dysmorphic disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;42;There is another mental disorder similar to obsessive–compulsive disorder called Obsessive–Compulsive Personality Disorder or OCPD.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;43;The difference between the two is that people with obsessive–compulsive disorder know that something is wrong and become stressed because of their obsessive thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;44;People with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder do not know that something is wrong, and they like their obsessions and compulsions.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;45;Behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are used to help people with obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;46;The therapy works by making people be in places where they have their obsessive thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;47;They are then made to not do their compulsion.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;48;Over time, the person becomes used to the place or things that causes them to have their obsessive thoughts.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;49;An example of this is someone who is afraid of dirt having dirt put on their hands without being able to wash it off.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;50;"The medicines that are usually used are called "" selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors "" , or SSRIs."
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;51;These medicines work by stopping a chemical in the brain called serotonin from working.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;52;This causes the obsessive thoughts to happen less.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;53;In adults, SSRIs are used for people with moderate or severe issues.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;54;In children, SSRIs are used after or with therapy for people with severe issues.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;55;If SSRIs do not work, it is possible for a doctor to give someone with obsessive–compulsive disorder anti-psychotic medicines.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;56;Doctors may use both medication and counseling for those with the disorder, and they find that this approach works best.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;57;Surgery can be used to help people if other treatments do not work.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;58;In the United States, surgery is not done unless medicine and therapy have not worked multiple times.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;59;In the United Kingdom, surgery cannot be done unless cognitive behavioral therapy has not worked.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;60;Therapy can be used to reduce the compulsions in children and young adults.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;61;Family involvement is very important in treating children.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;62;Family also can give the child positive reinforcement for not doing their compulsive behaviors.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;63;In Europe from the 14th to 16th centuries, it was thought that people who had obsessive thoughts were possessed.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;64;They would treat these people by performing sometimes dangerous exorcisms to remove the Devil or evil spirit from the person.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;65;In the 1910s, a doctor named Sigmund Freud said that obsessive–compulsive disorder was because of fighting in someone's head.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;66;"He said that these fights start in childhood when someone gains a "" touching phobia "" , which fights with the natural want to touch things."
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;67;There are several movies and television shows that show people with obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;68;The movie The Aviator shows the life of Howard Hughes.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;69;Hughes was afraid of germs, and his obsessions and compulsions were about keeping germs away.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;70;English footballer David Beckham has talked about his obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder;71;Television hosts Howie Mandel and Marc Summers have also talked about their obsessions and compulsions.
Anthrax;1;Anthrax, or splenic fever, is a disease.
Anthrax;2;Both humans and other animals can get it.
Anthrax;3;It is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis.
Anthrax;4;It is common with even-toed ungulates (some hoofed creatures, like camels and giraffes).
Anthrax;5;The spores of the bacteria can live for hundreds of years.
Anthrax;6;Humans usually catch the disease from animals.
Anthrax;7;It is usually not passed from one human to another.
Anthrax;8;Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics.
Anthrax;9;There is also a vaccine against it.
Anthrax;10;If not treated, anthrax often leads to death.
Anthrax;11;There are 89 different strains (kinds) of anthrax.
Anthrax;12;One of them, the Ames strain, was used against the United States in 2001 as a biological weapon.
Anthrax;13;On April 2, 1979, there was a leak at one of the plants just outside of Sverdlovsk that made anthrax during the Cold War.
Anthrax;14;94 people were infected and 64 of those people died.
Anthrax;15;The USSR blamed the deaths on another strain of anthrax that the people caught by digesting infected meat.
Anthrax;16;However, later it was revealed that the outbreak was caused by an accidental release of the bacteria from a nearby plant which developed biological weapons for the USSR.
Anthrax;17;In September 2001, several letters containing anthrax were mailed to several USA media companies and senators.
Anthrax;18;The attacks were linked to the September 11 attacks which occurred a few days before the start of the attack.
Anthrax;19;There were many cases of fake powder being found in envelopes.
Epididymitis;1;Epididymitis is a painful inflammation of the epididymis, usually resulting from bacterial infection, but also occasionally caused by injury or viral infection.
Asthma;1;Asthma (or Asthma bronchiale) is a disease that hurts the airways inside the lungs.
Asthma;2;The more acetaminophen children took the higher their risk of getting asthma.
Asthma;3;Early warning signs of an asthma attack are physical changes in health that a person with asthma has before they have the attack.
Asthma;4;As of 2011, 235–300 million people worldwide are affected by asthma, and approximately 250,000 people die per year from the disease.
Asthma;5;Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%.
Asthma;6;The amount of asthma cases reported each year has gotten much higher between the 1960s and 2008 Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world.
Asthma;7;Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and 5% of people in the United Kingdom.
Asthma;8;Canada, Australia and New Zealand have rates of about 14–15%.

Crohn's disease;1;Crohn's disease is a disease that causes the intestines to become swollen.
Crohn's disease;2;It is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Crohn's disease;3;The intestines may also develop ulcers.
Crohn's disease;4;People with Crohn's disease often have pain in the stomach, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss.
Crohn's disease;5;Crohn's can also cause skin rashes, arthritis, and swollen eyes.
Crohn's disease;6;It is named after Burrill Bernard Crohn, who described cases in 1932.
Crohn's disease;7;It was first   described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) in the 18th century.
Crohn's disease;8;Nobody knows exactly what causes Crohn's disease.
Crohn's disease;9;In the disease, the person's body attacks itself.
Crohn's disease;10;The immune system attacks healthy parts of the digestive tract.
Crohn's disease;11;This causes swelling in the digestive tract.
Crohn's disease;12;Though Crohn's is an immune-related disease, it is not an autoimmune disease (the immune system is not triggered by the body itself).
Crohn's disease;13;The exact underlying immune problem is not clear.
Crohn's disease;14;Crohn's disease seems to be connected to the person's genes.
Crohn's disease;15;People whose brothers or sisters have the disease are the most likely to get it.
Crohn's disease;16;Men and women can both be affected by Crohn's disease.
Crohn's disease;17;Managing Crohn's disease includes both lifestyle changes and various kind of medication.
Crohn's disease;18;It is a chronic condition for which there is no cure.
Crohn's disease;19;Certain parasitic intestinal worms appear to make the bowel less inflamed.
Crohn's disease;20;It is supposed that the worms modify the immune reactions in the parts of the intestine where they live.
Crohn's disease;21;Alternative medicine of various kinds has been tried, with uncertain results.

Headache;1;A headache is when your head hurts.
Headache;2;It is not when you hit your head with something and made it hurt that way, but when your head hurts from inside.
Headache;3;A headache can be caused by one of several things, which are listed here:   Fever   Watching television or looking at a computer screen for a long time.
Headache;4;Being tired or sleepy.
Headache;5;As an effect of stress   By other neurological conditions ('neurological' means touching the nerves and the brain), like with epilepsy   The second edition of the International Headache Classification (ICHD-2) defines more than 220 different types of headaches in three categories:   Primary headaches, for example migraine, tension headache and cluster headache.
Headache;6;Secondary headaches   Cranial neuralgias, central and primary facial pain and other headaches   Many headaches can be relieved with analgesics like aspirin.
Headache;7;Brain tumor   Lyme disease   Influenza   Brain metastasis   Foodborne Intoxication   Sinusitis   Meningitis   Encephalitis   In many cases headaches can be relieved naturally.
Headache;8;Many methods such as massaging the temples near the eye, exercising your eyes (blinking, palming) and walking can all help relieve the tension of headaches.
Headache;9;Maintaining a healthy diet, with rich proteins and iron, can keep your brain awake and healthy.
Headache;10;One of the main factors is drinking plenty of water.
Headache;11;These natural techniques tend to give you long-term relief whilst medication can often give you short term relief.
Headache;12;"There are many medicines which can treat mild headaches, such as Paracetamol, Co-codamol, and Ibuprofen; but you should always consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any."
Fever;1;A fever is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit).
Fever;2;Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity.
Fever;3;It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius.
Fever;4;The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement.
Fever;5;For a temperature taken from under the tongue, the measurement may be lower.
Fever;6;Rectal temperatures will read about 0.3 C (0.55 F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower.
Fever;7;When people are ill, their body's immune system fights the disease, and so the body temperature rises.
Fever;8;Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises.
Fever;9;About 38 °C (100.4 F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 °C (103 F) degrees is a high-grade fever.
Fever;10;"Children usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature."
Fever;11;Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age.
Fever;12;Some animals, especially small ones like rabbits and cats, also have a higher normal temperature than humans.
Fever;13;Sometimes, high-grade fever can be a medical emergency.
Fever;14;At or above 42 °C (107.6 F) organs start taking damage that may not be repairable.
Fever;15;While most fevers are caused by Infection, whether bacterial or viral, some fevers can be caused by cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

Epilepsy;1;Epilepsy is a chronic condition of the brain.
Epilepsy;2;It is characterized by seizures that do not seem to have an obvious cause.
Epilepsy;3;To the outside viewer, these seizures show as episodes of heavy shaking.
Epilepsy;4;Depending on the seizure, the shaking may be short and difficult to detect or it may be longer.
Epilepsy;5;"People with epilepsy are sometimes called epileptic, but it is the fit or seizure that is "" epileptic "" ."
Epilepsy;6;Many people have died from seizures.
Epilepsy;7;There are many different forms of seizures, and there are also many different forms of epilepsy.
Epilepsy;8;Most forms of epilepsy cannot be cured.
Epilepsy;9;In most cases, drugs can make life easier for those suffering from it.
Epilepsy;10;In very few cases, (which are difficult to treat), surgery may help.
Epilepsy;11;In some cases, only eating special things (called a diet) may help.
Epilepsy;12;"A special diet has been developed; it is called Ketogenic diet."
Epilepsy;13;When it was developed, it was mainly used to treat certain children with epilepsy, before good drugs became available.
Epilepsy;14;Today, it is used to treat certain cases where drugs do not seem to help.
Epilepsy;15;Certain forms of the disease disappear after a time, they do for example only occur in childhood.
Epilepsy;16;Epilepsy is not one condition.
Epilepsy;17;Rather, it stands for a number of health problems that all show in the same ways.
Epilepsy;18;"The condition is very common; about one percent of people worldwide (65 million) have epilepsy."
Epilepsy;19;Nearly eighty percent of all cases occur in developing countries.
Epilepsy;20;Epilepsy becomes more common as people age.
Epilepsy;21;In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in infants and the elderly.
Epilepsy;22;In the developing world this is in older children and young adults.
Epilepsy;23;Between five and ten percent of all people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of eighty.
Epilepsy;24;The chance of having a second seizure is between forty and fifty percent.
Epilepsy;25;The condition has many forms, but generally the following is true:   People may get muscular seizures or convulsions.
Epilepsy;26;People lose control over their body.
Epilepsy;27;Feces may be released in the process.
Epilepsy;28;They may fall to the floor and hurt themselves when they are standing or walking.
Epilepsy;29;People may become unconscious.
Epilepsy;30;Those affected usually are not aware of the seizure going on.
Epilepsy;31;People may not remember or know what happened to them.
Epilepsy;32;In some cases, people may sense that a seizure is about to occur.
Epilepsy;33;This special feeling is called aura.
Epilepsy;34;Afterwards, people may remember the aura, but not the seizure itself.
Epilepsy;35;Most seizures only last a short time, the exception to this is called status epilepticus (a long seizure, lasting over five minutes).
Epilepsy;36;"Reflexes do not work while people are having a seizure; they may also stop breathing."
Epilepsy;37;People are tired after a seizure.
Epilepsy;38;They may be confused.
Epilepsy;39;People who suffer from epilepsy are not mentally ill.
Epilepsy;40;The condition is very common, and has been studied a lot.
Epilepsy;41;There are drugs for many forms of epilepsy that make life better for those affected.
Epilepsy;42;Doctors only say someone has epilepsy, if that person has had at least two seizures, for which the immediate cause cannot be seen.
Epilepsy;43;There are also seizures which are not caused by epilepsy.
Epilepsy;44;In most cases, epilepsy is caused by scars in the brain.
Epilepsy;45;Some forms of the condition are caused by genetic disorders, which may be passed on from the parents to the children.
Epilepsy;46;Very often, the actual cause for an epileptic seizure is lack of sleep, too much alcohol, or other things that cause stress.
Epilepsy;47;Many countries in the world say there are special rules for people who have epilepsy.
Epilepsy;48;They need to be without a seizure for some time before they may drive a car.
Epilepsy;49;They also need to take drugs to treat their illness.
Epilepsy;50;In many countries, such people may not drive buses, taxis or trucks.
Epilepsy;51;People having an epileptic seizure face a number of problems.
Epilepsy;52;The most common ones are:   They hurt themselves during the seizure.
Epilepsy;53;This includes broken bones, and wounds resulting from biting or hitting an object.
Epilepsy;54;They produce an accident during the seizure.
Epilepsy;55;This includes falling off a ladder, car accidents, and drowning while swimming.
Epilepsy;56;In some cases, people stop breathing.
Epilepsy;57;In such cases, the brain will be damaged, if the seizure lasts for a longer time, or there are multiple such seizures in a row.
Epilepsy;58;During the seizure, neurotransmitters are released in the brain.
Epilepsy;59;If their concentration is too high, the brain will take damage.
Epilepsy;60;In many cases, risky behaviour can provoke seizures.
Epilepsy;61;Such risk factors include   Stress   Lack of sleep   Alcohol, and other drugs   In many cases,a person who is able to cope with stress, who sleeps enough, and who does not drink too much can reduce the risk of having a seizure.
Dementia;1;Dementia is a group of diseases with symptoms, which affect the way people think and interact with each other.
Dementia;2;It can often be linked to a disease or damage done to the brain.
Dementia;3;Very often, short-time memory, mind, speech and motor skills are affected.
Dementia;4;Certain forms of dementia cause a change in the personality of the sufferer.
Dementia;5;A person suffering from dementia will lose certain skills and knowledge they already had.
Dementia;6;This is the main difference to other conditions affecting the mind.
Dementia;7;People who suffer from learning problems, or lower intelligence will never acquire certain skills, people suffering from dementia will lose skills they have acquired.
Dementia;8;Dementia is more common in older people, but younger people can be affected as well.
Dementia;9;Certain forms of dementia can be treated, to some extent.
Dementia;10;The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for between 50 and 60 percent of all cases.
Dementia;11;Other types include vascular dementia and lewy body dementia.
Dementia;12;Famous people who suffered from dementia include Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean leader, and also Rosa Parks, the civil rights activist.
Dementia;13;People who see the following worsen may suffer from dementia:   Decision-making ability   Judgment   Orientation in time and space   Problem solving   Verbal communication   Behavioral changes may include:   Eating   Dressing (may need assistance)   Interests   Routine activities (may become unable to perform household tasks)   Personality (inappropriate responses, lack of emotional control)   Some types dementia are reversible.
Dementia;14;This means the damage can be undone.
Dementia;15;Other types are irreversible.
Dementia;16;This means that they cannot be undone.
Dementia;17;Irreversible dementia is usually caused by an incurable disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.
Dementia;18;Reversible causes of dementia also include diffuse axonal injury after injuries to the head or the brain, known medically as Traumatic brain injury.
Dementia;19;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease causes a dementia that gets worse quickly, over weeks or months, and is caused by prions.
Dementia;20;,other forms like encephalopathy or delirium may develop relatively slowly, over a number of years.
Dementia;21;The two leading causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and Multi-infarct disease.
Dementia;22;Glioma related tumors are another kmown cause.
Dementia;23;Alcohol dementia, is sometimes associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and is caused by long-term or uncontrolled, heavy alcohol abuse.
Dementia;24;"Possible metabolic causes are such as liver failure or kidney failure; and chronic subdural hematoma."
Dementia;25;Possible other causes may include brain infection by illnesses like meningitis leading in cases to viral encephalitis drug toxicity (e.g.
Dementia;26;anticonvulsant drugs).
Dementia;27;A recent report by Science Daily says that researchers at the University of Bergen, in Norway have discovered a connection between Oral health and Alzheimers disease.

Insomnia;1;Insomnia is when people cannot sleep.
Insomnia;2;A person with this problem is called an insomniac.
Insomnia;3;Insomnia can mean a problem with getting to sleep or a problem with staying asleep.
Insomnia;4;Insomnia is a and not a disease or illness.
Insomnia;5;There are at least three different types of insomnia:   Transient Insomnia: this lasts from one night to a few weeks.
Insomnia;6;Acute Insomnia: lasts from a few weeks to about six months.
Insomnia;7;Chronic Insomnia: lasts for years at a time.
Insomnia;8;There are many causes of insomnia.
Insomnia;9;Some of them are:   As people get older, their sleep patterns change.
Insomnia;10;They will sleep shorter periods of time, but more often.
Insomnia;11;Younger people usually sleep longer.
Insomnia;12;This is normal.
Insomnia;13;Some insomnias are caused by stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine, cocaine and nicotine.
Insomnia;14;Coffee stimulates the body, and people tend to drink quite a lot of it when they are at work.
Insomnia;15;If they drink too much of it, they will have problems falling asleep in the evening.
Insomnia;16;(The same is true for tea, colas, or any other drink with caffeine in it.)
Insomnia;17;Some people worry a lot.
Insomnia;18;Their worries during the day will bother them at night.
Insomnia;19;They might have nightmares, or they may wake up sweating.
Insomnia;20;Some substances, like alcohol can have a bad effect.
Insomnia;21;It can be very hard to sleep after drinking a lot of alcohol.
Insomnia;22;The world may spin and there can be an urge to vomit as soon the person closes their eyes.
Insomnia;23;"Drugs can also have this effect, even some "" sleeping "" pills."
Insomnia;24;A very rare disease called fatal familial insomnia prevents some people from falling asleep.
Insomnia;25;In this disease, a person can no longer sleep and after a while will die from being so tired.
Insomnia;26;It is caused by a protein similar to the one that causes mad cow disease which is a very bad disease that comes from eating infected meat.
Insomnia;27;People with disorders of their circadian rhythms often have trouble sleeping at normal times.
Insomnia;28;Insomnia is a common symptom of some mental disorders: bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dementia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Insomnia;29;There are drugs available that can help treat the different kinds of insomnia.
Insomnia;30;In some cases, there are also certain herbs that can help.
Insomnia;31;A third way that seems to help is a type of therapy that aims at changing the behaviour of those affected.
Nightmare;1;A nightmare is a very powerful dream that the sleeper finds disturbing or frightening.
Nightmare;2;Nightmares usually have either physiological causes, like a high fever, or psychological ones, like trauma or stress in the sleeper's life.
Nightmare;3;Nightmares are common, but nightmares that happen very often can cause problems with sleep.
Nightmare;4;They may cause people to get medical help.
Nightmare;5;Nightmares usually happen during REM sleep.
Nightmare;6;In earlier times, people thought that such nightmares were really the work of demons.
Nightmare;7;They thought people were having nightmares because an Incubus was sitting on the chest of the sleeper.
Nightmare;8;This can also be seen on the image.
Nightmare;9;Sometimes people also thought magic and demonic possession were involved.
Nightmare;10;In the 19th century, people thought their diet was responsible.
Nightmare;11;"When Ebenezer Scrooge sees a ghost in A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, he thinks "" ... an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato... "" is responsible."
Nightmare;12;"Similarly, the Household Cyclopedia (1881) offers this advice about nightmares:   : "" Great attention is to be paid to regularity and choice of diet."
Nightmare;13;Intemperance of every kind is hurtful, but nothing is more productive of this disease than drinking bad wine.
Nightmare;14;Of eatables those which are most prejudicial are all fat and greasy meats and pastry...
Nightmare;15;"Moderate exercise contributes in a superior degree to promote the digestion of food and prevent flatulence; those, however, who are necessarily confined to a sedentary occupation, should particularly avoid applying themselves to study or bodily labor immediately after eating..."
Nightmare;16;Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night.
Nightmare;17;Passing a whole night or part of a night without rest likewise gives birth to the disease, as it occasions the patient, on the succeeding night, to sleep too soundly.
Nightmare;18;"Indulging in sleep too late in the morning, is an almost certain method to bring on the paroxysm, and the more frequently it returns, the greater strength it acquires; the propensity to sleep at this time is almost irresistible. """
Obesity;1;Obesity is the condition of being much too heavy for one's height so that one's health is affected.
Obesity;2;In other words, it means to be too overweight.
Obesity;3;Also known as being fat.
Obesity;4;It is considered a disease and has been described as an epidemic.
Obesity;5;To know if a person is overweight, the body mass index (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the person's weight (in kilograms), by their height (in meters) squared (multiplied by itself).
Obesity;6;(This is only meaningful for adults who are fully grown, and should not be used for children.
Obesity;7;Growth charts can be used to measure obesity in children.)
Obesity;8;A BMI between 18.5 and 25 is considered normal.
Obesity;9;"People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight; with 30 and above, they are considered obese, and with 35 and above, they are considered severely obese (this used to be called morbidly obese)."
Obesity;10;In general, the BMI number is a good quantifiable measurement of a person's obesity.
Obesity;11;However, it is a poor predictor in people who are very athletic, because a person with a higher than average amount of muscle tissue will weigh more than an average person, thus resulting in a BMI that is higher than normal, even if that person is very large.
Obesity;12;The most common cause for obesity is getting more calories than are used by the body.
Obesity;13;Other factors that often contribute to obesity are:   Poor nutrition   Hormonal problems (for example, caused by hypothyroidism)   Problems with the metabolism, e.g.
Obesity;14;weight cycling (the so-called yo-yo effect)   Eating disorders (for example, binge eating disorder)   Psychological problems, like depression   Lack of sleep or sleeping problems   Lack of exercise   Genetics are known to contribute to obesity.
Obesity;15;Leptin is a hormone that is linked to obesity.
Obesity;16;Many health problems are associated with obesity.
Obesity;17;An example is Type 2 diabetes.
Obesity;18;A woman with a BMI higher than 35 is 93 times more likely to develop diabetes.
Obesity;19;A 2009 review found that people with a BMI between 40 and 50 were 22.5 times more likely to die from diabetes than people with BMIs between 22.5 and 25.
Obesity;20;An obese woman is more likely to have an unhealthy baby.
Obesity;21;Risk is associated with where the excess fat is stored on the body.
Obesity;22;Abdominal obesity is particularly dangerous.
Obesity;23;Some people think that the idea that obesity causes bad health is not completely true and has been exaggerated.
Obesity;24;An example is J. Eric Oliver.
Obesity;25;He wrote a book called Fat Politics: The Real Story Behind America's Obesity Epidemic.
Obesity;26;There is evidence for this belief.
Obesity;27;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 2003 that 400,000 people died because of being obese in 2000.
Obesity;28;Then in 2004 they said that the number was wrong.
Obesity;29;A 2013 review of scientific papers found that Grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-34.9) is not associated with increased deaths.
Obesity;30;Grades 2 (BMI 35-39.9) and 3 (40+) obesity are associated with much higher rates of death.
Obesity;31;It has been suggested that obesity is associated with mortality (death) because of mortality in Grade 2 and 3 obesity.
Obesity;32;People with grade 2 and 3 obesity are 29% more likely to die.
Obesity;33;'Metabolically healthy obesity' is increasingly being recognized.
Obesity;34;Up to 40% of obese people are metabolically healthy.
Obesity;35;They are not more likely to get heart disease or die than metabolically healthy non-obese people.
Obesity;36;The 'obesity paradox' is a term used to describe how obesity can lower the risk of death.
Obesity;37;Obesity increases the chance of getting heart disease.
Obesity;38;But obese people with heart disease are less likely to die in a 7-year period.
Obesity;39;The obesity paradox has also been found in patients with stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Obesity;40;Scientists have not yet found a 'cure' for obesity that most people are willing to implement.
Obesity;41;It is common wisdom that people who lose weight will regain it all within 5 years.
Obesity;42;However, this position has been scientifically challenged for over a decade.
Obesity;43;Additionally, modern research has achieved significantly higher success rates than the figure that dominates the popular internet.
Obesity;44;Therefore, diet and exercise is the most common recommended treatment for obesity - it has the potential for a very high treatment success rate.
Obesity;45;Surgery can be used to treat obesity.
Obesity;46;Gastric bypass is the most common weight loss surgery.
Obesity;47;It makes a person's stomach smaller so that they feel full after eating less food and causes their body to absorb less calories.
Obesity;48;People who have surgery are usually very obese.
Obesity;49;Some people think that obesity should not be treated at all.
Obesity;50;This position is contradicted by substantial medical research.
Obesity;51;Weight loss medicines can make people want to eat less or make less of the energy from food be absorbed by their bodies.
Obesity;52;The only weight loss drug approved by the FDA for long term use is orlistat.
Obesity;53;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved other drugs because they have side effects.
Obesity;54;Also they are worried that people who are not obese will take them.
Obesity;55;In the West, people associate obesity with negative characteristics such as laziness, ugliness, stupidity, etc.
Obesity;56;These attitudes are increasing.
Obesity;57;Discriminating against someone because of their weight is legal in the United States.
Obesity;58;The fat acceptance movement says that this is wrong and is a kind of prejudice called fatphobia.
Obesity;59;In some cultures obesity is viewed as positive.
Obesity;60;It is associated with wealth, beauty, and fertility.

Influenza;1;Influenza, better known as the flu and sometimes called the grippe, is a common childhood illness, but is not as common among adults.
Influenza;2;It is not limited to humans, most mammals and many birds can also catch influenza.
Influenza;3;It is caused by several different viruses (see: RNA virus), which is why people can have the flu more than once.
Influenza;4;"The name influenza comes from , meaning "" influence "" ."
Influenza;5;Human Influenza can pass from one person to another very easily.
Influenza;6;It is most commonly spread by the microscopic droplets of mucus and fluid that are sent into the air when the sick person coughs or sneezes.
Influenza;7;Symptoms include cough, sore throat, muscle aches and pains, fever, headache, and rarely vomiting and diarrhoea.
Influenza;8;Influenza can also lead to other diseases, such as pneumonia.
Influenza;9;This makes it especially dangerous to young children and elderly people.
Influenza;10;Although there is no cure for influenza, Antiviral drugs can be used to treat the illness so it is not as severe and does not last as long.
Influenza;11;The influenza season runs from late fall to spring because most people catch it in the winter months.
Influenza;12;When there are more cases of influenza than expected, it will sometimes be called an epidemic.
Influenza;13;When there are a large number of cases of the same type of influenza all over the world, it is often called a pandemic.
Influenza;14;Small changes that happen as flu is passed from one person to another is the most common way flu viruses change.
Influenza;15;This is the main reason that people can catch the flu every year.
Influenza;16;The CDC keeps track of the different flu viruses that are circulating, and gives this information to the companies that make flu shots.
Influenza;17;Since the flu changes so much from year to year, flu shots have to be given for each new flu season.
Influenza;18;Flu shots only protect against the most common flu viruses, and every now and then a slightly different type spreads more than expected.
Influenza;19;Usually when this happens, the existing flu shot gives some protection so that even if a person who had a flu shot catches it, they do not get as sick.
Influenza;20;Some flu viruses are caught from animals.
Influenza;21;Bird flu, for example, is usually only caught by people in contact with sick birds (usually chickens).
Influenza;22;These types of flu virus are usually very limited, and while they can make a person very ill, usually other people do not catch the virus from the sick person.
Influenza;23;Another way that the flu can change is when a person or animal catches two different flu viruses.
Influenza;24;The two viruses can exchange some of their genetic information, which can create a brand new flu that nobody has ever caught before.
Influenza;25;If an animal flu virus changes in this way to one that can easily pass from human to human, many people become ill because nobody has any immunity to the new virus.
Influenza;26;Often, a brand new virus is more severe and kills more people.
Influenza;27;New types of flu virus are usually what causes pandemics, and that is the reason many scientists have been following Bird Flu so closely—it kills six people out of every ten who catch it.
Influenza;28;This would be a very serious problem if it changes enough to spread easily between people.
Influenza;29;This new flu virus got its name because it contains genetic parts that are commonly found in flu viruses that infect pigs.
Influenza;30;It is not spread by pigs or by eating pork—this is a new human virus being spread by humans.
Influenza;31;Although information is still coming out about swine flu, so far it does not seem to be as severe as bird flu or the flu that caused the influenza pandemic of 1918 (also known as Spanish flu), but it is much too early to predict whether it will cause the next flu pandemic.

Dyslexia;1;Dyslexia is a learning disability, a condition that makes it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do.
Dyslexia;2;A person can have dyslexia even if he or she is very smart or educated.
Dyslexia;3;"Recent studies show there are many small business owners that have dyslexia; between 35 and 50 percent of U.S. and British entrepreneurs are affected."
Dyslexia;4;Researchers think many dyslexic entrepreneurs are successful because they can delegate responsibilities (of writing letters) and still be good at speaking.
Dyslexia;5;At the end of the 19th century , scientists did a lot of research about dyslexia and found some of the reasons that people are dyslexic.
Dyslexia;6;A professor who did research in the 1980s and 1990s looked at the brains of dyslexic people who had died.
Dyslexia;7;He found that some parts of the brain were not connected very well, and that this happened during the fourth month of pregnancy.
Dyslexia;8;This problem has a big effect on the left half of the brain.
Dyslexia;9;The newest research shows that three genes are the reason for dyslexia.
Dyslexia;10;One thing that causes dyslexia is a problem with the central hearing nerve.
Dyslexia;11;This problem can not be found with a normal hearing test, so a special doctor has to do special tests to find it.
Dyslexia;12;It means that people with heavy dyslexia are sensitive to loud noise, may have problems speaking, and may not be able to concentrate.
Dyslexia;13;It may also cause problems with rhythm and melody of music.
Dyslexia;14;Many people who have dyslexia also have other mental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Dyslexia;15;In order to tell if a child has dyslexia, he or she has to be seen by a doctor.
Dyslexia;16;A child can be called dyslexic if he or she cannot read or write well and there is no other reason for the problem.
Dyslexia;17;Doctors are trying to create early tests to help find out whether a child has dyslexia before they are old enough to go to school.
Dyslexia;18;If this happens, a child can start to be treated very early, and they may have fewer problems at school.
Dyslexia;19;Many well-known people have dyslexia, including: Stephen Hawking , Jamie Oliver, Whoopi Goldberg, Ozzy Osbourne, Jay Leno, John de Lancie, Keira Knightley, Susan Hampshire, Orlando Bloom, Keanu Reeves, Richard Branson, Henry Winkler, Patrick Dempsey, Albert Einstein, and Tom Cruise.
Dyslexia;20;These people though continue to thrive with their work.
Dyslexia;21;Children with dyslexia can be helped.
Dyslexia;22;One way teachers help dyslexic students is to break words into different sounds.
Dyslexia;23;The student must learn how to write the different sounds and create words.
Dyslexia;24;This helps with reading and writing.
Dyslexia;25;Some people think that dyslexic children can read and write better if they put pieces of colored paper on top of what they are reading.

Cryptorchidism;1;"Cryptorchidism is a condition where one or both testicles does not drop down ( "" descend "" ) into the scrotum."
Bulimia nervosa;1;Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is a disease and a type of eating disorder.
Bulimia nervosa;2;It is when a person eats large amounts of food then will force themself to vomit it up or purge.
Bulimia nervosa;3;Other ways that they get it out of their body include laxatives and exercising.
Bulimia nervosa;4;Most who have it feel that they are fat and want to be skinny.
Bulimia nervosa;5;Most people with bulimia eat large amounts of food then make themselves vomit or purge.
Bulimia nervosa;6;Typically, they will do this at least once a week or more often.
Bulimia nervosa;7;Bulimic people often think about how their bodies look, and usually, the motive behind purging is the want to be skinny.
Bulimia nervosa;8;The person may also have anorexia nervosa.
Bulimia nervosa;9;However, most with bulimia have a normal weight or are overweight, which makes it difficult to know when someone has bulimia from just simply looking at them.
Bulimia nervosa;10;It is also common to have calluses or bruising on the fingers from purging.
Bulimia nervosa;11;Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems.
Bulimia nervosa;12;Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth.
Bulimia nervosa;13;One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body.
Bulimia nervosa;14;Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt.
Bulimia nervosa;15;The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems.
Bulimia nervosa;16;Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing.
Bulimia nervosa;17;This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles.
Bulimia nervosa;18;There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact.
Bulimia nervosa;19;Most people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25.
Bulimia nervosa;20;It is more common in females than it is in males.
Bulimia nervosa;21;People who have had past trauma are more likely to be bulimic.
Bulimia nervosa;22;People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also likely to have bulimia.
Bulimia nervosa;23;Anorexia nervosa
Scar;1;A scar is the natural result of a healing process in the human body.
Scar;2;When the dermis is hurt by a wound, the wounded tissue will be replaced by scar tissue.
Scar;3;Scar tissue is not identical to the tissue it replaces.
Scar;4;A scar will look different (and have different characteristics) than the surrounding tissue.
Nyctalopia;1;Nyctalopia (Greek for Night blindness) is a disease of the human eyes.
Nyctalopia;2;"The eyes of people who are night-blind cannot adapt to situations where there is relatively little light; as a result, they have trouble seeing in such situations."
Nyctalopia;3;"There are a number of conditions that can cause this; most commonly:   lack or deficiency of Vitamin A   Several genetic conditions, most notably retinitis pigmentosa   Wounds of the eye"
Hallucination;1;A hallucination is seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or feeling things that do not really exist.
Hallucination;2;Usually people have to be awake and conscious to have hallucinations.
Hallucination;3;That way, a person who sees or hears something that is not really there has a hallucination.
Hallucination;4;Hallucinations are different from dreams.
Hallucination;5;When people dream they are not awake.
Hallucination;6;Hallucinations are also different from illusions.
Hallucination;7;Illusions are based on real perceptions, which are distorted or interpreted in a wrong way.
Hallucination;8;Certain drugs can cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;9;Some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;10;Certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;11;In some cases, withdrawal of a drug can also cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;12;This has especially been reported by people trying to stop taking sleeping pills, or by alcoholics.
Hallucination;13;People who have hallucinations are not necessarily ill, lack of sleep can also cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;14;Hallucinations just before going to sleep or just after waking up are considered normal.
Hallucination;15;Hallucinations can affect all of a person's senses.
Hallucination;16;People with the mental illness of schizophrenia may hear sounds or voices that are not really there.
Hallucination;17;People with certain mental illnesses may also have hallucinations in which they see a person or thing which is not really there.
Hallucination;18;People are less likely to have hallucinations in which they smell or touch something that is not really there.
Hallucination;19;Certain forms of epilepsy can cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;20;Finally, hallucinations can be the result of certain substances taken or of certain physical constellations.
Hallucination;21;Most of the time, these substances are taken to get the hallucinations.
Hallucination;22;Sometimes, (severe) lack of sleep, or high fever can lead to hallucinations brought on by such viruses as the common cold.
Hallucination;23;Many studies have shown hallucinatory experiences take place across the world.
Hallucination;24;Several studies, one of them done as early as 1894, have reported that approximately 10% of the population experience hallucinations.
Hallucination;25;A recent survey of over 13,000 people reported a much higher figure.
Hallucination;26;According to the study, almost 39% of the people reported hallucinatory experiences.
Hallucination;27;27% of the people reported daytime hallucinations, mostly outside the context of illness or drug use.
Hallucination;28;From this survey, hallucinations affecting smell or taste seem the most common in the general population.
Hallucination;29;Some diseases such as brain disorders or infections may cause a person to have hallucinations.
Hallucination;30;"As well, an alcoholic (person who is addicted to alcohol) who stops drinking alcohol suddenly may experience a type of hallucinations called delirium tremens (or "" DT's "" )."
Hallucination;31;Some people have hallucinations if they do not sleep for a number of days, or if they do not eat for a number of days.
Hallucination;32;Some people have hallucinations because they purposefully or accidentally put chemicals or drugs into their bodies.
Hallucination;33;"Some people use illegal drugs that cause vivid hallucinations, such as LSD ( "" acid "" ) and PCP ( "" angel dust "" )."
Hallucination;34;Many kinds of drugs - even legal ones - will cause hallucinations, if very large doses are taken, and it is seen as a side effect.
Hallucination;35;Some legal drugs that dentists, doctors, or surgeons use cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;36;The dentists, doctors, and surgeons use drugs called anaesthetics to make people not feel pain, or to make people become unconscious.
Hallucination;37;But the drugs also have some other additional effects, which are called side effects, such as nausea (feeling sick) and hallucinations.
Hallucination;38;"Many dentists use an anaesthetic called nitrous oxide ( "" laughing gas "" )."
Hallucination;39;Inhaling large quantities of nitrous oxide can cause people to have hallucinations.
Hallucination;40;Doctors and surgeons use many types of anaesthetic gases so that patients who are being operated become unconscious.
Hallucination;41;When a person inhales anaesthetic gases, they may have hallucinations for several minutes, until they become unconscious.
Hallucination;42;Some adults accidentally swallow a poisonous chemical because it is in a bottle that has the wrong label.
Hallucination;43;In some cases, children swallow a poisonous chemical because they think that it is a food product or a drink.
Hallucination;44;Some dangerous, poisonous chemicals which can make people very sick or even kill them also cause hallucinations.
Hallucination;45;"Some people have hallucinations when they have not slept for a long time; other people have something resembling a hallucination before falling asleep."
Hallucination;46;This is usually called hypnagogia.
Hallucination;47;Most of the time, the people experiencing this kind of hallucinations are aware of the fact that they are not real.
Paranoia;1;Paranoia is a mental health condition that affects a person's thoughts.
Paranoia;2;A person with paranoia is called paranoid.
Paranoia;3;Paranoia is a thought process heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of irrationality and delusion.
Paranoia;4;A paranoid person's thinking is shaped by fear and anxiety.
Paranoia;5;"For example, the person may fear that other people are "" out to get them "" or are planning to hurt them."
Paranoia;6;They may believe that video cameras are watching them, or that a certain group (like the police or CIA) is following them.
Paranoia;7;They may also believe that other people can control their thoughts or use magic to hurt them.
Paranoia;8;Even if these fears seem strange or absurd to others, they feel very real to the person with paranoia.
Paranoia;9;They truly believe that they are in danger.
Paranoia;10;Paranoia is different from phobias.
Paranoia;11;In a phobia, someone has an irrational fear, but does not blame anyone for this fear.
Paranoia;12;A paranoid person will often make false accusations and say that something was intentional, when it was just coincidence or an accident.
Paranoia;13;If a person is truly paranoid, their fears must not be explained by common beliefs, like their religion.
Paranoia;14;For example, some religions say that people can use magic to hurt others.
Paranoia;15;So a person from one of those religions should not be diagnosed as paranoid just because he/she has this belief.
Paranoia;16;They would also have to have other paranoid beliefs - which could not be explained by religious beliefs - to be diagnosed with paranoia.
Paranoia;17;Very often, people with paranoia also have other thought disorders, or mood disorders.
Paranoia;18;Paranoia can be a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses.
Paranoia;19;"In everyday talk, people may use "" paranoid "" to mean more normal worries."
Paranoia;20;For example, someone may call a friend paranoid for thinking that his teacher hates him.
Paranoia;21;For example Nimra
Delusion;1;A delusion is a false belief held by a person.
Delusion;2;If doctors talk about delusions they mean that the false belief is the result of some disease, usually a disease of the mind, such as paranoia, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but not always neccesarily, delusions can come in many different forms such as political differences, economic differences such as a god complex upheld by someone who believes they are all powerful and many other types.
Delusion;3;Delusions also have other properties, according to Karl Jaspers:   They can not change (that is they are fixed)   Those holding the belief are absolutely certain of its truth.
Delusion;4;The beliefs may be implausible or bizarre.
Delusion;5;Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.
Delusion;6;Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.
Delusion;7;Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.
Delusion;8;A doctor or psychiatrist may say that a delusion is false, because it seems to be unlikely or bizarre.
Delusion;9;"Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims; this means that some true beliefs are erroneously classified as delusional."
Delusion;10;This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House.
Delusion;11;At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness.
Delusion;12;Only after the Watergate scandal was she proved right, and sane.
Delusion;13;Treating delusions is difficult, but in some cases antypsychotics can be used.
Delusion;14;If the delusions pose a risk to the health of the patient (if consented) or the health of others, people may also be treated against their will.
Premature ejaculation;1;Premature ejaculation (also known as PE) is a condition affecting many men.
Premature ejaculation;2;It is when during sexual intercourse (sex) the male can not stop himself from ejaculating after starting sex.
Premature ejaculation;3;The condition is usually curable or at least treatable by a few exercises.
Premature ejaculation;4;(There are more exercises than these, however, these are the most common.)
Premature ejaculation;5;One exercise is to create an erection and begin to lose it, then stimulate it again.
Premature ejaculation;6;This exercise is best done alone at first and then with a partner.
Premature ejaculation;7;Thrusting should not be used with a partner until very near the end of treatment.
Premature ejaculation;8;This treatment may take several weeks to fully cure the problem if it is used properly.
Premature ejaculation;9;Another treatment involves using the muscle which stops urine.
Premature ejaculation;10;To locate the muscle, simply begin urinating and stop quickly before emptying the bladder.
Premature ejaculation;11;Doing that, will demonstrate how to use the muscle.
Premature ejaculation;12;Then whenever convenient use the muscle.
Premature ejaculation;13;You do not need to be urinating to use the muscle and it is suggested you are not.
Premature ejaculation;14;After a few weeks of both these treatments, the PE will become more like traditional ejaculation and after about one and a half to two and a half months, it should be absolutely normal.
Constipation;1;Constipation is when it is very hard to pass stool (defecate): that is, get rid of digested food waste (feces).
Constipation;2;Constipation can be caused by many things.
Constipation;3;One is eating or drinking too much dairy products that use cow milk.
Constipation;4;To solve this problem many people use a laxative or eat defecation-inducing foods such as plums.
Constipation;5;Another possible cause could be an obstruction somewhere along the digestive tract (the path that food travels inside the body).
Constipation;6;A person suffers from constipation if he or she passes stool three times in a week or more seldom.
Constipation;7;People suffering from constipation may defecate only once or twice in a week, and their stool is very solid and tough.
Constipation;8;Normally people defecate daily.
Constipation;9;When a person is constipated their lower stomach and intestinal area will be blocked.
Constipation;10;People can usually conquer constipation by eating natural laxatives such a fruits, fruit juice and dietary supplements.
Constipation;11;Liquid will help get rid of constipation.
Constipation;12;Constipation can occur by eating hard food such as cheese or meat.
Constipation;13;A good way on preventing constipation is to eat foods which contain fiber such as whole grain   Papaya and guava is very rich in fiber and potassium should be consume after meal everydayGet rid of constipation .
Constipation;14;"The seven types of stool are:   :Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)   :Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy, and passing it feels very painful, "" like childbirth ""   :Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface   :Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft   :Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily)   :Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool   :Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces."
Constipation;15;"Entirely liquid   Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, with 3 and 4 being the "" ideal stools "" , especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5–7 tending towards diarrhoea."
Flatulence;1;Flatulence is when intestinal gas leaves the anus.
Flatulence;2;This often happens with a sound that can be embarrassing to some people, but in some cultures it is treated like humor.
Flatulence;3;The word flatuence comes from the Latin word flatus, which means blowing or breath, but people today usually call it farting.
Flatulence;4;In mammals like humans, the gases come from two sources: swallowed air (for example, while eating, talking or drinking) and gases naturally created by bacteria in the body during digestion.
Flatulence;5;Of the gases that come out during flatuence, most of it is nitrogen (which has the chemical formula N  and makes up between 20% to 90% of all the gases), followed by hydrogen (H), carbon dioxide (CO  ), oxygen (O  ) and methane (CH  ).

Anorexia nervosa;1;Anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia) is an eating disorder.
Anorexia nervosa;2;People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming fat even if they are very skinny.
Anorexia nervosa;3;To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough.
Anorexia nervosa;4;When they do eat, they do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight.
Anorexia nervosa;5;This causes them to lose too much weight too quickly.
Anorexia nervosa;6;This is very harmful to a person's body.
Anorexia nervosa;7;There are various treatments for anorexia.
Anorexia nervosa;8;One example is the Maudsley Method.
Anorexia nervosa;9;This type of treatment is for patients who are 18 or younger.
Anorexia nervosa;10;Two thirds of adolescent anorexia patients are 'recovered' at the end of this treatment.
Anorexia nervosa;11;People with anorexia are more likely to die than people with any other mental illness.
Anorexia nervosa;12;Doctors use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to make a medical diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not.
Anorexia nervosa;13;Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual.
Anorexia nervosa;14;People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia.
Anorexia nervosa;15;";Signs of anorexia   #People with anorexia do not want to keep a body weight and BMI that is normal for their age and height."
Anorexia nervosa;16;#People with anorexia think that they are fat.
Anorexia nervosa;17;They are afraid of gaining weight.
Anorexia nervosa;18;#People with anorexia have low self-esteem because of the shape or weight of their body.
Anorexia nervosa;19;Also, they do not think that low body weight is a problem.
Anorexia nervosa;20;#A woman with anorexia might not have their period multiple months in a row (one period is sometimes called a menstrual cycle).
Anorexia nervosa;21;They also must make sure the woman is not pregnant and has not had their periods stop permanently due to their age, which is called menopause.
Anorexia nervosa;22;"Rapid, unexplained weight loss   Refusal to maintain a healthy weight   Low self-esteem and distorted self-image   Frequent weighing, "" body-checking "" , or negative comments on appearance   Amenorrhoea, the loss of menstrual periods   Low body temperature   Low pulse, blood sugar and blood pressure   Depression   Total self-starvation   Heart attack or heart failure   Kidney failure   Electrolyte imbalance   Muscle and organ damage (when the body has no fat to live off of, it begins to digest muscle and tissue)   Suicide   There is no single cause of anorexia."
Anorexia nervosa;23;Researchers believe that it is caused by a combination of biological and environmental factors.
Anorexia nervosa;24;It has been linked to the media.
Anorexia nervosa;25;Many people think that anorexia is caused by wanting to be thin like models in magazines.
Anorexia nervosa;26;However, it is not that simple.
Anorexia nervosa;27;People who develop anorexia tend to be perfectionistic.
Anorexia nervosa;28;They are also more likely to have problems socializing.
Anorexia nervosa;29;There has been research about the link between anorexia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder that involves problems with socializing.
Anorexia nervosa;30;Another symptom of autism spectrum disorder is OCD, which has also been linked to anorexia.
Anorexia nervosa;31;Starvation is known to create antisocial behavior so there needs to be research that compares those traits in anorexics with people who have recovered.
Anorexia nervosa;32;Bulimia nervosa
Rabies;1;Rabies is a neurotropic (referring to the nuerons) virus, viral zoonotic disease (can spread to humans by animals) that causes acute encephalitis.
Rabies;2;Usually, people (and animals) die from it (it is fatal).
Rabies;3;There is no cure for it.
Rabies;4;People who are treated soon after becoming infected have a chance to survive.
Rabies;5;The disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood.
Rabies;6;The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal.
Rabies;7;Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries.
Rabies;8;There is no cure for Rabies.
Rabies;9;There is a vaccine (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it.
Rabies;10;The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux in 1885.
Rabies;11;This vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits, and weakened (through drying it).
Rabies;12;The first person to be vaccinated was Joseph Meister (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog).
Rabies;13;Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using cell cultures) are more used.
Rabies;14;There is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten.
Rabies;15;It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten.
Rabies;16;There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late.
Rabies;17;Treatment starts with washing the wound.
Rabies;18;This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body.
Rabies;19;Often patients are given one dose of immunoglobulin and a certain number of vaccines, over a determined period of time, usually a month.

Thyroid cancer;6;"Papillary   70% of all thyroid cancers   Slowly   Yes, but not quickly   People do well with treatment; patients under 45 rarely die from papillary thyroid cancer   Follicular   10-15% of all thyroid cancers   Slowly   Yes, through the bloodstream and into other organs, like the lungs   People do well with treatment; patients under 45 rarely die from follicular thyroid cancer   Medullary   4% of all thyroid cancers   Usually slowly   Yes, early on   People do well if the cancer is only in the thyroid gland, but not as well if it has spread to other body parts   Anaplastic   2% of all thyroid cancers   Quickest of all thyroid cancers   Yes, very quickly   Treatments often do not help this kind of thyroid cancer   Thyroid cancer can be diagnosed in a few different ways:   Basic Tests:   During a physical exam, a doctor can check for lumps or swelling in the neck; a larger-than-normal thyroid (goiter); and how the patient is feeling in general."
Thyroid cancer;7;Blood tests can check for levels of hormones released by other organs in the body.
Thyroid cancer;8;Special Tests:   Special scans, like CT scans, PET scans, MRIs, and radioiodine scans.
Thyroid cancer;9;These tests can find out where the thyroid cancer is, how big it is, and how far it has spread.
Thyroid cancer;10;Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: A thin needle, guided by an ultrasound, is put through the skin and into the thyroid.
Thyroid cancer;11;A biopsy is done: a sample of cells is taken out (aspirated) and checked for cancer.
Thyroid cancer;12;Ultrasound: If a person has a lump on their thyroid, an ultrasound can measure how big it is.
Thyroid cancer;13;Surgical biopsy: A surgeon can take out one side of the thyroid, or the whole thyroid, so it can be tested for cancer.
Thyroid cancer;14;(Sometimes, taking out the whole thyroid is also a treatment for thyroid cancer.)
Thyroid cancer;15;Thyroid scan: The patient takes a pill of radioactive iodine.
Thyroid cancer;16;(It is radioactive so the iodine can be seen on the test.
Thyroid cancer;17;The thyroid is supposed to be able to make iodine into thyroid hormones, so if the thyroid cannot do this because of cancer, the test will show it.)
Thyroid cancer;18;A special camera is used to get an image of the thyroid on a computer screen.
Thyroid cancer;19;This test is not used very often, since it is only useful in certain cases.
Thyroid cancer;20;2000: 28-year-old Colombian-American actress and model Sofía Vergara was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.
Thyroid cancer;21;She had her thyroid removed, underwent radioiodine therapy, and made a full recovery.
Thyroid cancer;22;2012: 27-year-old Russian singer and actress, former part of world-wide famous duo t. A.T.u, was diagnosed with stage I papillary thyroid cancer.
Thyroid cancer;23;She developed some thyroid problems after giving birth to her son Samir in 2007 and she do ultrasounds few times a year ever since to prevent serious health problems and eventually was diagnosed with early stage of cancer when her son was 4.
Thyroid cancer;24;She underwent surgery to the tumor, her thyroid was removed too.
Thyroid cancer;25;She later underwent hormonies treatment.
Thyroid cancer;26;Doctors damaged her voice nerve during the surgery and she lost her voice.
Thyroid cancer;27;She underwent multiple courses of treatments in Russia, Israel and Germany to get her voice back during the next year.
Thyroid cancer;28;She later was able to got her voice back in Korea.
Thyroid cancer;29;As of early April 2016 she was cancer-free.
Thyroid cancer;30;2013: Famous movie critic Roger Ebert died after suffering from the disease for nearly eight years.
Thyroid cancer;31;He had part of his lower jaw removed to prevent the cancer spread.
Thyroid cancer;32;However, in late 2012, the cancer spread to parts of his hip and bone.
Arachnophobia;1;Arachnophobia is a fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia;2;It is a very common phobia - many people suffer from it.
Arachnophobia;3;People who have it often feel uncomfortable in areas where there may be spiders.
Arachnophobia;4;The usual way of treating this is using behaviour therapy.
Arachnophobia;5;"People will be confronted with spiders; they may be required to touch spiders as big as a tarantula."
Phobia;1;A phobia (from the ) is a strong fear about a specific thing or situation.
Phobia;2;In psychology, phobia is considered an anxiety disorder.
Phobia;3;Phobia is different than just being scared of something.
Phobia;4;The fear is so strong that it affects, and often damages, the sufferer's life.
Phobia;5;For example, the person will usually do everything they can to avoid the thing they fear.
Phobia;6;If they cannot avoid that thing, they will suffer from very strong anxiety which can damage their social relationships, their ability to work, and other areas of their everyday life.
Phobia;7;There are two basic types of phobias: specific phobias and social phobias.
Phobia;8;People with specific phobias fear a certain thing, for example spiders (this is called arachnophobia) or high places (acrophobia).
Phobia;9;People with social phobias fear social situations (for example speaking in public, being in crowded areas, or being around other people).
Phobia;10;Fear is a normal human emotion.
Phobia;11;A phobia is different from normal fear in many ways:   #With phobias, a person fears something which is not really dangerous, or which is not anywhere near as dangerous as the person believes it is.
Phobia;12;For example, many humans fear spiders.
Phobia;13;However, a person with a phobia of spiders might panic when even thinking about a spider, refuse to leave home because they are too afraid of seeing a spider, or spend hours of each day making sure there are no spiders in their home.
Phobia;14;People with phobias realize that their anxiety is much more severe than normal fear would be.
Phobia;15;#Phobia lasts much longer than regular fear.
Phobia;16;For example, a person with a phobia of spiders might continue to feel severe anxiety for hours after seeing a spider.
Phobia;17;#When a person feels normal fear, their fear does not damage their life.
Phobia;18;Phobias cause problems in sufferers' daily lives.
Phobia;19;For example, they may damage important relationships or make it difficult for the person to work.
Phobia;20;People with social phobias may avoid being with other people or meeting new people.
Phobia;21;It is hard to tell how many people suffer from phobias.
Phobia;22;Researchers think that between 5 and 13 percent of people seem to have a phobia.
Phobia;23;Women suffer from phobias about twice as often as men.
Phobia;24;Every child is afraid of something.
Phobia;25;For most children, these fears eventually disappear.
Phobia;26;"Normal fears in children include:   0–2 years - loud noises; strange people; being away from their parents   3–6 years - imaginary things, for example ghosts and monsters; the dark; strange sounds   7–16 years - more realistic fears, for example school performance, injury, illness, death, and disaster   These fears would only be called phobias if they caused problems in the child's daily life, or if they caused the child to suffer from severe anxiety or emotional distress."
Phobia;27;Causes and risk factors phobias is very.
Phobia;28;"It can be caused by:   phobia occurs mostly in childhood   innate fear   traumatic event (assault, assault witness, injury ...)   hear about the possible danger (someone attacked animal; hear about a natural disaster ...)   family influence and culture   psychological personality disorder   a characteristic trait persons with a susceptible nature are more prone to phobias   parents' lack of interest   gender women are more prone to phobias   also psychological phobias."
Phobia;29;These include hundreds of types phobias.
Phobia;30;Some:   Aichmophobia - fear of sharp objects (like scissors or needles)   Bacillophobia - fear of bacteria   Claustrophobia - fear of small, closed-in spaces   Necrophobia - fear of death   Pharmacophobia - fear of medications   Taphophobia - fear of being buried alive   Blood-Injection-Injury phobias   Zoophobias - fear of one, several, or all animals.
Phobia;31;Specific phobias of animals include Arachnophobia (fear of spiders), Cynophobia (fear of dogs), Entomophobia (fear of insects), Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), and Scoleciphobia (fear of worms)   Sociophobia - fear of people and/or social situations   Glossophobia – fear of speaking in public   When a person with a phobia is exposed to their fear (encounters with the stimulus, think of it, sees the object of fear in the picture...) occur at these physical and psychological symptoms.
Phobia;32;Intensity depends on the degree of fear.
Phobia;33;Psychological symptoms are symptoms that take place within a human.
Phobia;34;These include the:   anxiety up to panic   want to run away   shaking or tremors   fear that the loss of their control, or to drive crazy   fear of death   fear of loss of consciousness   nervousness, restlessness   difficulty breathing, shortness of breath   heart beat, increased heart rate   shaking or tremors   more sweating   malaise, feeling sick   weakness up to fainting   rush hot or cold   dry mouth   pain or spin head   a need to go to the toilet   There are different ways to help people with phobias.
Phobia;35;"There is treatment available; it focuses on making the patient less sensitive to the fear they suffer from, or showing him or her how the cycle of fear works."
Phobia;36;There is also medication available (mostly sedatives) that help people cope.
Phobia;37;Finally there are self-help groups.

Childbirth;1;Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is the ending of pregnancy where one or more babies leaves the uterus by passing through the vagina or by Caesarean section.
Childbirth;2;In 2015, there were about 135 million births globally.
Childbirth;3;About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12 percent were born after 42 weeks.
Necrophilia;1;Necrophilia is a paraphilia of being sexually attracted to dead bodies.
Necrophilia;2;Some necrophiliacs have sex with dead bodies.
Necrophilia;3;It is usually considered bad.
Necrophilia;4;It is illegal in many parts of the world, but not all.

Narcolepsy;1;Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder.
Narcolepsy;2;It happens when the nervous system does not work properly.
Narcolepsy;3;People with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep during the daytime, even if they do not want to.
Narcolepsy;4;Very often, they do not sleep well at night, and during the day they fall asleep uncontrollably.
Narcolepsy;5;There are two different forms.
Narcolepsy;6;The classical (more common) form is the one with muscle failure (called cataplexy).
Narcolepsy;7;There is also a less common form without cataplexy.
Narcolepsy;8;Narcolepsy affects the way the nerves work.
Narcolepsy;9;It is not a mental illness, or caused by psychological problems.
Narcolepsy;10;It is estimated that between 25 and 50 people, per 100,000 suffer from narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy;11;Very few cases are reported.
Narcolepsy;12;The first description was given in 1877.
Narcolepsy;13;Jean-Baptiste Gélineau, a military doctor, first used the name narcolepsy in 1880.
Narcolepsy;14;In certain countries, people diagnosed with narcolepsy may not drive a car.
Narcolepsy;15;Things that people with narcolepsy may experience:   Excessive Daytime Sleepiness: Being very tired during the day even after a full night of sleep.
Narcolepsy;16;This is the most common symptom of narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy;17;Cataplexy: Suddenly having a muscle fail them.
Narcolepsy;18;This can range from a slight weakness, and problems speaking clearly, to completely collapsing.
Narcolepsy;19;Sleep paralysis: When waking up, people are paralysed (unable to move) for a certain time.
Narcolepsy;20;The paralysis eventually goes away.
Narcolepsy;21;Hallucinations, while falling asleep or waking up.
Narcolepsy;22;Automatic behaviour: People continue doing things while they are asleep.
Narcolepsy;23;Later on they do not remember.
Narcolepsy;24;Hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and automatic behaviour can also occur in people who are not narcoleptics.
Narcolepsy;25;This usually happens when people are very tired, and have not slept for a long time.
Narcolepsy;26;Some scientists think that narcolepsy is caused by a lack of hypocretin.
Narcolepsy;27;Hypocretin is a chemical in the brain which wakes people up and regulates sleep.
Narcolepsy;28;However, It is not yet known for sure what causes it.
Narcolepsy;29;Quite a few sufferers also have another family member with the disease.
Narcolepsy;30;This may point to the fact that some of the things that cause the disease may be passed from the parents to the children through genes.
Narcolepsy;31;There are certain drugs that can treat the effects of narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy;32;They can not treat the cause, since it is unknown.
Narcolepsy;33;In general those drugs are special kinds of stimulants.
Narcolepsy;34;General stimulants, like coffee, usually do not help.
Narcolepsy;35;"Some strategies for treatment do not rely on drugs:   Adapting the behaviour to avoid situations that trigger daytime sleep; this is generally known as Coping."
Narcolepsy;36;It also involves changing the daytime rhythm to accommodate the sleeping phases   Sleep hygiene   Narcolepsy Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke   Narcolepsy Network      Read about Narcolepsy in the Sleeptionary   What is Narcolepsy   Narcolepsy: Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment   Harvard Division of Sleep Medicine Module on Narcolepsy
Sleep paralysis;1;When people are dreaming, their muscles do not move, even if in their dream they are moving.
Sleep paralysis;2;This is a natural process which prevents that people actually perform the movements they do in their sleep.
Sleep paralysis;3;In general, people are not aware of this inability to move, as it usually stops as soon as they wake up.
Sleep paralysis;4;People suffering from sleep paralysis wake up and find that they are unable to move.
Sleep paralysis;5;This is because the paralysis has not stopped.
Sleep paralysis;6;"Usually it lasts for only a few minutes, and people have said they feel a "" presence "" or "" ghost "" during it."
Sleep paralysis;7;Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis.
Sleep paralysis;8;However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post-synaptic (neurons sending signals to other neurons) inhibition (restraint) of nerves in the pons (back) region of the brain.
Sleep paralysis;9;In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which stops stimulation of the muscles.
Sleep paralysis;10;Hallucinations of ghosts, demons and Out of Body Experiences during sleep paralysis may be caused by a part of the brain called the parietal lobe (top-middle part of the brain), and by neurons known as mirror neurons.
Sleep paralysis;11;Studies suggest that many people get sleep paralysis at least once in their lives.
Sleep paralysis;12;People who have narcolepsy often get it much more.
Sleep paralysis;13;Many people try to induce sleep paralysis, to have an Out of Body Experience.
Sleep paralysis;14;Some report that various factors make paralysis and hallucinations happen more.
Sleep paralysis;15;"These include:   Sleeping on your back   Irregular sleeping schedules; naps, sleeping in, sleep deprivation   Increased stress   Sudden changes of lifestyle or environment   A lucid dream just before it   Medium to long-term imagining of involuntary movements with your eyes closed before sleep."
Sleep paralysis;16;There are few treatments available for sleep paralysis.
Sleep paralysis;17;One treatment is called Meditation-Relaxation Therapy.
Sleep paralysis;18;"The treatment includes four steps: (1) one should close one's eyes and remind oneself that the experience is not dangerous in any way and common around the world; (2) and that since it is not dangerous one should not be afraid as that will only make the experience worse."
Sleep paralysis;19;"(3) One should then focus very strongly on a positive thought or mental image (meditate); (4) and also relax ones muscles and avoid movement."

Herpes simplex;1;The herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a virus.
Herpes simplex;2;It causes two common diseases.
Herpes simplex;3;Both diseases have painful, watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes (such as the mouth or lips) or on the genitals.
Herpes simplex;4;The disease is contagious, particularly when the disease is active.
Herpes simplex;5;Contagious means that it can spread from one person to another.
Herpes simplex;6;It is not possible to stop this disease completely after it has started in a person.
Herpes simplex;7;However, there are some medical treatments that stop the disease for a little while.
Herpes simplex;8;An infection on the lips is commonly known as a cold sore or fever blister.
Herpes simplex;9;A cold sore is not the same as a canker sore, which appears inside the mouth and is caused by something else.
Addiction;1;Addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right.
Addiction;2;When you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict.
Addiction;3;People can be addicted to drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and many other things.
Addiction;4;When somebody is addicted to something, they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to.
Addiction;5;But taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health.
Addiction;6;Some people who are addicts need to go to a doctor or hospital to cure the addiction, so they no longer crave (want or need) the drug.
Addiction;7;Addiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body.
Addiction;8;"The blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain, and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it; then they want more of that substance."
Addiction;9;"This takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine; but all of them control the consumer."
Addiction;10;Once under this control, the consumer does not have a completely free will, and listens to the addiction's bidding.
Addiction;11;People can also be addicted to other things which are not drugs.
Addiction;12;"You may hear people talk about being "" addicted to the Internet "" or "" addicted to chocolate "" or gambling."
Addiction;13;This means that they get into a habit of enjoying that thing, so if they have to go without it for a while, they miss it a lot.
Addiction;14;Addiction is similar to a major disease like chronic heart disease or perhaps diabetes, but addictions are not taken as seriously as these major diseases.
Addiction;15;Most people believe addiction to be a lifestyle choice, which in fact it is but it is also part of a person's genetics.
Addiction;16;While some people can do things and control themselves others cannot due to their genetic makeup.
Addiction;17;There are ways of helping the addict but this takes the admission of a problem and then proper testing to reveal what kind of treatment is needed.
Addiction;18;The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences.
Addiction;19;People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.
Addiction;20;Prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases.

Smallpox;1;Smallpox was a very dangerous disease with a high mortality rate.
Smallpox;2;It is caused by a virus.
Smallpox;3;There are two different species of viruses that can cause the disease.
Smallpox;4;They are Variola major and Variola minor.
Smallpox;5;"Some people also call smallpox Variola, from the Latin work for "" spotted "" which is also the viruses' scientific name."
Smallpox;6;Only humans can get this disease.
Smallpox;7;Variola major kills between 20% and 40% of those who get it.
Smallpox;8;Variola minor kills only about 1%.
Smallpox;9;Many people who survive become blind because of the damage the virus does to the eyes.
Smallpox;10;During the first half of the 20th century, between 300 million and 500 million people died of this disease.
Smallpox;11;Even in 1967, about 15 million people caught the disease, and about two million people died of it, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Smallpox;12;The first vaccine for smallpox used the results of cowpox infections.
Smallpox;13;It was invented by Edward Jenner.
Smallpox;14;It was used to stop people from getting smallpox.
Smallpox;15;"The word "" vaccine "" came from "" vaccina "" , the Latin word for cow, because cowpox was used."
Smallpox;16;The WHO (World Health Organisation) said that they were trying to eradicate (completely destroy) smallpox in 1963.
Smallpox;17;They vaccinated people all over the world.
Smallpox;18;In 1980, the WHO said the disease no longer existed, and no one would ever get sick from it again.
Smallpox;19;However, live copies of smallpox are kept in different maximum-security laboratories around the world.
Smallpox;20;Some people believe that smallpox could be used as an agent for purposely infecting enemies in a war.
Smallpox;21;"Today, most people no longer receive a smallpox shot; but a few very, very old people still need it."
Smallpox;22;If somebody has smallpox, their entire body is covered in bumps infiltrated by blood that are worse than chicken pox.

Psychosis;1;Psychosis is the name used in psychiatry for a number of conditions.
Psychosis;2;People who suffer from psychosis are said to be psychotic.
Psychosis;3;Usually, psychotic people lose touch with reality, they have trouble telling what is real and what is not.
Psychosis;4;It is an extreme kind of altered state of consciousness.
Psychosis;5;The word psychosis has two parts.
Psychosis;6;The first part comes from psyche, which means soul in Ancient Greek.
Psychosis;7;The second part is the ending '-osis', which means illness or unnatural condition.
Psychosis;8;So literally, psychosis means unnatural condition of the soul.
Psychosis;9;People with psychosis may have hallucinations, which means they can experience things that are not really there.
Psychosis;10;They may also have delusions, which are fixed beliefs and ideas that are usually false.
Psychosis;11;Sometimes their personality changes, and they cannot think straight.
Psychosis;12;Some of these thoughts may be paranoid.
Psychosis;13;Not every psychotic person has all of these problems.
Psychosis;14;Because of these, psychotics often act in strange ways, which also makes it difficult for them to live a normal life as part of society.
Psychosis;15;They often have trouble with making friends, as most people do not understand them.
Psychosis;16;Psychosis can affect people to different levels.
Psychosis;17;Some people can continue with mostly normal lives, while other people will need medical help.
Psychosis;18;About 1 percent of people suffer from psychosis during their lives.
Psychosis;19;There are many things that can make someone seem psychotic.
Psychosis;20;These include poisons, drugs, diseases of the nervous system, and other illnesses.
Psychosis;21;For this reason, some people use the image of a fever of the central nervous system to talk about psychosis - a serious illness that may not have a very detailed explanation.
Psychosis;22;Many people have gone through unusual experiences that they believe are real.
Psychosis;23;Hallucinations connected to religion or paranormal experiences seem to be quite common.
Psychosis;24;Very often, these experiences cannot be called psychosis in a medical sense of the word.
Psychosis;25;For this reason, some people have said that psychosis may simply be an extreme case of something that is experienced by most.
Psychosis;26;People who have suffered from what could be called psychosis may simply have had experiences that were very strong or distressing.
Psychosis;27;In movies and the media in general, certain people who are shown as violent and antisocial are sometimes labelled psychotic.
Psychosis;28;This image of psychosis is wrong, the people shown are usually psychopaths or sociopaths, they usually do not have hallucinations or delusions.
Psychosis;29;Psychosis is most associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, drug addiction and brain damage but it can be caused by a wide range of conditions.
Psychosis;30;Psychosis is not a disease but rather a name for a number of symptoms, that can be caused by different diseases and conditions.
Psychosis;31;Very broadly speaking there are two types of causes for psychosis:   #In some cases, psychosis can be directly linked to a cause.
Psychosis;32;Some of the causes are:   #Damage to the brain, tumors.
Psychosis;33;"#Wrongly using (or abusing) certain drugs; for example amphetamines, cocaine or alcohol   #severe psychosocial stress   #Lack of sleep This is not a problem for most people, as they will only experience hallucinations shortly before going to sleep or shortly after waking up, which is considered normal."
Psychosis;34;#certain forms of epilepsy   #exposure to some traumatic event (violent death, terrorist activity, etc.)
Psychosis;35;#Certain drugs that are taken cannot simply be stopped from one day to the next, stopping them needs to be done in a certain way, usually assisted by a doctor.
Psychosis;36;If this is not done the right way, psychosis can result.
Psychosis;37;#Various mental illnesses (Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, clinical depression are among them)   #Different other diseases (syphilis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AIDS, malaria, and leprosy are among them)   #There are certain cases of people who suffer from psychosis, where no cause for the psychosis is clear.
Psychosis;38;In these cases, the causes are usually not known.
Psychosis;39;Current research suggests that some of these psychoses may be linked to genetic factors, or due to certain events during the pregnancy of the mother, or the early childhood of the person suffering from psychosis.
Psychosis;40;The first episode of psychosis may be triggered by stress.
Psychosis;41;Most psychoses can be treated, so that those suffering from them can lead a normal life.
Psychosis;42;The treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis.
Psychosis;43;In general, there are two different forms of treatment available:   There is a class of drugs called antipsychotics.
Psychosis;44;These usually work by changing the way the brain and nervous system react to neurotransmitters.
Psychosis;45;There is therapy for psychotic people.
Psychosis;46;This works by teaching them to recognise when they have an episode of psychosis, and to react to it in certain ways.
Cowpox;1;Cowpox is a disease.
Cowpox;2;This disease affects the skin.
Cowpox;3;It is caused by a virus (Cowpox virus) that is related to the Vaccinia virus.
Cowpox;4;People (or animals) who have the disease have red blisters.
Cowpox;5;The disease can be spread by touch from cows to humans.
Cowpox;6;The virus that causes cowpox was used to perform the first successful vaccination against another disease.
Cowpox;7;The disease vaccinated against was the deadly smallpox.
Cowpox;8;Smallpox is caused by the related variola virus.
Cowpox;9;"Therefore, the word "" vaccination "" has the Latin root vaca meaning cow."
Cowpox;10;In 1798, the English physician Edward Jenner made a curious observation.
Cowpox;11;Jenner lived in the countryside, not in the city.
Cowpox;12;Some of his patients had gotten cowpox, and recovered from it.
Cowpox;13;He observed that those patients did not get the disease again, they seemed to be immune against it.
Cowpox;14;What was more, they also seemed to be immune against smallpox.
Cowpox;15;Smallpox was a deadly disease then, that killed most of the people it infected.
Cowpox;16;So he used the fluid he got from cowpox lesions, and scratched it into healthy people.
Cowpox;17;That way, he could make those people immune against smallpox.
Cowpox;18;The Cowpox (Catpox) virus is found in Europe and mainly in the UK.
Cowpox;19;Human cases are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats.
Cowpox;20;"The virus is not commonly found in cows; the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles."
Cowpox;21;It is from these rodents that domestic cats get the virus.
Cowpox;22;Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face, neck, forelimbs, and paws, and less commonly upper respiratory tract infection.
Cowpox;23;Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized, pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction.
Cowpox;24;The incubation period (the time between an infection and the first signs of the disease) is 9–10 days.
Cowpox;25;The virus can be found mostly in late summer and autumn.
Cowpox;26;Cowpox was the original vaccine of sorts for smallpox.
Cowpox;27;After infection with the disease, the body (usually) gains the ability recognise the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and so is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently.
Cowpox;28;Later, and still today, another vaccine was used: vaccinia.
Cowpox;29;Vaccinia is similar to cowpox, but not the same.
Cowpox;30;Chickenpox   List of diseases
Chickenpox;1;Chickenpox, also known as chicken pox, is a disease.
Chickenpox;2;Usually, it is children who get the disease, but adults can also get it.
Chickenpox;3;People who have it get blisters or spots, mostly on the body and in the face.
Chickenpox;4;Those blisters are filled with a liquid.
Chickenpox;5;At some point, the blisters will drain, and the person will want to scratch them.
Chickenpox;6;Burst blisters usually become healthy without leaving scars, unless they become infected.
Chickenpox;7;The symptoms come in two or three waves, and they usually include fever.
Chickenpox;8;If there are no complications, the disease will last between three and five days in children.
Chickenpox;9;Chickenpox is very common and by the age 14, more than 90% of children will have had the disease.
Chickenpox;10;Getting chickenpox during a pregnancy is dangerous, as it can hurt both the mother and the child.
Chickenpox;11;Chickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family.
Chickenpox;12;People who had chickenpox in the past can also get a related disease called shingles later.
Chickenpox;13;Shingles are caused by the same virus but usually is only one part of the body.
Chickenpox;14;There is a vaccine against chickenpox.
Chickenpox;15;Usually, the vaccine is given to children if they did not have the disease before the start of puberty, that is aged 9–13 years old.
Chickenpox;16;Sometimes to help your child not to scratch when they have chicken pox, you can get a special cream for it such as e45.
Miscarriage;1;A miscarriage is the natural death of an embryo or fetus in the womb, before it is old enough to live on its own, outside the mother.
Miscarriage;2;The medical words for a miscarriage are spontaneous abortion.
Miscarriage;3;"( "" Spontaneous "" means something that a person did not expect to happen."
Miscarriage;4;"An "" abortion "" is when a pregnancy ends early, before birth.)"
Miscarriage;5;Among women who know they are pregnant, about 15-20% have miscarriages.
Miscarriage;6;(This means that up to 1 in every 5 women who know they are pregnant miscarries.)
Miscarriage;7;It is the most common complication (serious problem) that happens in early pregnancy in humans.
Miscarriage;8;In the United States, if a fetus dies after it is 20 weeks old, its death is no longer called a miscarriage.
Miscarriage;9;Its death is called a stillbirth, a fetal demise, or a fetal death.
Miscarriage;10;"( "" Demise "" means "" death. """
Miscarriage;11;)   But different countries have different ways of defining the difference between a miscarriage and a fetal death.
Miscarriage;12;For example:   In This Country:   Miscarriage Is:   Fetal Death Is:   Norway Death of a fetus under 16 weeks old Death of a fetus over 16 weeks old   Australia Death of a fetus under 20 weeks old Death of a fetus over 20 weeks old   United Kingdom Death of a fetus under 24 weeks old Death of a fetus over 24 weeks old   Italy Death of a fetus under 26 weeks old Death of a fetus over 26 weeks old   Spain Death of a fetus under 26 weeks old Death of a fetus over 26 weeks old   Nobody knows all of the reasons why a woman may miscarry.
Miscarriage;13;However, some common causes include:   Genetic problems, like aneuploidy   Problems with the mother's uterus or hormones   An infection somewhere in the mother's reproductive system   Tissue rejection (where the mother's body reacts to the fetus like it is something that does not belong in her body)   Serious physical trauma (injury, like a bad car accident   Very rarely, medical procedures that are used to diagnose problems with the fetus can cause miscarriage.
Miscarriage;14;This happens in only about 1% of cases (1 out of 100) when a woman has had chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis)   The most common causes of miscarriage change depending on what trimester the mother is in.
Miscarriage;15;(Each trimester lasts about three months.)
Miscarriage;16;Most miscarriages happen during the first trimester.
Miscarriage;17;Some studies say that two-thirds (two out of three) to three-quarters (three out of four) of all miscarriages happen during this trimester.
Miscarriage;18;About 30% to 40% (3 to 4 in every 10) of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.
Miscarriage;19;In more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, the embryo has chromosomes that are not normal.
Miscarriage;20;These chromosomal problems may happen because of problems as the embryo grows and its cells make copies of themselves.
Miscarriage;21;It is also possible for chromosomal problems to happen because of a problem with a parent's genes.
Miscarriage;22;However, this is more likely to happen in women who has had other miscarriages, or if one of the parents has a child or other relatives with birth defects.
Miscarriage;23;"Genetic problems are more likely to happen with older parents; this may be why miscarriages are more common in older women."
Miscarriage;24;Another cause may be the mother not having enough progesterone.
Miscarriage;25;If a woman is diagnosed with low progesterone levels in the second half of her menstrual cycle (the luteal phase), she may be prescribed progesterone, to take during the first trimester of her pregnancy.
Miscarriage;26;However, when a woman might already be miscarrying, there is no evidence that first-trimester progesterone pills decrease the risk of having a miscarriage.
Miscarriage;27;Scientists have even questioned whether problems with the luteal phase really can cause miscarriages.
Miscarriage;28;Common causes of miscarriage during the second trimester are:   Uterine malformation (when the mother's uterus is not shaped normally)   Growths in the mother's uterus (these are called fibroids)   Problems with the mother's cervix   These problems can also cause premature birth (when a baby is born earlier than expected).
Miscarriage;29;One study found that 19% of second trimester miscarriages were caused by problems with the umbilical cord.
Miscarriage;30;The fetus gets blood and oxygen through the umbilical cord.
Miscarriage;31;Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.
Miscarriage;32;If the baby cannot get enough oxygen because of a problem with the cord, it can die.
Miscarriage;33;Problems with the placenta may also cause second-trimester miscarriages.
Miscarriage;34;Nutrients and blood pass through the placenta in order to get from the mother to the umbilical cord.
Miscarriage;35;The placenta also helps filter out some things that could hurt the fetus.
Miscarriage;36;If there is a problem with the placenta, the fetus could die because it did not get enough nutrients and oxygen, or because the placenta did not filter out harmful things.
Miscarriage;37;Miscarriage is usually diagnosed when a pregnant woman notices that she is having certain symptoms and goes to see a doctor.
Miscarriage;38;The most common symptom of a coming miscarriage is bleeding during early pregnancy.
Miscarriage;39;The woman may not have any pain.
Miscarriage;40;Usually, if a pregnant woman is bleeding or having pain, an ultrasound should be done.
Miscarriage;41;The ultrasound can show that the fetus's heart is not beating, which means that the fetus has miscarried.
Miscarriage;42;If this happens, special tests should be done to make sure the woman does not have an ectopic pregnancy, which can kill a woman.
Miscarriage;43;Not all light bleeding during early pregnancy means a woman is having a miscarriage.
Miscarriage;44;But any woman having light bleeding during pregnancy should see her doctor.
Miscarriage;45;If the bleeding is heavy, the woman is having a lot of pain, or she has a fever, she should go to an Emergency Room or call an ambulance to take her to the hospital.
Miscarriage;46;"If a woman has bleeding during her pregnancy, she may be diagnosed with a "" threatened miscarriage. """
Miscarriage;47;In the past, if a doctor thought a pregnancy might miscarry in the future, they would suggest bed rest for the mother (lying in bed for most of the time).
Miscarriage;48;Today, most doctors and scientists think that bed rest does not help.
Miscarriage;49;There are a few different types of miscarriage:   In a complete miscarriage, the fetus has totally left the mother's body.
Miscarriage;50;So has the placenta.
Miscarriage;51;There are no pieces of fetal or placental tissue left in the uterus.
Miscarriage;52;In a missed miscarriage, the fetus has miscarried, but is still inside the mother's body.
Miscarriage;53;This often happens when the mother does not realize she had a miscarriage (which is common when the pregnancy is very early on).
Miscarriage;54;In an incomplete miscarriage, parts of the fetus or the placenta are still in the uterus.
Miscarriage;55;The treatment is different for each kind of miscarriage.
Miscarriage;56;If a woman has a complete miscarriage, she usually does not need any medical treatment.
Miscarriage;57;If a woman has an incomplete miscarriage or a missed miscarriage, there are three different choices for treatment:   Watchful Waiting means that a doctor will keep checking on the woman, but will not give any treatment unless a problem happens.
Miscarriage;58;With watchful waiting, most of these miscarriages will pass naturally in two to six weeks.
Miscarriage;59;This means that the tissue left in the woman will leave her body, through the vagina, without any treatment.
Miscarriage;60;With no treatment (watchful waiting), most of these cases (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.
Miscarriage;61;This path avoids the side effects and complications possible from medications and surgery, but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage.
Miscarriage;62;Medical Management means that medicine is given.
Miscarriage;63;Usually, a medicine called misoprostol is given.
Miscarriage;64;Misoprostol makes the uterus contract (get tighter) to push out whatever is inside.
Miscarriage;65;In about 95% of cases (95 out of 100), the fetal or placental tissue that is left in the uterus will leave the woman's body within a few days.
Miscarriage;66;Surgery is the fastest way to complete a miscarriage.
Miscarriage;67;It also makes bleeding less heavy and makes it not last as long.
Miscarriage;68;Also, the woman will not have to go through the physical pain of the miscarriage.
Miscarriage;69;Most often, one of two surgeries is used to complete the miscarriage:   :Vacuum aspiration, sometimes called dilation and evacuation (D & E).
Miscarriage;70;In a D & E, a tube attached to a pump sucks the tissue left in the uterus out through the cervix.
Miscarriage;71;:Dilation and curettage (D & C).
Miscarriage;72;"In a D & C, the cervix is widened, and the tissue left in the uterus is scraped and scooped out ( "" curettage "" )."
Miscarriage;73;Compared to giving medications, D & C has a higher risk of causing problems.
Miscarriage;74;For example, the cervix or uterus may be injured.
Miscarriage;75;Because of this, some women prefer not to have a D & C because they want to have children in the future and want to lower the chances of problems during future pregnancies.
Miscarriage;76;However, if a woman has had more than one miscarriage, D & C is the most convenient way to get tissue samples, which can be studied to see if a reason for the miscarriages can be found.
Miscarriage;77;The choice of which treatment to use depends on many things, including what the mother wants.
Miscarriage;78;However, there are guidelines that doctors use to suggest what treatment to use.
Miscarriage;79;Missed Miscarriage   The most important things that help doctors decide what to do are the age and size of the embryo, and the size of the gestational sac (the fluid around the embryo]].
Miscarriage;80;For embryos that were less than 7 weeks old, and the smallest gestational sacs, watchful waiting is the best choice, because the embryo will often leave the mother's body naturally.
Miscarriage;81;For embryos that were 7-9 weeks old with larger sizes and gestational sacs, medicine is suggested, but either watchful waiting or surgery might be used depending on the situation.
Miscarriage;82;For the embryos that were over 9 weeks old, with the largest gestational sacs, surgery is suggested because the mother is likely to have a lot of pain and bleeding when she miscarries.
Miscarriage;83;Incomplete Miscarriages   For an incomplete miscarriage, the size of the tissue left in the uterus is the most important thing that helps doctors decide what to do.
Miscarriage;84;Ultrasound is used to find out how large the tissue is.
Miscarriage;85;If the tissue left is smaller than 15mm (millimeters): Watchful waiting is usually the best choice, because it is likely that the tissue will leave the mother's body on its own.
Miscarriage;86;If the tissue is between 15 and 20mm: Medical or expectant management are suggested.
Miscarriage;87;Surgery is chosen only if there is a specific reason why the mother needs it.
Miscarriage;88;If the tissue is over 35 to 50mm, these things are suggested:   :Giving misoprostol to make the tissue left in the uterus leave the mother's body on its own more quickly.
Miscarriage;89;:Having the mother stay in the hospital to be watched for a few hours or overnight.
Miscarriage;90;She should stay until most of the tissue left in her uterus has passed, and she has stopped bleeding.
Miscarriage;91;:If misoprostol has not worked, surgery may be needed.
Miscarriage;92;A risk factor for miscarriage is something that makes a woman more likely to miscarry.
Miscarriage;93;There are many risk factors for miscarriage.
Miscarriage;94;For example:   The age of the mother.
Miscarriage;95;Women older than age 35 have a higher risk of miscarriage than younger women.
Miscarriage;96;At age 35, a woman has about a 20 percent risk.
Miscarriage;97;At age 40, the risk is about 40 percent.
Miscarriage;98;And at age 45, it's about 80 percent.
Miscarriage;99;Multiple pregnancies (pregnancies with more than one fetus, like twins and triplets).
Miscarriage;100;The more fetuses in the womb, the higher the risk.
Miscarriage;101;If the mother has certain diseases, like:   Diabetes, especially the mother needs insulin and her diabetes is still not controlled well.
Miscarriage;102;Hypothyroidism, especially when the hypothyroidism is very bad.
Miscarriage;103;Some infections, like HIV, rubella, malaria, and some sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
Miscarriage;104;If the mother or father smokes tobacco (cigarettes).
Miscarriage;105;If the mother drinks alcohol while she is pregnant, especially if she drinks often, or drinks a lot at once.
Miscarriage;106;The United Kingdom's National Health Service says that drinking alcohol becomes a risk factor if a mother drinks more than one glass of wine, more than one shot of whiskey, or more than two-thirds of a pint of beer a week.
Miscarriage;107;Most doctors say that no amount of alcohol during pregnancy is safe.
Miscarriage;108;If the mother uses illegal drugs, like cocaine, while she is pregnant.
Miscarriage;109;If the mother is injured, exposed to certain poisons, or is using an IUD when she gets pregnant.
Miscarriage;110;Problems with the mother's uterus or cervix.
Miscarriage;111;Some types of food poisoning.
Miscarriage;112;Congenital disabilities that can cause miscarriage   Ultrasound (used to diagnose miscarriage)   Dilation and curettage   Dilation and evacuation   Stillbirth
Malnutrition;1;Malnutrition is not getting necessary nutrition to be healthy.
Malnutrition;2;It is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations.
Malnutrition;3;Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little.
Malnutrition;4;Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet.
Malnutrition;5;This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet.
Malnutrition;6;Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well.
Malnutrition;7;They do not gain weight.
Malnutrition;8;Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones.
Malnutrition;9;They cry all the time with hunger.
Malnutrition;10;They are not active and have sunken eyes.
Malnutrition;11;Such children often fall sick.
Malnutrition;12;Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease.
Malnutrition;13;Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate.
Malnutrition;14;Famine   Hunger   Global Hunger Index   Starvation
Dysentery;1;Dysentery is a disease that involves severe diarrhea.
Dysentery;2;It is caused by a bacterium, which causes the intestines to swell up a lot.
Dysentery;3;The main symptom of dysentery is having blood in the excrement.
Dysentery;4;Some more symptoms are high fever and abdominal pain.
Dysentery;5;It is usually treated with antibiotics.
Dysentery;6;The diarrhea is severe and can be a problem for the people who catch the disease.
Domestic violence;1;Domestic violence means that in a relationship or marriage, one or both of the partners uses physical, sexual or psychological violence to try to get power or control over the other or due to losing their temper.
Domestic violence;2;Domestic violence can occur in heterosexual and same-sex relationships.
Domestic violence;3;There is often a predictable pattern or cycle of violence in a relationship and the abuse tends to get worse over time.
Domestic violence;4;Domestic violence can be also a factor to be homelessness, as pointed out by Principles 15 of the Yogyakarta Principles.
Domestic violence;5;In any culture or community, there are beliefs and attitudes that support domestic violence and beliefs and attitudes that do not support domestic violence.
Domestic violence;6;In most countries, laws exist to protect the victim of such violent acts.
Domestic violence;7;There are also organisations that can help in such situations.
Domestic violence;8;Domestic violence sometimes does not get reported to the police.
Domestic violence;9;Estimates say that only a third of domestic violence cases (or even less) get reported to the authorities.
Domestic violence;10;Many people who use violence against their partners have mental disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.
Domestic violence;11;Cycle of abuse (patterns in relationships where there is domestic violence)
Leprosy;1;Leprosy is an Contagious disease.
Leprosy;2;It has been known for a very long time.
Leprosy;3;Today, it is mostly called Hansen's disease, named after the person who discovered the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen.
Leprosy;4;It is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae.
Leprosy;5;A person with leprosy is called a leper.
Leprosy;6;As of 2004, the estimated number of new infections was about 400,000.
Leprosy;7;Getting the disease is hard, since it requires close contact with someone who has it, over a long period of time.
Leprosy;8;In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it.
Leprosy;9;Most cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries.
Leprosy;10;It has known to have been in the US before.
Leprosy;11;There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world.
Leprosy;12;This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria.
Leprosy;13;In former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed.
Leprosy;14;The symptoms of leprosy are irregular spots and patches on the skin.
Leprosy;15;These are either lighter colored than the surrounding skin, or reddish in color.
Leprosy;16;On those patches, hair will fall out, and they will feel numb to the patient.
Leprosy;17;Nerves will form knots there.
Leprosy;18;With the illness progressing the sense of touch will become less and less (until the patient feels completely numb).
Leprosy;19;So called leptomes and ulcers will eat away the skin, the flesh and the organs on the patches.
Leprosy;20;Usually people do not die of leprosy, but of secondary infections and diseases they get.
Leprosy;21;For many years there was a leprosy colony on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai called Kalaupapa.
Leprosy;22;Tens of thousands of people from the United States that had the disease were sent there.
Lung cancer;1;Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs.
Lung cancer;2;Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers when smoke gets in the lungs.
Lung cancer;3;Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year, more than any other cancer.
Lung cancer;4;It is currently the leading cause of cancer death in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women.
Lung cancer;5;The large majority of people who get lung cancer have smoked for many years.
Lung cancer;6;However, there are types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked.
Lung cancer;7;There are two main types of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung cancer;8;Small cell lung cancer typically responds well to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and non-small cell lung cancer is more commonly treated with surgical removal of the lung tumor.
Lung cancer;9;Non-small cell lung cancer   Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for about 85% to 90% of lung cancer cases.
Lung cancer;10;There are three types of non-small cell lung cancer:   Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma   Adenocarcinoma   Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma
Mental disorder;1;REDIRECTMental illness
Paraphilia;1;Paraphilia is a word used in sociology and medicine.
Paraphilia;2;Like many other medical terms it comes from Ancient Greek.
Paraphilia;3;It means that someone is sexually aroused by people (or by things) that are unable to return their affection.
Paraphilia;4;The word can also be used to refer to sexual practices which are bad for the mind or body and are mental disorder  s.   When doctors talk about paraphilia, they usually mean one of the following, among other things:   Dendrophilia - Sexual attraction to trees   Emetophilia - Sexual arousal from vomiting or watching others vomit   Exhibitionism- Wanting to expose oneself to strangers   Fetishism- Sexual arousal by non-sexual objects, like shoes or tongues   Frotteurism- Sexual arousal by rubbing against strangers   Infantilism - Wanting to be treated like an infant or a toddler   Incestophilia - Wanting to have sex with relatives   Klismaphilia - Sexual arousal from enemas   Masochism- Wanting to be hurt physically   Necrophilia - Sexual attraction to corpses   Pedophilia- Wanting to have sex with children   Sadism- Wanting to hurt people   Urolognia - Enjoying urinating on people, and/or having people urinate on him   Voyeurism- Sexual arousal by looking at strangers doing sexual things   Zoophilia - Feeling sexually attracted to animals   The respective behaviour is only classified as paraphilia if it is the only means for the person involved to get sexually aroused, for a considerable time.
Paraphilia;5;When normal people talk about paraphilia, they usually mean non-mainstream sexual behaviour.
Paraphilia;6;Homosexuality (LGBT) used to be considered a paraphilia, but this is no longer the case in a lot of countries.
Paraphilia;7;However, in a lot of other countries it is still considered abnormal.
Paraphilia;8;The opposite of paraphilia is normophilia.
Paraphilia;9;An example of a normophilia is teleiophilia.
Cystic fibrosis;1;Cystic fibrosis, also known as mucoviscidosis, CF, and 65 roses, is a condition a person may get from their parents.
Cystic fibrosis;2;It makes the body make thick, sticky mucus, which builds up in the lungs, the digestive system, and other parts of the body.
Cystic fibrosis;3;If both parents have the cystic fibrosis gene, and pass it into their child, the child will get cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis;4;A cystic fibrosis gene is needed from each parent.
Cystic fibrosis;5;The parent might not have cystic fibrosis but still might have the gene.
Cystic fibrosis;6;A person with cystic fibrosis is not contagious (they cannot give it to anyone else).
Cystic fibrosis;7;There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but there are a lot of medications that help keep people healthy.
Cystic fibrosis;8;Cystic fibrosis affects the entire body.
Cystic fibrosis;9;Overall the body has trouble moving salt to the parts of the body that need it.
Cystic fibrosis;10;Since the body has trouble moving salt, it piles up in places it is not supposed to like the lungs, stomach and intestines.
Cystic fibrosis;11;";Lungs   In the lungs when salt gets stuck it causes there to be less water which makes mucus to become very thick."
Cystic fibrosis;12;It becomes very hard to breathe.
Cystic fibrosis;13;The treatment for this is breathing medicine to help add water to the lungs to keep the mucus thinner so it is easier to cough up.
Cystic fibrosis;14;When there is thinner and less mucus it is easier to breathe.
Cystic fibrosis;15;There is no cure for cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis;16;Even though people can do things to stay healthy.
Cystic fibrosis;17;Healthy habits keep the person from getting more sick.
Cystic fibrosis;18;People can stay clean.
Cystic fibrosis;19;People can stay away from germs.
Cystic fibrosis;20;They can drink water to help the mucus go away.
Cystic fibrosis;21;Taking enzymes help digest food if there is mucus in the stomach.
Cystic fibrosis;22;Exercise clears mucus.
Cystic fibrosis;23;It builds strong muscles and bones and strengthens the lungs.
Cystic fibrosis;24;Taking vitamins helps the body fight off the infection.
Cystic fibrosis;25;It also helps the body grow and function well.
Cystic fibrosis;26;Inhaled antibiotics are used to keep bacteria from growing in the thick mucus.
Cystic fibrosis;27;Inhaled salt-water helps keep the lungs moisturized   Sweat chloride test - this tests the salt level of a persons sweat.
Cystic fibrosis;28;"Genetic test - this is used if the sweat test is positive to see if they have both genes.   """
Cystic fibrosis;29;"65 roses "" is how some children refer to their condition since cystic fibrosis is difficult for a young child to say."
Cystic fibrosis;30;'65 Roses' is also a trademarked phrase by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to help control its use.
Cystic fibrosis;31;It is a very helpful way for young children to understand.
Cystic fibrosis;32;When spoken aloud, it sounds similar to cystic fibrosis.
Myocardial infarction;1;An acute myocardial infarction, also called a heart attack, happens when a blood vessel in the heart suddenly becomes blocked.
Myocardial infarction;2;Blood vessels carry blood and oxygen.
Myocardial infarction;3;When a blood vessel in the heart gets blocked, blood cannot get to part of the heart.
Myocardial infarction;4;This part of the heart does not get enough oxygen.
Myocardial infarction;5;This is called ischemia.
Myocardial infarction;6;When the heart muscle becomes ischemic (does not get enough blood and oxygen), the ischemia often causes chest pain.
Myocardial infarction;7;This is called Angina Pectoris.
Myocardial infarction;8;If the ischemia lasts long enough, the heart muscle that is not getting enough oxygen dies.
Myocardial infarction;9;"This is called an infarction. """
Myocardial infarction;10;"Myocardial infarction "" means "" infarction (muscle death) in the heart muscle. """
Myocardial infarction;11;A heart attack is a medical emergency.
Myocardial infarction;12;The first few minutes are very important for keeping the person alive.
Myocardial infarction;13;Some of the damage from the heart attack can be repaired if the person gets treatment during the first hour of the attack.
Myocardial infarction;14;Most heart attacks are caused by Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).
Myocardial infarction;15;In coronary artery disease, a wax-like material called plaque builds up on the inside walls of arteries in the heart.
Myocardial infarction;16;This is called atherosclerosis.
Myocardial infarction;17;Plaque is made of cholesterol and other cells.
Myocardial infarction;18;The amount of plaque increases slowly.
Myocardial infarction;19;As more plaque builds up, the insides of the heart's blood vessels get narrower.
Myocardial infarction;20;This means that less blood can flow through the blood vessels.
Myocardial infarction;21;This can cause platelets (which make the blood clot) to build up in front of the plaque.
Myocardial infarction;22;This causes a blood clot in the blood vessel.
Myocardial infarction;23;If the clot breaks free and gets stuck in part of the blood vessel made narrower by the plaque, the plaque and the clot together block the blood vessel completely.
Myocardial infarction;24;This makes it impossible for blood to get to part of the heart, and causes a heart attack.
Myocardial infarction;25;A person can lower their chances of getting coronary artery disease by eating healthy foods, exercising, not smoking cigarettes, and not drinking too much alcohol.
Myocardial infarction;26;Signs that a person is having a heart attack show over several minutes, and rarely come immediately.
Myocardial infarction;27;Most people having a heart attack have chest pain.
Myocardial infarction;28;Sometimes, people also have pain in the left arm, the lower jaw, the neck, the right arm, the back, or in parts of the abdomen.
Myocardial infarction;29;Many women have different symptoms than men.
Myocardial infarction;30;The most common symptoms include shortness of breath (trouble breathing), weakness, and feeling very tired.
Myocardial infarction;31;Some women feel tired, do not sleep properly, and have shortness of breath for up to a month before they have a heart attack.
Myocardial infarction;32;Women may also have nausea and stomach upset when having a heart attack.
Myocardial infarction;33;"Sometimes, people have "" silent heart attacks. """
Myocardial infarction;34;These are heart attacks that do not cause any pain.
Myocardial infarction;35;They are more common in elderly people, women, and people with diabetes.
Myocardial infarction;36;In these people, suddenly feeling very tired, or fainting, may be the only sign of a heart attack.
Myocardial infarction;37;A heart attack is a medical emergency that needs treatment as quickly as possible.
Myocardial infarction;38;The most important thing is to save as much myocardium (heart muscle) as possible and prevent more complications.
Myocardial infarction;39;As time passes, the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases.
Myocardial infarction;40;Doctors or paramedics usually start certain treatments as soon as a heart attack is suspected.
Myocardial infarction;41;These treatments include:   Aspirin.
Myocardial infarction;42;Aspirin is an early and important treatment for a heart attack.
Myocardial infarction;43;Aspirin keeps platelets from sticking together, and can help prevent more blood clots from forming inside the blood vessels and the heart.
Myocardial infarction;44;Nitroglycerin (nitro).
Myocardial infarction;45;Nitro widens the blood vessels in the heart.
Myocardial infarction;46;This makes it easier for blood to flow through those vessels to the heart.
Myocardial infarction;47;Oxygen (if needed).
Myocardial infarction;48;If the patient is having trouble breathing, oxygen can be given.
Myocardial infarction;49;Pain medicine for chest pain (if needed).
Myocardial infarction;50;"Once doctors are sure that a person is having a heart attack, there are two main treatments: "" clot-busting medicines "" (thrombolytics) and percutaneous coronary intervention.   """
Myocardial infarction;51;"Clot-busting medicines "" (called thrombolytics) can dissolve blood clots that are blocking the blood vessels in the heart."
Myocardial infarction;52;This makes it possible for blood and oxygen to flow again to the part of the heart that was not getting enough blood and oxygen.
Myocardial infarction;53;The most common clot-busting medicine is called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
Myocardial infarction;54;Clot-busters work best if patients get them within 30 minutes after getting to the hospital.
Myocardial infarction;55;However, if a patient gets a clot-busting medicine within 12 hours after the heart attack starts, they have a better chance of surviving.
Myocardial infarction;56;Clot-busting medicines do have some risks.
Myocardial infarction;57;Sometimes they can thin the blood too much and cause bleeding.
Myocardial infarction;58;Percutaneous coronary intervention is a way of opening blocked coronary arteries.
Myocardial infarction;59;Percutaneous means that the procedure is not done by cutting a person open in surgery.
Myocardial infarction;60;"Coronary intervention means "" way to help the heart "" ."
Myocardial infarction;61;"Percutaneous coronary intervention is also called "" coronary angioplasty "" ."
Myocardial infarction;62;In a percutaneous coronary intervention, a doctor threads a flexible tube into one of the patient's blood vessels, usually one in the upper thigh.
Myocardial infarction;63;The doctor threads the tube up to the blocked blood vessels in the heart.
Myocardial infarction;64;On the end of the tube is a balloon.
Myocardial infarction;65;The doctor blows up the balloon, which pushes the plaque and blood clot against the side of the blocked blood vessel.
Myocardial infarction;66;This allows blood to flow through that blood vessel again.
Myocardial infarction;67;Sometimes, a doctor might also place a small mesh tube called a stent into the blood vessel.
Myocardial infarction;68;The stent will make sure the blood vessel stays open and does not get blocked again in the future.
Myocardial infarction;69;As soon as a person thinks they may be having signs of a heart attack, they should call emergency service right away.
Myocardial infarction;70;(Emergency services can be reached dialling 911 in the US, and 112 in most of continental Europe) However, the average person waits about three hours before asking for help.
Myocardial infarction;71;When a person waits to get help, they are more likely to have more serious damage to their heart.
Myocardial infarction;72;"The American Heart Association says "" time is muscle "" : the more time a person waits to get treatment, the more heart muscle dies."
Myocardial infarction;73;If a person is having trouble breathing, sitting straight up can help.
Myocardial infarction;74;The person should follow any instructions they get from the emergency operator or their doctor.
Sunburn;1;A sunburn is a kind of burn that happens when skin is exposed to sunlight for too long.
Sunburn;2;The ultraviolet part of sunlight breaks down natural chemicals in the skin.
Sunburn;3;This makes the skin become red.
Sunburn;4;A sunburn can be painful.
Sunburn;5;Sunburns stay for days or weeks.
Sunburn;6;People with lighter skin have more sunburns than people with darker skin.
Sunburn;7;This is because of a dark pigment called melanin that protects the skin.
Sunburn;8;There is more of it in dark-skinned people than in light-skinned people.
Sunburn;9;Eventually, if exposed to too much sunlight, skin cancer may develop.
Dehydration;1;Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something.
Dehydration;2;The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, hydor.
Dehydration;3;People get dehydrated when they lose more water than they take in.
Dehydration;4;The human body needs water to survive.
Dehydration;5;If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way.
Dehydration;6;Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death.
Dehydration;7;A person will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water the body is losing.
Dehydration;8;The most common causes of dehydration are:   Sweating a lot (because of hot weather or exercise)   Bad diarrhea   Vomiting (throwing up)   Urinating more than usual (this can happen if a person has uncontrolled diabetes or takes medicines like diuretics which cause them to urinate more often)   Fever   Anyone can get dehydrated.
Dehydration;9;However, some people are more at risk for dehydration.
Dehydration;10;(This means that they get dehydrated more easily than most people.)
Dehydration;11;Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration.
Dehydration;12;Dehydrated people may have different symptoms depending on how dehydrated they are.
Dehydration;13;If dehydration is not treated, it will get worse.
Dehydration;14;As dehydration gets worse, the symptoms get more dangerous.
Dehydration;15;"When people start to get dehydrated, they may have these symptoms:   Thirst   Dry, sticky mouth   Feeling tired or sleepy   Not urinating as much as usual   Dry skin   Headache   Constipation   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded   No tears come out when the person cries   When dehydration gets severe (very bad), its symptoms include:   Being very thirsty   Feeling irritable and confused (infants and children may be very fussy or get very sleepy)   Very dry mouth and mucous membranes   Shriveled, dry skin that is less elastic than normal (it    Urinating very little, with darkly colored urine, or not urinating at all   Sunken eyes   In infants, the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head) may be sunken   Low blood pressure (blood pressure may also drop when the person sits up or stands up, making them feel dizzy or faint; this is called orthostasis)   Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)   Fast breathing (tachypnea)   Fever   In the most serious cases, delirium or unconsciousness   Severe dehydration is a medical emergency."
Dehydration;16;If a person with severe dehydration does not get medical treatment soon enough, they can die.
Dehydration;17;Bad dehydration can cause serious health problems.
Dehydration;18;Some of these problems are:   Heat injury.
Dehydration;19;When it is very hot outside, or when a person is exercising a lot, fluids like water help keep the body cool.
Dehydration;20;If the person is dehydrated, their body can overheat (it gets too hot and cannot cool itself down).
Dehydration;21;This can cause heat injury.
Dehydration;22;The mildest (least serious) form of heat injury is heat cramps (cramping, or pain, in the muscles).
Dehydration;23;As heat injury gets worse, it becomes heat exhaustion.
Dehydration;24;If the body keeps overheating and the person does not get medical treatment, heat exhaustion becomes heat stroke.
Dehydration;25;Heat stroke is a very serious medical emergency.
Dehydration;26;People with heat stroke can have damage to their organs and even die if they do not get treatment quickly enough.
Dehydration;27;Swelling of the brain (cerebral edema).
Dehydration;28;Sometimes the body tries to fix dehydration by pulling a lot of water into its cells.
Dehydration;29;If the body pulls too much water into the cells, those cells can swell and break.
Dehydration;30;If this happens to the cells in the brain, the brain can swell.
Dehydration;32;When a person gets dehydrated, their electrolytes can get out of balance.
Dehydration;33;Electrolytes are important salts in the body which carry electricity.
Dehydration;34;When electrolytes like sodium and potassium get out of balance, the body's electrical signals can get mixed up.
Dehydration;35;This can cause seizures.
Dehydration;37;Fluid is an important part of human blood.
Dehydration;38;Water makes up most of blood plasma, which carries blood cells and other important things to the entire body.
Dehydration;39;If a person gets very dehydrated, the amount of blood in the body drops.
Dehydration;40;This causes low blood pressure.
Dehydration;41;If a person does not have enough blood and oxygen in their body, they can go into shock.
Dehydration;42;In medicine, this is called hypovolemic shock.
Dehydration;43;Kidney failure.
Dehydration;44;Bad dehydration can hurt the kidneys.
Dehydration;45;When the kidneys are hurt or not working properly, they cannot remove poisons and extra fluid from the blood.
Dehydration;46;To fix dehydration, a person has to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they have lost.
Dehydration;47;When dehydration is not too bad, people can usually treat themselves by drinking.
Dehydration;48;This is called oral rehydration therapy.
Dehydration;49;Stores sell special drinks like Pedialyte and Gatorade, which have both water and electrolytes in them.
Dehydration;50;People can also make their own oral rehydration solution (a drink which treats dehydration) by mixing water with sugar and salt.
Dehydration;51;People with very bad dehydration need emergency medical treatment.
Dehydration;52;They may need to get fluids intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein).
Dehydration;53;This replaces lost fluids and electrolytes much more quickly than drinking.
Dehydration;54;It is also helpful for people who are unable to drink because of nausea and vomiting from dehydration.
Down syndrome;1;"Down syndrome (or trisomy 21; old name mongoloid idiocy) is a genetic disorder."
Down syndrome;2;People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it.
Down syndrome;3;Down syndrome causes a mental handicap.
Down syndrome;4;It may be mild or severe.
Down syndrome;5;The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental age of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but it truly depends on the person.
Down syndrome;6;This can vary widely, but most individuals need supervision if they are to live their lives in a satisfactory way.
Down syndrome;7;Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things.
Down syndrome;8;The condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866.
Down syndrome;9;He called it mongoloid idiocy because he thought that children with Down syndrome had faces like that of Blumenbach's Mongolian race.
Down syndrome;10;Idiocy meant intellectual disability.
Down syndrome;11;"People do not use the term "" mongoloid idiocy "" today."
Down syndrome;12;It is a rude term.
Down syndrome;13;There is sometimes discrimination against people with Down syndrome, both in the education system and in society in general.
Down syndrome;14;Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead.
Down syndrome;15;People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people.
Down syndrome;16;A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties.
Down syndrome;17;Of every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome.
Down syndrome;18;Older women have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome.
Down syndrome;19;If they have a procedure known as amniocentesis, pregnant mothers can be told whether their foetus has Down syndrome.
Down syndrome;20;Sound scans may also diagnose the presence of Down Syndrome.
Down syndrome;21;Mothers whose foetus is diagnosed as having Downs syndrome may choose to have an abortion.
Down syndrome;22;In the United Kingdom and Europe 92% of such cases are aborted.
Down syndrome;23;They also grow differently from other children.
Down syndrome;24;Babies with down syndrome can be identified at birth because they may have a specific set of physical features.
Down syndrome;25;These features include narrow eyes, a flat nose-bridge, smaller mouths and shorter fingers.
Down syndrome;26;Smaller mouths can result in tongue protrusion or what looks like a large tongue.
Down syndrome;27;Sometimes the little fingers curve inwards as well, and there is also often a space between the big toe and the others.
Down syndrome;28;People with Down syndrome often have heart defects or Alzheimer's disease when they are older.
Down syndrome;29;About 90% of people with Down syndrome live through their teens.
Down syndrome;30;The lifespan of a person with Down syndrome averages between 50 and 55 years old.
Down syndrome;31;So far there have been no treatments for Down syndrome.
Down syndrome;32;Down syndrome comes from a problem with the genes.
Down syndrome;33;Humans are diploid organisms.
Down syndrome;34;This means that for each chromosome, there are two copies, one from the mother, and one from the father.
Down syndrome;35;During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes.
Down syndrome;36;People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it.
Down syndrome;37;There are three ways that Down syndrome is caused.
Down syndrome;38;The most common cause of Down syndrome is trisomy.
Down syndrome;39;Trisomy is when the child receives two chromosomes from the mother and one from the father.
Down syndrome;40;This makes it so there are three chromosomes of chromosome #21.
Down syndrome;41;Another way Down syndrome is caused is when new cells are made.
Down syndrome;42;Sometimes even when the parent cells are normal chromosome 21 can be deformed when cells reproduce.
Down syndrome;43;This makes it so some cells have 47 chromosomes and others have 46.
Down syndrome;44;This is called a mosaic disorder.
Down syndrome;45;Mosaic means that they have a third chromosome from the replication of cells.
Down syndrome;46;The third way Down syndrome can be caused is called translocation.
Down syndrome;47;This happens when a normal chromosome breaks into two pieces.
Down syndrome;48;This results in three chromosomes.

Genetic disorder;1;A genetic disorder is an illness caused by abnormalities in the genome.
Genetic disorder;2;They are heritable, and are passed down from the parents' genes.
Genetic disorder;3;If a genetic disorder is present from birth, it is a type of congenital defect.
Genetic disorder;4;Some only show up in later life.
Genetic disorder;5;Genetic disorders, like other illnesses, can cripple and kill.
Genetic disorder;6;Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions.
Genetic disorder;7;Sometimes they are relatively frequent in a population.
Genetic disorder;8;These types of recessive gene disorders give an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present.
Genetic disorder;9;Sickle cell anaemia is an example.
Genetic disorder;10;The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people.

Pneumonia;1;Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system.
Pneumonia;2;The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli.
Pneumonia;3;These help to take out oxygen from the air.
Pneumonia;4;In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed.
Pneumonia;5;They fill up with a fluid, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before.
Pneumonia;6;This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe.
Pneumonia;7;They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning.
Pneumonia;8;They may also feel pain when they breathe.
Pneumonia;9;Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine.
Pneumonia;10;Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.
Pneumonia;11;It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs.
Pneumonia;12;Other illnesses, like alcohol abuse or lung cancer, can also result in pneumonia.
Pneumonia;13;People with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing.
Pneumonia;14;They may also cough, or have pains in the chest area.
Pneumonia;15;The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused.
Pneumonia;16;If it was caused by bacteria, antibiotics can be used to treat it.
Pneumonia;17;People of all ages can have pneumonia.
Pneumonia;18;The disease is dangerous.
Pneumonia;19;Many people die from pneumonia, especially old people, or people with a weak immune system.
Pneumonia;20;According to some research in 2010, in some parts of the world where people are very poor like India, Nigeria, and Pakistan, pneumonia was the cause of death for more children under the age of five than any other disease.
Pneumonia;21;Statistically, however, for every 2,000 children in the developing world who die of pneumonia, only one child in the developed world dies from the disease.
Pneumonia;22;This is because of differences in health care and because of differences in rates of breastfeeding, not because of differences in children.
Pneumonia;23;Breastfeeding newborn babies greatly increases their ability to survive pneumonia, but some cultures think of breastfeeding as taboo.
Pneumonia;24;"; Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)   :SARS is a highly contagious and deadly type of pneumonia which first occurred in 2002 after initial outbreaks in China."
Pneumonia;25;SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a pathogen (disease-causing organism) that was not known until then.
Pneumonia;26;"New cases of SARS have not been seen since June 2003.   ; Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)   :BOOP is caused by inflammation (swelling or irritation) of the small airways of the lungs."
Pneumonia;27;It is also known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP).
Pneumonia;28;"; Eosinophilic pneumonia   :Eosinophilic pneumonia is invasion of the lung by eosinophils."
Pneumonia;29;Eosinophils are a particular kind of white blood cells.
Pneumonia;30;Eosinophilic pneumonia often occurs in response to infection with a parasite or after exposure to certain types of environmental factors.
Pneumonia;31;"; Chemical pneumonia   :Chemical pneumonia (usually called chemical pneumonitis) is caused by chemical toxins such as pesticides, which may enter the body by inhalation (breathing in) or by skin contact."
Pneumonia;32;When the toxic (poisonous or harmful) substance is an oil, the pneumonia may be called lipoid pneumonia.
Pneumonia;33;"; Aspiration pneumonia   :Aspiration pneumonia (or aspiration pneumonitis) is caused by accidentally inhaling oral (mouth) or gastric (stomach) contents into the lungs, either while eating, or after reflux or vomiting, and causing damage to the lungs."
Pneumonia;34;The lung inflammation from these materials is not an infection but it can eventually cause one, since the material taken into the lungs may contain bacteria.
Pneumonia;35;Aspiration is a common cause of death among hospital and nursing home patients, since they sometimes cannot cough hard enough to protect their airways.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome;1;Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was an atypical pneumonia.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;2;It started in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, in the city of Foshan, of the People's Republic of China.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;3;The disease was caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), a new coronavirus.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;4;It was also a part-time STD, it can be spread through both sexual and casual contact.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;5;SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;6;Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;7;"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;8;After the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak, the disease spread rapidly, reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003, and then to other countries via international travellers.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;9;The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;10;There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease, with 813 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.636%).
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;11;In May 2005 the disease itself was declared 'eradicated' by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label (the other was smallpox).
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;12;"The New York Times reported that "" not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;13;It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome;14;"Also, the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then. """
Syphilis;1;Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum.
Syphilis;2;Syphilis is usually spread by sexual contact.
Syphilis;3;However, a fetus can get syphilis from its mother while she is pregnant or during childbirth.
Syphilis;4;This is called congenital syphilis.
Syphilis;5;There are four stages of syphilis: the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages.
Syphilis;6;In each stage, the signs and symptoms of syphilis are different.
Syphilis;7;"In the primary stage, a person usually just has a wound on their skin, called a "" chancre. """
Syphilis;8;In the secondary stage, a person usually gets a rash.
Syphilis;9;"In the "" latent "" stage, syphilis has few or no symptoms."
Syphilis;10;If syphilis reaches the tertiary stage, which is the most severe, it causes many serious symptoms.
Syphilis;11;These can include problems with the nervous system (the brain and nerves) and problems with the heart.
Syphilis;12;Eventually, many people with tertiary syphilis will die if they do not get medical treatment.
Syphilis;13;Syphilis is usually diagnosed with blood tests.
Syphilis;14;The bacteria that causes syphilis can also be seen under a microscope.
Syphilis;15;Most people who have syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics.
Syphilis;16;By 1999, more than 12 million people around the world had gotten syphilis.
Syphilis;17;More than 90% of these people (10.8 million) lived in the developing world.
Syphilis;18;Syphilis got much less common after penicillin became available in the 1940s.
Syphilis;19;At that time, penicillin was used as a treatment for syphilis, and often cured the disease.
Syphilis;20;However, since 2000, syphilis is becoming more common again.
Syphilis;21;Syphilis can be a very dangerous disease if it is not treated.
Syphilis;22;Without treatment, 8% to 58% of people with syphilis die from the disease.
Syphilis;23;Syphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
Syphilis;24;After a person gets syphilis, the disease begins in the primary stage.
Syphilis;25;A person gets syphilis by having sex with a person who has syphilis.
Syphilis;26;Usually, the person who has syphilis has wounds on their genitals caused by syphilis.
Syphilis;27;Touching these wounds during sex (including oral sex or anal sex) can give a person syphilis.
Syphilis;28;Later, a chancre (skin sore) usually appears at the place on the body that touched the infected wounds.
Syphilis;29;The chancre can be painful.
Syphilis;30;The most common type of chancre gets bigger and bigger until it becomes an ulcer.
Syphilis;31;Chancres can appear in places other than the genitals.
Syphilis;32;In women, chancres most often appear on the cervix - the bottom of the uterus.
Syphilis;33;Some people get no chancres at all.
Syphilis;34;Many people who have secondary syphilis (40–85% of women and 20–65% of men) say they never had a chancre during the primary stage.
Syphilis;35;Around the place where syphilis entered the body, the lymph nodes usually get bigger about 7 to 10 days after the chancre forms.
Syphilis;36;If the person does not get treatment, their wound(s) can last for three to six weeks.
Syphilis;37;If a person does not get treatment, syphilis will get worse.
Syphilis;38;The secondary stage of syphilis will start about four to ten weeks after the person first got infected.
Syphilis;39;Secondary syphilis can cause many different symptoms.
Syphilis;40;However, the most common three symptoms are:   Sores on the mucous membranes (like the nose, throat, genitals, or anus)   A rash on the chest, back, hands, and/or feet   Swollen lymph nodes   All of the sores that people get during this stage can spread syphilis.
Syphilis;41;The bacteria lives inside the wounds.
Syphilis;42;The symptoms of secondary syphilis usually get better after three to six weeks.
Syphilis;43;However, in about 25% of cases (1 out of every 4), these symptoms can return.
Syphilis;44;In the latent stage of syphilis, a person has no symptoms, but blood tests show that he has syphilis.
Syphilis;45;Latent syphilis is described as either early or late.
Syphilis;46;"The early latent stage: In the United States, latent syphilis is called "" early "" if it has been less than one year since the person had secondary syphilis."
Syphilis;47;"In the United Kingdom, latent syphilis is called "" early "" if it has been less than two years."
Syphilis;48;In this stage, the symptoms of secondary syphilis can still come back.
Syphilis;49;The late latent stage: People enter this stage when it has been more than one year (in the U.S.) or more than two years (in the U.K.) since they had secondary syphilis.
Syphilis;50;People in this stage have no symptoms, and do not spread syphilis as easily as people in the early latent stage.
Syphilis;51;If a person with syphilis does not get treatment, the disease can reach the worst stage - tertiary syphilis.
Syphilis;52;Usually this happens about three to 15 years after the person first got infected.
Syphilis;53;Without treatment, one-third of people with syphilis get tertiary disease.
Syphilis;54;People with tertiary syphilis cannot infect other people with syphilis.
Syphilis;55;There are three different forms of tertiary syphilis.
Syphilis;56;Gummatous syphilis can happen anywhere from one to 46 years after the person first got syphilis.
Syphilis;57;On average, it happens after 15 years.
Syphilis;58;It causes soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation (swelling), of many different sizes.
Syphilis;59;Usually they appear on the skin, bone, and liver, but they can happen anywhere.
Syphilis;60;About 15% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get gummatous syphilis.
Syphilis;61;In neurosyphilis, the syphilis infects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).
Syphilis;62;In some people, neurosyphilis happens soon after they get syphilis.
Syphilis;63;(This is called early neurosyphilis.)
Syphilis;64;Some of these people have no symptoms of neurosyphilis.
Syphilis;65;Others get syphilitic meningitis, a dangerous infection of the meninges (the protective layers which line the brain and spinal cord).
Syphilis;66;Neurosyphilis can also appear later, usually four to 25 years after a person first got syphilis.
Syphilis;67;(This is called late neurosyphilis.)
Syphilis;68;Late neurosyphilis can cause many serious problems.
Syphilis;69;For example:   Meningovascular syphilis, which causes seizures   General Paresis: In this brain disease, syphilis causes chronic meningoencephalitis - an infection of both the meninges and the brain which does not go away.
Syphilis;70;This causes parts of the brain to die.
Syphilis;71;Because of this, the person gets dementia (which causes problems with the way a person thinks, remembers, acts, and behaves toward other people)   The person also gets tabes dorsalis (which causes problems with balance, and pain in the legs and feet)   About 6.5% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get late neurosyphilis.
Syphilis;72;This type of tertiary syphilis causes problems with the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood vessels).
Syphilis;73;It usually happens 10 to 30 years after the person first got infected with syphilis.
Syphilis;74;The most common problem it causes is syphilitic aortitis, which affects the aorta.
Syphilis;75;"The aorta is the most important artery in the heart; it helps carry blood to the entire body."
Syphilis;76;Syphilitic aortitis can make the aorta become too big.
Syphilis;77;If the aorta is too big, it cannot work correctly.
Syphilis;78;About 10% of people who do not get treated for syphilis get cardiovascular syphilis.
Syphilis;79;Congenital syphilis is spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy or childbirth.
Syphilis;80;Two out of every three infants born with syphilis have no symptoms.
Syphilis;81;In the other infants, symptoms can appear as the baby gets older.
Syphilis;82;The most common symptoms are:   Hepatosplenomegaly (where two important organs, the liver and spleen, are larger than usual)   Rash   Fever   Neurosyphilis   Swelling in the lungs   If babies with syphilis do not get treated, they can get late congenital syphilis, which has much more serious symptoms.
Syphilis;83;For example, the child can have seizures, and their body and brain may not grow normally.
Syphilis;84;Syphilis is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacterium.
Syphilis;85;Treponema pallidum is a species of bacterium which is shaped like a spiral: a spirochaete.
Syphilis;86;There are different types of Treponema pallidum bacteria, which are called subspecies.
Syphilis;87;Scientists think that Treponema pallidum can only live inside humans.
Syphilis;88;The bacterium cannot survive outside a human for more than a few days.
Syphilis;89;Syphilis is spread mostly by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus.
Syphilis;90;Syphilis can pass through undamaged mucous membranes, or through damaged skin.
Syphilis;91;Because of this, syphilis can be spread through oral sex, vaginal sex, and anal sex.
Syphilis;92;It can also be spread by kissing, if the person with syphilis has a sore in their mouth.
Syphilis;93;Only a very small amount of the Treponema pallidum bacterium needs to get into a person's body to cause syphilis.
Syphilis;94;However, not everybody who is exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease.
Syphilis;95;A person can get syphilis if they get a blood transfusion from someone with the disease.
Syphilis;96;However, many countries test blood donations for syphilis.
Syphilis;97;In countries that do not do this, getting syphilis from a blood transfusion is much more likely.
Syphilis;98;Scientists think syphilis is usually not spread by sharing needles (using the same needles to inject drugs).
Syphilis;99;"A person cannot get syphilis from sitting on a toilet seat; using a hot tub or a swimming pool; sharing plates, cups, or utensils; sharing clothing; or doing other regular daily activities."
Syphilis;100;It is hard for doctors to diagnose syphilis just from the signs and symptoms that happen early on, because many diseases can cause skin sores and rashes.
Syphilis;101;Instead, they can diagnose syphilis by doing a blood test, or by looking at the blood under a microscope.
Syphilis;102;Blood tests are used more often, because they are easier to do.
Syphilis;103;However, blood tests cannot tell which stage of syphilis a person has.
Syphilis;104;, there is no vaccine that prevents syphilis.
Syphilis;105;Not having sexual contact with a person who has syphilis is one of the best ways to prevent getting syphilis.
Syphilis;106;If a person does not know if their sexual partner has syphilis, having safer sex can help protect them.
Syphilis;107;For example, using a latex condom the right way lowers the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis.
Syphilis;108;However, even if a person uses a condom, it is still possible for him to get syphilis.
Syphilis;109;"Because of this, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the best ways to prevent syphilis are:   To be in a long-term relationship with a partner who does not have syphilis;   For both partners to be loyal in their relationship and not have sexual contact with anyone else; and   To avoid using alcohol or other drugs, because they make people more likely to have risky, unsafe sex, which can spread syphilis."
Syphilis;110;Congenital syphilis in newborn babies can be prevented by testing mothers for syphilis during early pregnancy and treating women who are infected.
Syphilis;111;By following these steps, in 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate the spread of syphilis from Cuban mothers to their babies.
Syphilis;112;The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the World Health Organization say that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis.
Syphilis;113;If a woman tests positive, her sexual partners (the people she has had sex with) should also be treated.
Syphilis;114;In most developed countries, congenital syphilis is not common.
Syphilis;115;It still happens once in a while, when women do not get any health care during pregnancy.
Syphilis;116;However, congenital syphilis is much more common in developing countries.
Syphilis;117;Many women in these countries do not get healthcare during pregnancy, and others get healthcare that does not include testing for syphilis.
Syphilis;118;When there are programs that make syphilis testing easier to get, fewer babies get congenital syphilis in these countries.
Syphilis;119;If people do certain things, they are more likely to get syphilis.
Syphilis;120;Medical professionals say that these people should get tested regularly.
Syphilis;121;For example, the CDC says that men who have sex with men should be tested at least every year.
Syphilis;122;Getting tested regularly helps prevent syphilis from being spread.
Syphilis;123;If a person is tested and finds out that they have syphilis, they are more likely to get treatment, and will not accidentally spread syphilis to other people.
Syphilis;124;Syphilis is a notifiable disease in many places, including Canada, the countries in the European Union, and the United States.
Syphilis;125;This means that if a healthcare provider (like a doctor or a nurse) knows that a patient has syphilis, the provider has to tell public health authorities that the patient is infected.
Syphilis;126;Public health workers then talk to all of the patient's sexual partners.
Syphilis;127;They tell them someone might have given them syphilis, without telling them who that person is.
Syphilis;128;Doctors might also try to get patients with syphilis to tell their sexual partners to get treatment.
Syphilis;129;Syphilis that is not complicated can usually be treated and cured by antibiotic medications.
Syphilis;130;Usually, people need just one dose of penicillin G or azithromycin.
Syphilis;131;If a person cannot take either of these medicines (for example, because they are allergic to them), some other medications work too.
Syphilis;132;"For example, Doxycycline and tetracycline are two other possible choices; however, they cannot be used in pregnant women."
Syphilis;133;The Treponema pallidum bacterium has become resistant to many different antibiotics, including macrolides, clindamycin, and rifampin.
Syphilis;134;This means that these antibiotics no longer kill the bacterium.
Syphilis;135;Once a person is in the later stages of syphilis, the disease is harder to treat.
Syphilis;136;For example, if a person has neurosyphilis, they need antibiotics that will kill the infection in their central nervous system (their brain and major nerves).
Syphilis;137;However, it is hard for penicillin G to get into the central nervous system.
Syphilis;138;Because of this, a single shot of penicillin - which will usually cure early syphilis - is not enough to cure neurosyphilis.
Syphilis;139;Instead, people with neurosyphilis usually need to be given large doses of penicillin for at least 10 days.
Syphilis;140;Usually, they also need to get the medicine intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein) so it goes more directly to the central nervous system.
Syphilis;141;If a person is allergic to penicillin, other antibiotics like ceftriaxone, doxycycline, or tetracycline can be used, but they have to be given over longer periods of time.
Syphilis;142;Once a person has late-stage syphilis, treatment will keep their syphilis from getting any worse.
Syphilis;143;However, if syphilis has already damaged the person's body, the treatment will not make that damage go away.
Syphilis;144;At best, treatment can only have a very small effect on the damage that has already happened.
Syphilis;145;Sometimes, the treatment for syphilis can cause a side effect called the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
Syphilis;146;This reaction usually starts within one hour after treatment begins, and lasts for 24 hours.
Syphilis;147;Its symptoms include fever, muscle pains, headache, and a fast heart rate.
Syphilis;148;Antibiotic medication breaks open syphilis bacteria to kill them.
Syphilis;149;As the bacteria break open, proteins come out of them.
Syphilis;150;These proteins cause the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.
Syphilis;151;By 1999, syphilis had infected about 12 million people.
Syphilis;152;More than 90% of these people lived in the developing world.
Syphilis;153;Syphilis causes problems in 700,000 to 1.6 million pregnancies every year.
Syphilis;154;Syphilis can cause a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage, a stillbirth, a premature baby, a baby with congenital syphilis, or a baby that dies before it is a month old.
Syphilis;155;In sub-Saharan Africa, syphilis causes up to 20% of perinatal deaths (deaths that happen soon after a baby is born).
Syphilis;156;Syphilis used to be very common, and it caused sickness and death all over the world.
Syphilis;157;It was especially very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.
Syphilis;158;During the early 20th century, syphilis quickly became less common in the developed world, because antibiotics were being used more and more.
Syphilis;159;Syphilis kept becoming less common until the 1980s and 1990s.
Syphilis;160;Since the year 2000, syphilis is getting more common again in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Europe, mostly among men who have sex with men.
Syphilis;161;"In China and Russia, syphilis has gotten more common among heterosexual ( "" straight "" ) people since the 1990s."
Syphilis;162;Studies say this is because of unsafe sexual practices, like having sex with many different people, prostitution (getting paid to have sex), and not having safer sex to protect against sexually transmitted diseases.
Syphilis;163;Over the 19th and 20th centuries, the symptoms of syphilis have become less severe (not quite as bad).
Syphilis;164;This is partly because there are more treatments that work well, and if they are given early, syphilis does not get as bad.
Syphilis;165;Also, the bacteria that causes syphilis has become weaker.
Syphilis;166;If people with syphilis get treated early on, they can usually be cured without the disease causing damage that cannot be fixed.
Syphilis;167;However, syphilis is still very dangerous.
Syphilis;168;It still causes serious problems, and sometimes death, if it is not treated.
Syphilis;169;Syphilis also makes a person two to five times more likely to get HIV.
Syphilis;170;Confection (having both syphilis and HIV) is common.
Syphilis;171;In some big cities, it happens in as many as 30% to 60% of people with syphilis.
Syphilis;172;Nobody knows exactly where and how syphilis started.
Syphilis;173;There are two major ideas about where the disease came from.
Syphilis;174;"The first idea is called the "" Columbian hypothesis. """
Syphilis;175;(A hypothesis is an educated guess about how something happened).
Syphilis;176;"This hypothesis says that when Christopher Columbus's crew came back to Europe after exploring the "" New World "" , they brought syphilis back to Europe and spread the disease there."
Syphilis;177;"The other idea is called the "" pre-Columbian hypothesis. """
Syphilis;178;"( "" Pre-Columbian "" means "" before Columbus. """
Syphilis;179;) This hypothesis says that syphilis was already in Europe before Columbus, and people just did not realize that the disease existed.
Syphilis;180;While there is evidence that can be used to say that either of these ideas are right, there is more evidence for the Columbian hypothesis.
Syphilis;181;The first written records that talk about an outbreak of syphilis in Europe are from 1494-1495.
Syphilis;182;The outbreak happened in Naples, Italy, when France was invading (trying to take over Italy).
Syphilis;183;"Because syphilis was spread by French soldiers who were coming back from Italy, at first it was called the "" French disease. """
Syphilis;184;"The name "" syphilis "" was first used in 1530 by an Italian doctor and poet named Girolamo Fracastoreo."
Syphilis;185;"He used the word "" syphilis "" as the title of a Latin poem that talked about the damage the disease was causing in Italy."
Syphilis;186;"At other times in history, syphilis was also called the "" Great Pox "" ."
Syphilis;187;In 1905, two men named Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann discovered that syphilis is caused by the Treponema pallidum bacteria.
Syphilis;188;Five years later, Paul Ehrlich created the first treatment that helped treat syphilis (called Salvarsan).
Syphilis;189;After that, scientists started to study penicillin.
Syphilis;190;In 1943, it was officially decided that penicillin worked for syphilis.
Syphilis;191;This was a major success in the treatment of syphilis.
Syphilis;192;Before penicillin, the treatments used for syphilis were often even worse than the disease.
Syphilis;193;For example, people were treated with mercury (which is poisonous and causes serious health problems), or people were just kept away from everyone else.
Syphilis;194;From 1932-1972, the United States Public Health Service did a study on syphilis in Alabama.
Syphilis;195;They wanted to see how syphilis got worse when it was not treated.
Syphilis;196;The researchers chose a group of poor African-American sharecroppers, but never told them they had syphilis.
Syphilis;197;Even after the 1940s, when the researchers knew penicillin could cure these people, they refused to let them get treatment or even tell them that penicillin could help them.
Syphilis;198;This study, now called the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, was very important in creating medical ethics.
Syphilis;199;Many famous people in history may have had syphilis.
Syphilis;200;For example, some people think that Franz Schubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, Édouard Manet, and Adolf Hitler had the disease.
Syphilis;201;Sexually transmitted disease   Treponema pallidum bacterium   Safer sex   Tuskegee syphilis experiment
Gonorrhea;1;Gonorrhea is a disease.
Gonorrhea;2;It is transmitted by having sex.
Gonorrhea;3;It is among the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases.
Gonorrhea;4;"Gonorrhea is also sometimes called "" the clap. """
Gonorrhea;5;Gonorrhea can be cured using antibiotics but the entire course of antibiotics must be used.
Gonorrhea;6;Its presence was found up to 700 years ago.
Gonorrhea;7;"At that time, this disease was described by coming from the "" Le Clapiers "" part of the city of Paris."
Gonorrhea;8;This part of the city was known to be where prostitutes lived.
Gonorrhea;9;It is caused by a bacterium, Neisseria gonorrheae.
Gonorrhea;10;Since it is caused by a bacterium, it can be treated with antibiotics.
Gonorrhea;11;The use of latex condoms when having sex can prevent it from spreading.
Gonorrhea;12;Sometimes antibiotics do not cure gonorrhea.
Gonorrhea;13;This is because the bacterium is becoming immune or resistant to the medicine.
Gonorrhea;14;When this happens, the infection is more difficult to cure.
Cardiac arrest;1;Cardiac arrest happens when the heart suddenly stops beating.
Cardiac arrest;2;This can be caused by a heart attack in which the heart's demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die.
Cardiac arrest;3;With cardiac arrest, normal circulation of blood stops, because of a failure of the heart to contract.
Cardiac arrest;4;This results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood, which causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation.
Cardiac arrest;5;Cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain) makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing, and this makes the heart stop completely.
Cardiac arrest;6;Unless the person is in hypothermia, brain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes.
Cardiac arrest;7;(In some cases, the person is put into hypothermia on purpose, to help the person recover better with less damage.)
Cardiac arrest;8;Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency.
Cardiac arrest;9;If it is treated early enough, some of the damage done can be reversed in certain groups of patients.
Cardiac arrest;10;When cardiac arrest leads to a person's death, this is called sudden cardiac death (SCD).
Cardiac arrest;11;First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available.
Pulmonary embolism;1;A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material (an embolus) that blocks blood from getting to the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism;2;It is usually caused by a blood clot that starts somewhere else in the body and travels to the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism;3;However, it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, or bone.
Pulmonary embolism;4;Rarely, while giving birth, a woman can get a clot of amniotic fluid.
Pulmonary embolism;5;Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism start suddenly, as soon as the clot starts blocking blood flow to the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism;6;Blood is supposed to pick up oxygen in the lungs and then carry that oxygen to the rest of the body.
Pulmonary embolism;7;If blood cannot get through to the lungs, it cannot pick up oxygen or deliver it to the body.
Pulmonary embolism;8;Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.
Pulmonary embolism;9;Often, the first sign of a pulmonary embolism is syncope (fainting), because the brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen.
Pulmonary embolism;10;Other symptoms include:   Chest pain that feels like a knife sticking into the chest.
Pulmonary embolism;11;The pain is often worse when the person breathes in.
Pulmonary embolism;12;Trouble breathing   Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)   Low oxygen saturation (because the body is not getting enough oxygen)   The worst kind of pulmonary embolism is caused by a saddle embolus.
Pulmonary embolism;13;This kind of embolus blocks the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism;14;This makes it impossible for any blood to get through to the lungs.
Pulmonary embolism;15;Since no blood can get out to the rest of the body, the person's blood pressure drops and they can go into shock.
Pulmonary embolism;16;A saddle embolus is a very serious medical emergency.
Pulmonary embolism;17;Many people with this type of embolus die.
Pulmonary embolism;18;There are many risk factors that make it more likely for a person to get a pulmonary embolism.
Pulmonary embolism;19;"For example:   Smoking   A type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation ( "" A-fib "" )   Recent surgery (after surgery, the body's blood clotting system works harder than usual, to help heal the body."
Pulmonary embolism;20;"If clots travel to the lungs, they can cause a pulmonary embolism)   Being paralyzed, bedridden, or not able to move around very much   Sitting in one place for a long time, like on a long airplane flight (this makes the blood pool in the legs; if a blood clot forms in the leg, it can travel through the blood vessels to the lungs)   Recent fracture of one of the long bones in the leg (because having a broken leg makes it harder to move around; also, clots of fat from the bone marrow can escape from the broken bone and travel to the lungs)   High levels of estrogen because of pregnancy or some birth control pills   Having had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - a blood clot in a large vein - before   Certain kinds of cancer (some kinds can cause extra blood clotting)   Being overweight or obese   There are a few treatments for pulmonary embolism."
Pulmonary embolism;21;The choice of which treatments to use depends on how serious the pulmonary embolism is.
Pulmonary embolism;22;Treatments include:   Oxygen.
Pulmonary embolism;23;Oxygen can be given through a special mask to make it easier for the person's body to get the oxygen it needs.
Pulmonary embolism;25;"These are medicines commonly called "" blood thinners. """
Pulmonary embolism;26;Doctors may give a few blood thinners together.
Pulmonary embolism;27;For example, they may give heparin because it works right away.
Pulmonary embolism;28;They may also give warfarin (Coumadin), which takes a few days to start working, but which the patient can keep taking at home.
Pulmonary embolism;30;"These are medicines often called "" clot busters "" or "" clot dissolvers. """
Pulmonary embolism;31;They can quickly dissolve (break up) a clot.
Pulmonary embolism;32;However, they are usually given only if a pulmonary embolism is life-threatening, because they can cause bleeding.
Pulmonary embolism;33;Removing the clot.
Pulmonary embolism;34;Sometimes a doctor will thread a catheter (a flexible tube) up through a vein and into the lung.
Pulmonary embolism;35;Once the doctor finds the clot, the catheter can be used to pull the clot out, or to give medicine to dissolve the clot.
Pulmonary embolism;36;In very bad cases, surgery may be needed to remove a clot.
Psittacosis;1;Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that can be caught from birds such as parrots, pigeons, and parakeets.
Psittacosis;2;The disease is not common, with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year.
Psittacosis;3;Psittacosis usually gives flu-like symptoms, such as fevers, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and a dry cough.
Psittacosis;4;The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x-ray.
Psittacosis;5;In rare cases, Psittacosis can cause endocarditis - swelling of joints, and swelling of the cornea.
Psittacosis;6;Psittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics, especially with Tetracycline.
Psittacosis;7;The disease rarely kills people, with only 1% of those who get the disease dying.
Rubella;1;Rubella (also known as German measles) is a disease caused by the Rubella virus.
Rubella;2;It is often mild and an attack can pass unnoticed.
Rubella;3;However, this can make the virus very difficult to diagnose.
Rubella;4;The disease can last 1–5 days.
Rubella;5;Children recover more quickly than adults.
Rubella;6;The virus usually enters the body through the nose or throat.
Rubella;7;Like most viruses living along the respiratory tract, it is passed from person to person by tiny droplets in the air that are breathed out.
Rubella;8;Rubella can also be transmitted from a mother to her developing baby (fetus) through the placenta.
Rubella;9;This can be very dangerous to the fetus, especially if the mother gets rubella early on in her pregnancy.
Rubella;10;Rubella can cause deafness, heart problems, intellectual disability, and many other problems in developing fetuses.
Rubella;11;The virus has an incubation period of 2 to 3 weeks during which it becomes established.
Rubella;12;Common symptoms are a red/pink rash, swollen lymph nodes, and a high fever.
Rubella;13;The disease is named German measles because it has a similar red rash to measles and was first described in detail by German doctors.
Rubella;14;On April 29, 2015, it was announced that rubella has been eliminated in North American and South America.
Rubella;15;A scientific group of experts said it took 15 years of work for this to happen.
Rubella;16;Among the groups are: Pan American Health Organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF, and the United Nations Foundation.
Anaphylaxis;1;Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction.
Anaphylaxis;2;It begins suddenly and may cause death.
Anaphylaxis;3;Anaphylaxis has many symptoms, such as an itchy rash, throat swelling, breathing problems, and low blood pressure.
Anaphylaxis;4;Common causes include insect bites, foods, and medications.
Anaphylaxis;5;Anaphylaxis happens when a person eats, breathes in, or is injected with an allergen (something they are allergic to).
Anaphylaxis;6;Their immune system over-reacts.
Anaphylaxis;7;It sends out special proteins from inside certain white blood cells.
Anaphylaxis;8;These proteins can start an allergic reaction or make the reaction worse.
Anaphylaxis;9;Anaphylaxis is diagnosed from a person’s signs and symptoms.
Anaphylaxis;10;The best treatment is an injection (a shot) of epinephrine (adrenaline).
Anaphylaxis;11;Sometimes doctors give other medicines along with epinephrine.
Anaphylaxis;12;Worldwide, about 0.05–2% of people have anaphylaxis at some point in their lives.
Anaphylaxis;13;Anaphylaxis appears to be getting more common.
Anaphylaxis;14;Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported since ancient times.
Anaphylaxis;15;"The condition was originally named "" aphylaxis "" by Charles Richet in 1902."
Anaphylaxis;16;In 1913, Richet was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his work on anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;17;"Later, the name was changed to "" anaphylaxis "" because it sounded nicer."
Anaphylaxis;18;"The word "" anaphylaxis "" comes from the Greek words ἀνά (ana), against, and φύλαξις (phyla's), protection."
Anaphylaxis;19;Anaphylaxis can cause many different signs and symptoms over minutes or hours.
Anaphylaxis;20;If the anaphylaxis is caused by something that entered the body directly through the bloodstream (through a vein), symptoms appear within an average of 5 to 30 minutes.
Anaphylaxis;21;If it is caused by a food the person ate, symptoms appear within an average of 2 hours.
Anaphylaxis;22;The most common body systems affected by anaphylaxis include:   Skin (affected in 80–90% of cases)   Lungs and breathing pathways (70%)   Stomach and intestines (30–45%)   Heart and blood vessels (10–45%)   Central nervous system (10–15%)   People with anaphylaxis usually have problems with two or more of these body systems.
Anaphylaxis;23;Skin symptoms usually include:   Hives (raised, itchy bumps on the skin)   Itchiness   Flushing (a red face or skin)   Swollen lips   Runny nose   Swelling of the mucous membrane on the surface of the eye and eyelid (conjunctiva)   Angioedema (swelling under the skin).
Anaphylaxis;24;People with angioedema may feel like their skin is burning instead of itching.
Anaphylaxis;25;In 20% of cases, the tongue or throat may swell up, which can cause breathing problems.
Anaphylaxis;26;If a person is having breathing problems, the skin may turn blue because the body is not getting enough oxygen.
Anaphylaxis;27;This is called cyanosis.
Anaphylaxis;28;"Respiratory signs and symptoms include:   Trouble breathing (also called dyspnea or shortness of breath)   Bronchoconstriction (when the bronchi, the tubes that bring air to the lungs, get narrower; this makes it harder for air to get to the lungs)   , pain with swallowing, or a cough   When a medical professional listens to the patient's lungs with a stethoscope, they may hear:   Low-pitched sounds called wheezes, caused by bronchoconstriction   High-pitched sounds called stridor, caused by swelling in the upper airway   When a person has anaphylaxis, some of the cells in the heart may release histamine."
Anaphylaxis;29;"This can cause the heart’s blood vessels to get narrower suddenly (this is called "" coronary artery spasm "" )."
Anaphylaxis;30;If the heart's blood vessels get too narrow, the heart cannot get enough blood.
Anaphylaxis;31;This can cause many serious problems:   Heart cells can die.
Anaphylaxis;32;This is called a myocardial infarction, or a heart attack   The heart may beat too slowly or too quickly (these are called cardiac arrhythmias)   The heart may stop beating altogether.
Anaphylaxis;33;This is called cardiac arrest.
Anaphylaxis;34;Anaphylaxis can also cause low blood pressure.
Anaphylaxis;35;This may be caused by distributive shock, where the body's blood vessels get much wider because of the chemicals released by the immune system.
Anaphylaxis;36;It can also be caused by cardiogenic shock, where the heart is not getting enough blood to pump out to the rest of the body.
Anaphylaxis;37;Low blood pressure can cause many problems, including:   A fast heart rate   A slow heart rate.
Anaphylaxis;38;This is not very common.
Anaphylaxis;39;It happens in about 10% of cases.
Anaphylaxis;40;It is called the Bezold-Jarisch reflex   Syncope (fainting)   In rare cases, very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;41;People who already have heart disease are at greater risk of having heart problems from anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;42;Anaphylaxis can also cause problems with other body systems:   Stomach and intestines: A person may have abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting (throwing up)   Urinary and genital systems: Women may have pain in the pelvis that feels like cramps in the uterus.
Anaphylaxis;43;Men and women may lose control of their bladder.
Anaphylaxis;44;Central nervous system: A person may have confused thoughts.
Anaphylaxis;45;They may have headaches caused by blood vessels in the brain getting wider.
Anaphylaxis;46;They may feel anxious (very worried) and believe they are going to die.
Anaphylaxis;47;Anaphylaxis can be caused by the body’s response to almost any foreign substance (anything that is outside the body).
Anaphylaxis;48;"Common causes include venom from insect bites or stings; foods; and medications."
Anaphylaxis;49;In children and young adults, foods are the most common trigger (or cause) of anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;50;In older adults, medications and insect bites or stings are more common triggers.
Anaphylaxis;51;Many foods can trigger anaphylaxis, even when the food is eaten for the first time.
Anaphylaxis;52;In the Western world, the most common causes are eating or touching peanuts, wheat, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs.
Anaphylaxis;53;In the Middle East, sesame is a common trigger food.
Anaphylaxis;54;In Asia, rice and chickpeas often cause anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;55;Severe cases of anaphylaxis usually happen when a person eats the trigger food.
Anaphylaxis;56;However, some people have severe anaphylaxis when the trigger food touches some part of their body.
Anaphylaxis;57;Children can outgrow their allergies.
Anaphylaxis;58;For example, by age 16:   80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs can eat these foods with no problems   20% of children who had only one case of anaphylaxis to peanuts can eat peanuts with no problems   Any medication may cause anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;59;The most common are β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin), then aspirin and NSAIDs.
Anaphylaxis;60;Venom from stinging or biting insects, like bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) or kissing bugs (Triatominae), may cause anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;61;If a person has a bad allergic reaction to venom once, they have a greater risk of having anaphylaxis if they are stung or bitten again.
Anaphylaxis;62;However, half of the people who die of anaphylaxis have had no anaphylactic reaction before.
Anaphylaxis;63;Certain diseases, called atopic diseases, can make a person more likely to have allergies.
Anaphylaxis;64;Atopic diseases include asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis.
Anaphylaxis;65;People with these diseases have a high risk of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and radiocontrast agents.
Anaphylaxis;66;However, these people do not have a higher risk from injected medications or stings.
Anaphylaxis;67;One study of children with anaphylaxis found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases.
Anaphylaxis;68;More than 90% of children who die from anaphylaxis have asthma.
Anaphylaxis;69;The risk of having another anaphylactic reaction decreases as a person avoids the trigger for longer and longer.
Anaphylaxis;70;Anaphylaxis usually happens because the immune system over-reacts to an allergen.
Anaphylaxis;71;The immune system releases mast cells and basophils, which are types of white blood cells.
Anaphylaxis;72;The immune system sees the trigger as something bad and sends out white blood cells to kill it.
Anaphylaxis;73;The mast cells and basophils attach to the allergen to try to kill it.
Anaphylaxis;74;However, because the system is over-reacting, the mast cells and basophils explode and dump out chemicals that cause inflammation, like histamine.
Anaphylaxis;75;Histamine causes many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;76;For example:   Bronchoconstriction (where the tubes that carry air to the lungs get narrower)   Vasodilation (where the blood vessels get wider)   Fluid leaks out of blood vessels   The heart muscle does not work as well   Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on signs, symptoms, and knowing that a person has been exposed to an allergen.
Anaphylaxis;77;It is very likely that a person has anaphylaxis if any of these three things happen within minutes or hours after they were exposed to an allergen:   Problems with the skin or mucosal tissue, plus either breathing problems or a low blood pressure   Two or more of these symptoms:   #Problems with the skin or mucosa   #Breathing problems   #Low blood pressure   #Gastrointestinal symptoms   Low blood pressure after exposure to an allergen   If a person has a bad reaction to an insect sting or a medication, blood tests for tryptase or histamine might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;78;However, these tests are not very useful if the cause is food, or if the person has a normal blood pressure.
Anaphylaxis;79;Also, these tests cannot say for sure that a person does not have anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;80;Allergy testing may help to identify what caused a person’s anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;81;Skin allergy tests (such as patch tests) can be done for certain foods and venoms.
Anaphylaxis;82;Skin tests can diagnose an allergy to penicillin, but there are no skin tests for other medications.
Anaphylaxis;83;Blood tests can diagnose milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and fish allergies.
Anaphylaxis;84;"Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between anaphylaxis; asthma; fainting caused by not having enough oxygen; and panic attacks."
Anaphylaxis;85;However, there are some important differences between these conditions:   People with asthma usually do not have itching, swelling, or problems with their stomach or intestines.
Anaphylaxis;86;After fainting, a person's skin is pale, and they will not have a rash or swelling.
Anaphylaxis;87;Their breath sounds will be normal.
Anaphylaxis;88;A person who is having a panic attack may have flushed skin, but will not have hives or swelling.
Anaphylaxis;89;Usually their blood pressure will not be low.
Anaphylaxis;90;Their breath sounds will be normal.
Anaphylaxis;91;The best way to prevent anaphylaxis is to avoid the trigger that caused anaphylaxis in the past.
Anaphylaxis;92;When this is not possible, there may be treatments to make the body stop reacting to the trigger.
Anaphylaxis;93;This is called desensitization.
Anaphylaxis;94;For example, treatment of the immune system (immunotherapy) with Hymenoptera venoms is able to make 80–90% of adults and 98% of children stop having allergic reactions to bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and fire ants.
Anaphylaxis;95;Most people who are allergic to certain medicines can just avoid those medicines.
Anaphylaxis;96;However, desensitization is possible for many medications (for example, many chemotherapies) if the person has to take those medicines.
Anaphylaxis;97;"People with latex allergies may have to avoid "" cross-reactive foods. """
Anaphylaxis;98;These are foods that have ingredients that are similar to latex.
Anaphylaxis;99;Examples of these foods includeavocados, bananas, and potatoes.
Anaphylaxis;100;Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require emergency medical treatment.
Anaphylaxis;101;Some patients need help keeping their airways open so they can breathe in air.
Anaphylaxis;102;Other patients need to be given extra oxygen or large amounts of intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle into a vein).
Anaphylaxis;103;Epinephrine is the best treatment for anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;104;Doctors often give antihistamines (which destroy histamine) and steroids along with epinephrine.
Anaphylaxis;105;Once a person has returned to normal, they should be watched in the hospital for 2 to 24 hours to make sure their symptoms do not return.
Anaphylaxis;106;Epinephrine is the best and first treatment used for anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;107;It reverses many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;108;"For example, it makes the bronchi (the passages to the lungs) get wider; it makes the blood vessels go back to their normal size; and it raises blood pressure."
Anaphylaxis;109;"Epinephrine comes in an "" auto-injector, "" usually called an "" EpiPen. """
Anaphylaxis;110;Once its safety cap is taken off, the EpiPen just has to be pressed into the thigh, and the right amount of epinephrine will automatically be injected into the person's body.
Anaphylaxis;111;Doctors can prescribe EpiPens to people who know they have allergies, so they can treat themselves for anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;112;Many ambulances also carry EpiPens to treat anaphylaxis.
Anaphylaxis;113;The EpiPen is meant to be injected into the thigh muscle, on the outside of the leg, as soon as anaphylaxis is suspected.
Anaphylaxis;114;There is no reason why it should not be used if a person is having an anaphylactic reaction.
Anaphylaxis;115;The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if the person is still having breathing problems or other major symptoms.
Anaphylaxis;116;A second dose is needed in 16 to 35% of cases.
Anaphylaxis;117;More than two doses are rarely needed.
Anaphylaxis;118;Epinephrine can cause minor side effects, including tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.
Anaphylaxis;119;Epinephrine may not work in people who are taking β-blockers.
Anaphylaxis;120;In these people, if epinephrine does not work, doctors can give intravenous glucagon.
Anaphylaxis;121;"People who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to have an "" allergy action plan. """
Anaphylaxis;122;These plans often include:   Parents telling schools about their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency   Knowing how and when to use EpiPens   Wearing a medical alert bracelet that says what the person is allergic to   Planning for how to avoid triggers   If anaphylaxis is diagnosed and the person is treated quickly, there is a good chance that they will recover.
Anaphylaxis;123;Even if nobody knows what caused the anaphylaxis, the person usually makes a good recovery as long as they get medication to stop the reaction.
Anaphylaxis;124;When people die from anaphylaxis, they usually die from respiratory (breathing) problems, usually the airway closing up, or cardiovascular problems, like shock.
Anaphylaxis;125;About 0.7% to 20% of people with anaphylaxis die from it.
Anaphylaxis;126;Some people die within minutes.
Anaphylaxis;127;Very rarely, people have exercise-induced anaphylaxis - anaphylaxis that is caused by exercise.
Anaphylaxis;128;These people usually do well.
Anaphylaxis;129;They usually have fewer anaphylactic episodes, which are less severe, as they get older.
Hypertension;1;Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is higher than it should be.
Hypertension;2;This requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels.
Hypertension;3;The pressure in the arteries changes depending on what the heart is doing.
Hypertension;4;When the heart squeezes, pumping blood into the arteries, the pressure increases.
Hypertension;5;When the heart relaxes, the pressure decreases.
Hypertension;6;When blood pressure is measured, the highest pressure (when the heart is squeezing) is called the systolic blood pressure.
Hypertension;7;The lowest pressure (when the heart is relaxing) is called the diastolic blood pressure.
Hypertension;8;Blood pressure is written as two numbers.
Hypertension;9;For example, in the picture at the right, the person's systolic blood pressure was 158.
Hypertension;10;Their diastolic blood pressure was 99.
Hypertension;11;This blood pressure is written as 158/99.
Hypertension;12;"It is said "" 158 over 99. """
Hypertension;13;There are two types of hypertension, called “primary” and “secondary.” Primary hypertension means that the hypertension is not caused by any other disease or condition and it gradually develops over time with age.
Hypertension;14;Secondary hypertension means that the hypertension is caused by another disease or conditions.
Hypertension;15;Secondary hypertension tend to result in higher blood pressure than primary hypertension.
Hypertension;16;In most cases (90-95%), hypertension is primary.
Hypertension;17;Only a small amount of hypertension (5-10%) is secondary.
Hypertension;18;There are various health conditions that leads to secondary hypertension which includes: Obstructive sleep apnea, Kidney problems, Adrenal gland tumors, Thyroid problems, Certain defects you're born with (congenital) in blood vessels, Certain medications (birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs), Illegal drugs (cocaine and amphetamines).
Hypertension;19;Hypertension can cause many problems, including heart attack, stroke, Aneurysm, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, vision loss, Metabolic syndrome, Dementia, etc..   To stay healthy, most people should try to keep their blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg.
Hypertension;20;The risk factors includes age, Race, Family history or genes, obesity, lack of physical activity, chewing or smoking tobacco, too much salt in diet, not enough potassium in diet, alcohol, stress, kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.
Hypertension;21;Hypertension can often be fixed with changes in diet or lifestyle.
Hypertension;22;The 2004 British Hypertension Society suggests that people with high blood pressure:   Lose weight if they are overweight or obese   Exercise regularly   Decrease the amount of salt they eat   Limit the amount of alcohol they drink   Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables   If lifestyle changes do not decrease a person's blood pressure, then the person may need medications.
Hypertension;23;A doctor will choose which medications to use, based on what other medical problems the person has.
Hypertension;24;Examples of medications that decrease blood pressure include:   Diuretics, which increase urination to get rid of extra fluid   Beta blockers, which slow down the heart rate   ACE inhibitors, which relax the arteries   Even small decreases in blood pressure can have a large effect on a person's health.
Hypertension;25;For example, decreasing blood pressure by 5 mmHg (for example, from 150/100 to 145/95 mmHg) can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%.
Hypertension;26;It can also decrease the risk of heart disease by 21%.

Cataract;1;A cataract is when the lens of the eye gets cloudy.
Cataract;2;It is a treatable medical condition.
Cataract;3;Cataracts can cause short-sightedness (myopia), which means you cannot see things in the distance but can see things up close.
Cataract;4;If not fixed by surgery, some types of cataracts will cause blindness (which means you cannot see anything at all).
Cataract;5;In a simple operation, the old lens can be replaced by a new plastic one.
Cataract;6;Many thousands of people have had this operation.
Allergy;1;An allergy is something which triggers an allergic reaction.
Allergy;2;This is the immune system defending the body against attack by bacteria and viruses.
Allergy;3;Sometimes the systems goes wrong, and is triggered by some quite normal food, or flares up when the family pet comes into the room.
Allergy;4;That is what the ordinary person calls an 'allergy'.
Allergy;5;When people come in contact with something they are allergic to, there can be many different reactions.
Allergy;6;Their eyes may become very itchy, and their noses may become drippy or stuffy.
Allergy;7;They may cough and sneeze.
Allergy;8;They may develop a rash called hives.
Allergy;9;Their faces may swell up.
Allergy;10;If it is a food allergy, the person may get an upset stomach.
Allergy;11;Sometimes a person's oesophagus, or throat, may swell up so much that the person can no longer breathe.
Allergy;12;This is called anaphylaxis.
Allergy;13;When this happens, a doctor must give the person a medicine called epinephrine to make the swelling go down.
Allergy;14;Some people with allergies to very common things, like bee stings or fish, carry this medicine with them so it can be used quickly in an emergency.
Allergy;15;The device they use to inject the medicine is called an epinephrine autoinjector.
Allergy;16;Some common food allergies are:   Nuts, especially peanuts   Fish or shellfish   Dairy products   Eggs   Soy products   Wheat   Fruits (kiwis and bananas)   Some common environmental allergies are:   Latex   Pollen   Ragweed   Mold   Furry pets   Bee or wasp stings   Dust mites   Tobacco smoke   Pollution
Phenylketonuria;1;Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder (a disease a person is born with) where a person's body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine.
Phenylketonuria;2;Amino acids are necessary to make proteins, an important part of the human body.
Phenylketonuria;3;"Phenylalanine only comes from the food we eat; our bodies do not make any by themselves."
Phenylketonuria;4;Average people produce an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase in their bodies.
Phenylketonuria;5;When they ingest phenylalanine, the body cannot use it, so this enzyme changes phenylalanine into tyrosine, which the body can use.
Phenylketonuria;6;In people with PKU, very little or no enzyme is made.
Phenylketonuria;7;Since the phenylalanine they eat is not being changed into tyrosine, it builds up in their bodies.
Phenylketonuria;8;This can cause problems with the way their bodies work.
Phenylketonuria;9;Symptoms vary from person to person.
Phenylketonuria;10;Because of the rarity of PKU, many symptoms go undiagnosed or unrecognized.
Phenylketonuria;11;In addition, there are variations in the categories of PKU individuals.
Phenylketonuria;12;There are untreated, early treated, late treated, those returning to diet, Hyperphe, Classical PKU, uncontrolled, and highly controlled.
Phenylketonuria;13;For your average infant a doctor will diagnose PKU with a quick blood test.
Phenylketonuria;14;Their symptom will be high PHE levels.
Phenylketonuria;15;If that infant goes undiagnosed for weeks or months, he/she may start to exhibit some or all of the following symptoms for uncontrolled PKU.
Phenylketonuria;16;The symptoms include:   focus/concentration problems   seizures   lowered intelligence   tremors   problems with memory   gait (walking) problems   anxiety   skin problems   depression   mousy odor   aggression   irritability   phobias   mental fog   slower thinking and response   hyperactivity   lethargy   social anxiety   decreased motor function and hand/eye coordination   fatigue   psychotic symptoms   mild paralysis   autistic behaviors   social withdrawals   lack of autonomy   social maturity deficits   decreased positive emotions   low self-esteem   Today, scientists know what foods have phenylalanine in them, and they have created a special diet for people with PKU.
Phenylketonuria;17;Since they cannot use it, people with PKU cannot eat foods that have a lot of phenylalanine, like eggs, meat and milk.
Phenylketonuria;18;An artificial sweetener called aspartame is also a source of phenylalanine.
Phenylketonuria;19;People with PKU take a lot of vitamins to make up for the foods they cannot eat, especially vitamins B6 and B12.
Phenylketonuria;20;Babies with PKU are fed a special formula.
Phenylketonuria;21;It has everything babies need to stay healthy, but with very little phenylalanine.
Phenylketonuria;22;There are also low protein foods like breads and flour (Made from corn and starch instead of regular wheat).
Phenylketonuria;23;Women with PKU who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have to be especially careful to follow this diet.
Phenylketonuria;24;If they do not follow the diet, their babies could be born with severe birth defects and mental retardation.
Phenylketonuria;25;Babies born to women with PKU who have followed the PKU diet throughout their pregnancy are usually healthy and do not necessarily but may develop PKU.
Phenylketonuria;26;Whether or not they have PKU themselves depends on the mother and father's genes.
Phenylketonuria;27;In fact there are people who are Carriers (Dormant Genes) that can be passed on until they resurface in the future generations.
Phenylketonuria;28;These are so far undetectable, However, since PKU is genetically recessive it takes PKU genes from both parents to cause PKU.
Phenylketonuria;29;PKU kids usually have light hair and eyes due to the effect of phenylalanine in the production of melanin.
Phenylketonuria;30;They also tend to have very fair skin which can cause them to burn easily.
Phenylketonuria;31;Solar protection is a must for those who wish to work, play, or engage in activities outdoors.
Phenylketonuria;32;Most people with PKU can live as long and healthy as anyone else if the low-phenylalanine diet is started when they are babies and continued for the rest of their lives.
Phenylketonuria;33;The symptoms will usually disappear after the diet is started.
Wart;1;Warts are growths on the skin.
Wart;2;Very often they resemble solid blisters.
Wart;3;Usually, applying pressure to a wart causes pain.
Wart;4;Warts are caused by viruses in the HPV family.
Wart;5;As there are many types of viruses in the HPV family, there are also many types of wart.
Wart;6;In most cases, warts are not dangerous, but may cause a lot of pain.
Wart;7;"The virus infects skin cells; if these skin cells move to other areas, new warts can grow there."
Wart;8;Warts contain tissue that bleeds easily.
Wart;9;A bleeding of this tissue allows the wart to spread to other places.
Wart;10;In general, coming in contact with infected tissue spreads the infection.
Wart;11;There are different ways of getting rid of a wart:   The immune system fights the virus, and can make the wart disappear.
Wart;12;"There are different drugs; many of them are corrosive acids."
Wart;13;Regular application on the skin kills the cells which were infected by the virus.
Wart;14;Other drugs strengthen the immune system.
Wart;15;Some of the acids are difficult to handle, or have side-effects.
Wart;16;Often, trained medical personnel is needed for their use.
Wart;17;Different forms of surgery exist: Using a laser, electricity, or infrared radiation.
Wart;18;Very often, the use of surgery causes scars.
Wart;19;There are different types of warts, caused by different HPV viruses:   common wart: a wart standing out, with a rough surface, usually occurs on hands or knees.
Wart;20;flat wart: A small smooth flattened wart,which can occur in large numbers.
Wart;21;"Most common on the face, neck, hands, wrists and knees;   filiform or digitate wart: These warts look like threads or fingers."
Wart;22;"Most common on the face, especially near the eyelids and lips;   plantar wart: A hard sometimes painful lump, often with many black dots in the center; usually only found on pressure points on the soles of the feet and on hands;   mosaic wart: Many plantar warts close together."
Wart;23;Usually on the hands or soles of the feet   genital wart A wart that occurs on the genitals.
Wart;24;There are different ways of getting rid of a wart:   There are some over the counter drugs, that usually contain an acid, very often salicylic acid.
Wart;25;Getting rid of a wart that way involves cleaning the area around the wart, and treating it with the acid.
Wart;26;This will slowly kill wart tissue.
Wart;27;Dead tissue can then be removed.
Wart;28;Getting rid of a wart that way usually takes several weeks.
Wart;29;There are different drugs, with different acids.
Wart;30;Some prescription drugs may contain stronger acids, such as chloroacetic acid or silver nitrate.
Wart;31;All acids are caustic.
Wart;32;This means, healthy tissue around the wart needs to be protected, before the substance is applied.
Wart;33;It is possible to kill off the wart using extreme cold (called cryotherapy).
Wart;34;A physician or a specialist doctor for skin diseases usially does this.
Wart;35;Before the cold is applied, a local anestetic is used to reduce the pain.
Wart;36;Using this method will cause scars.
Wart;37;It is possible to do a special chemotherapy, called cytostatis.
Wart;38;This will prevent cell growth.
Wart;39;It is possible to boost the immune system so it can better fight the wart.
Hepatitis;1;Hepatitis is a disease of the liver.
Hepatitis;2;In hepatitis, the liver is inflamed.
Hepatitis;3;There can be several reasons why the liver is inflamed.
Hepatitis;4;For this reason there are several kinds of hepatitis.
Hepatitis;5;The most common forms are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Most cases of Hepatitis are caused by viruses.
Hepatitis;6;Some forms are caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites.
Hepatitis;7;"The bacteria that cause tuberculosis or syphilis can also cause hepatitis; so can the parasite that causes malaria."
Hepatitis;8;Hepatitis can also be caused by alcohol.
Hepatitis;9;About one in four people who drink more than three alcoholic drinks a day (over a period of 10–15 days) will have some form of hepatitis caused by alcohol.
Hepatitis;10;Various drugs and chemicals can also cause hepatitis, most notably paracetamol (overdose), yellow phosphorous, and others.
Hepatitis;11;Hepatitis may also be caused by other diseases.
Hepatitis;12;Hepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, eating raw seafood, or drinking water with the hepatitis A virus in it.
Hepatitis;13;This happens mostly in third world countries.
Hepatitis;14;Strict personal hygiene and avoiding raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection.
Hepatitis;15;Once a person has hepatitis A, their immune system makes antibodies to fight the virus.
Hepatitis;16;This will make them immune against future infection.
Hepatitis;17;People with hepatitis A should rest, drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol.
Hepatitis;18;The time between the infection and the start of the illness can run from 15 to 45 days.
Hepatitis;19;About 15% of people with hepatitis A have symptoms from six months to a year after the first diagnosis.
Hepatitis;20;Infected people excrete the hepatitis A virus in their stool two weeks before and one week after the appearance of jaundice.
Hepatitis;21;There is a vaccine for hepatitis A.
Hepatitis;22;It will protect against hepatitis A for life.
Hepatitis;23;Hepatitis B is not spread by food or casual contact.
Hepatitis;24;Instead, hepatitis B is spread by blood or body fluids from an infected person.
Hepatitis;25;A baby can get it from its mother during childbirth, and it can also be spread by sexual contact, use of street drugs, and unsafe medical care.
Hepatitis;26;Some people just have hepatitis B for a little while and then suppress the infection.
Hepatitis;27;Others can be infected for life, usually with few or no symptoms for many years.
Hepatitis;28;Hepatitis B sometimes damages the liver severely, and can cause cancer.
Hepatitis;29;There is a vaccine that can prevent hepatitis B.
Hepatitis;30;There is no cure for hepatitis B, but there is treatment.
Hepatitis;31;Hepatitis C is not spread by food or casual contact.
Hepatitis;32;It is spread in ways that are similar to hepatitis B.
Hepatitis;33;There is no vaccine, and the treatment is somewhat unpleasant.
Hepatitis;34;People with hepatitis C who drink alcohol greatly increase their risk for liver damage.

Tourette syndrome;1;Tourette syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder.
Tourette syndrome;2;Tourette syndrome can also be called Tourette's syndrome, Tourette's disorder, GTS, Tourette's, or TS.
Tourette syndrome;3;People that have Tourette's have tics (movements or sounds that the person cannot easily control).
Tourette syndrome;4;Tourette's is normally inherited, and starts in childhood.
Tourette syndrome;5;People who have Tourette's have a normal life expectancy and normal intelligence.
Tourette syndrome;6;Tics are normally not as bad as people get older.
Tourette syndrome;7;Adults with severe Tourette's are rare.
Tourette syndrome;8;Fewer than 15% of people with Tourette's have coprolalia.
Tourette syndrome;9;Coprolalia is using words or phrases that some people might find offensive without being able to stop saying them.
Tourette syndrome;10;These may include curse words.
Tourette syndrome;11;However the stereotypical Tourette's sufferer has coprolalia.
Tourette syndrome;12;Most people with Tourette's do not need treatment.
Tourette syndrome;13;There are drugs that can help people manage tics.
Tourette syndrome;14;There are also therapies that can help people live easier with Tourette's.
Tourette syndrome;15;The disease is named after Georges Gilles de la Tourette.
Tourette syndrome;16;He was one of the first doctors to describe the symptoms.
Tourette syndrome;17;Also, people who have this syndrome might feel very depressed and have high chance to get depression.

Kidney failure;1;Kidney failure (also called renal failure) is a term used to describe when a person's kidneys stop working properly, or fail.
Kidney failure;2;Kidney failure can be divided into two categories: chronic renal failure, and acute renal failure.
Kidney failure;3;Chronic renal failure develops slowly, and there are not many noticeable symptoms at first.
Kidney failure;4;Chronic renal failure can be a sign of other diseases, like IgA nephritis, glomerulonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis, and urinary retention.
Kidney failure;5;Chronic renal failure will eventually develop into end-stage renal failure if it is left untreated.
Kidney failure;6;End-stage renal failure can only be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Kidney failure;7;Acute renal failure develops in a short time, and symptoms are more noticeable.
Kidney failure;8;Symptoms include:   Urinating less than usual   Changes in the amount of water in the body   Electrolyte levels that are not normal   The cause of acute renal failure needs to be found quickly.
Kidney failure;9;Dialysis is often needed to prevent permanent damage to the body while the cause is being found.
Kidney failure;10;It is possible to have acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure.
Kidney failure;11;"This is called "" acute-on-chronic renal failure. """
Shock (circulatory);1;A person is in shock when blood is not sufficient to bring oxygen to the brain.
Shock (circulatory);2;The shock is progressive and can be deadly if it is not quickly made well.
Shock (circulatory);3;The normal first aid action is the Trendelenburg position, the person is lying face upward, with his legs lifted.
Shock (circulatory);4;The blood is forced to flow to the brain.
Tonsillitis;1;Tonsillitis is a disease.
Tonsillitis;2;It is also known as pharyngitis, laryngitis and Tonsillar infection.
Tonsillitis;3;Tonsillitis is caused by either a virus or bacteria.
Tonsillitis;4;It is the inflammation and infection of the tonsils.
Tonsillitis;5;The tonsils are in the back of the throat.
Tonsillitis;6;The tonsils get inflamed and red.
Tonsillitis;7;Other symptoms include headaches, fevers, back and neck aches, chills, bad breath, weak voice, fatigue, having trouble swallowing, and more.
Tonsillitis;8;There are treatments for tonsillitis.
Tonsillitis;9;One treatment is antibiotics.
Tonsillitis;10;Medicines to relieve pain like Tylenol and Advil are also suggested.
Tonsillitis;11;The tonsils may be removed surgically if it is medically necessary.
Tonsillitis;12;This operation is called a tonsillectomy.
Tonsillitis;13;It is the most effective way to get rid of the infection.
Tonsillitis;14;All kinds of tonsillitis are contagious.
Tonsillitis;15;Tonsillitis is spread by human contact.
Encephalitis;1;Encephalitis is sudden inflammation (swelling) in the brain.
Encephalitis;2;It is usually caused by viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens.
Encephalitis;3;As the brain swells, it can get damaged when it gets crushed against the skull.
Encephalitis;4;Encephalitis can cause serious symptoms, like seizures and strokes, and can be fatal.
Encephalitis;5;In 2013, encephalitis killed about 77,000 people in the world.
Encephalitis;6;Usually, adults with encephalitis have a fever that starts suddenly, a headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures.
Encephalitis;7;Younger children or infants may be irritable (easily upset), not want to eat, and have a fever.
Encephalitis;8;Usually, patients are either very tired or confused.
Encephalitis;9;A stiff neck is a sign that the person has either meningitis (inflammation of the meninges, which cover the brain) or meningoencephalitis (swelling of both the meninges and the brain).
Encephalitis;10;Viral encephalitis can happen when a virus infects the brain.
Encephalitis;11;The most common causes are the rabies virus, Herpes Simplex Virus(HSV), the polio virus, and the measles virus.
Encephalitis;12;Viral encephalitis can also be caused by a latent virus - a virus that hides from the body's immune system the brain's nerve cells.
Encephalitis;13;Two examples of viruses that cause latent infection are the varicella-zoster viruses, which can hide in the brain after causing chicken pox, and the herpes simplex virus.
Encephalitis;14;About 100 different viruses can infect the brain.
Encephalitis;15;Other examples include West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.
Encephalitis;16;Encephalitis can happen when a person gets a bacterial infection, like bacterial meningitis.
Encephalitis;17;It can also be a complication of an infectious disease that a person already has, like syphilis.
Encephalitis;18;"This is called "" secondary encephalitis. """
Encephalitis;19;"Examples of other bacteria which can cause encephalitis are Staphylococcus aureus, which causes toxic shock syndrome; Bordetella pertussis, which causes pertussis (whooping cough); and types of Borellia bacteria, which cause Lyme disease."
Encephalitis;20;Some parasites can infect the brain, especially in people who have weak immune systems.
Encephalitis;21;"Examples include Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis; two parasites from the species Trypanosoma brucei, which cause African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness); and Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria."
Encephalitis;22;Autoimmune diseases can cause encephalitis if the body's immune system attacks the brain, the spinal cord, and their nerves.
Encephalitis;23;Two examples are autoimmune encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalitis.
Encephalitis;24;"Encephalitis can be diagnosed in a few different ways:   An MRI (brain scan) can show brain swelling, and also show whether there are other brain problems causing a patient's symptoms   An EEG (a picture of the brain's electrical activity) will show signals that are not normal   A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will show whether there is an infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (which bathes the brain and spinal cord)   Blood tests or urine tests may show whether a person has encephalitis, or if they have another illness instead   Some treatments for encephalitis depend on the cause:   Viral encephalitis is treated with anti-viral medications   Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibiotic medications   Other treatments are "" supportive "" - they treat the symptoms of encephalitis."
Encephalitis;25;For example:   Steroid medications are used to decrease swelling in the brain   Anticonvulsant medications can stop seizures   Sedative medications can help with restlessness and irritability   Acetaminophen can decrease fever and headache   Physical therapy and speech therapy can help if the person has trouble moving or speaking after their infection is gone   Vaccines have made encephalitis from some diseases much less common.
Encephalitis;26;These diseases include measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, varicella (chicken pox), and pertussis (whooping cough).
Encephalitis;27;There are also vaccines for rabies, bacterial meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and some other diseases that can cause encephalitis.
Encephalitis;28;People can protect themselves from diseases that are spread by insects, like Lyme disease and malaria, by avoiding insect bites.
Encephalitis;29;"For example, they can use bug spray; wear long sleeves and long pants; sleep under a mosquito net; and make sure they have good window and door screens."
Drowning;1;Drowning means dying from not being able to breathe in air and breathing in water or another liquid.
Drowning;2;Near drowning is the survival of drowning where the person passes out or breathes in water, and can cause serious problems, including death, after the event.
Drowning;3;That means that near drowning can also need attention by doctors.
Drowning;4;Secondary drowning is death caused by chemical or biological changes in the lungs after a near drowning incident.
Drowning;5;In many countries, drowning is one of the biggest causes of death for children under 14 years old.
Drowning;6;Children have drowned in wading pools and even bath tubs.
Drowning;7;Many people drown in countries where there is a lot of water, especially if they swim in dangerous waters.
Drowning;8;For example, in the United Kingdom there are about 450 drownings each year (that is: 1 per 150,000 of its people), and in the United States there are about 6,500 drownings (or around 1 per 50,000 of its people).
Drowning;9;Drowning related injuries are the fifth most likely cause of accidental death in the US.
Drowning;10;In some places, drowning is the second most likely cause of injury and death for children.
Drowning;11;Victims are more likely to be male, young or teenage.
Drowning;12;Surveys say that 10% of children under 5 have been through a situation where they could have drowned.
Burping;1;Burping is when gas comes out of the stomach through the mouth.
Burping;2;"Burping happens when air is trapped in the stomach. """
Burping;3;"Esophageal speech "" means to "" burp "" words."
Athlete's foot;1;Athlete's Foot is a condition where the foot is dry and cracked, which can be mildly painful.
Athlete's foot;2;It was named athlete's foot because it was common in people who play sports or do exercise.
Athlete's foot;3;The infection can be spread to other areas of the body, such as the armpits, knees and elbows.
Athlete's foot;4;Athlete's foot causes scaling, flaking, itching, blisters and cracked skin.
Athlete's foot;5;It can be cured by using antibiotics.
Amnesia;1;Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory.
Amnesia;2;It is a loss of memory, that is to say, a person cannot remember certain things.
Amnesia;3;Amnesia can be caused when someone has brain damage, a disease or when something really stressful happens.
Amnesia;4;"There are two "" main types "" :   Anterograde amnesia: Short term memory is not transferred to long-term memory any more."
Amnesia;5;People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time.
Amnesia;6;Retrograde amnesia: The person can no longer recall information that happened before a certain date.
Amnesia;7;The date is usually the date of an accident or an operation.
Amnesia;8;"The fact that adults usually cannot remember events that occurred in early childhood is called "" infantile amnesia "" ."
Amnesia;9;It is attributed to the development of the brain or that of the child.
Amnesia;10;It is not seen as a form of amnesia comparable to the other types.
Amnesia;11;There are three main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person.
Amnesia;12;Head trauma.
Amnesia;13;This includes any kind of injury to the brain that might cause amnesia.
Amnesia;14;Traumatic events.
Amnesia;15;This happens when a person's mind is so stressed that it chooses to forget what happened rather than to deal with it.
Amnesia;16;Physical deficiencies.
Amnesia;17;These are things that happen to your brain but it is different than head trauma because it mostly deals with complications that happen after surgery.
Amnesia;18;"Some other different types of amnesia include:   Caused by an [Injury trauma], for example a head injury; called post-traumatic amnesia."
Amnesia;19;Dissociative amnesia: Here the cause is psychological, and usually not related to physical damage in the brain.
Amnesia;20;"This includes   Repressed memory (where it is not possible to remember a specific event) - The memory is usually still there, but the person blocks access to it; Stressful events such as being raped may lead to Dissociative amnesia   Childhood amnesia - the inability of adults to remember certain parts of their childhood."
Amnesia;21;Drug (usually [alcohol])-induced blackout - anterograde amnesia, affecting the immediate past   Amnesia can be permanent, or it can be temporary.
Amnesia;22;Damage to the [brain], or the use of certain [drug]s can cause amnesia.
Amnesia;23;Some of these drugs are [sedative]s. Another well known cause for amnesia can be drinking too much [alcohol].
Amnesia;24;Those kinds of causes are called organic, because they can been directly seen.
Amnesia;25;Other causes cannot directly be seen, they are called functional.
Amnesia;26;Rather they are [psychology psychological] in their nature.
Amnesia;27;People may want to shield off a traumatic event they witnessed, for example.
Amnesia;28;"Another minor cause of amnesia is "" heartbreak "" in a relationship."
Amnesia;29;It can lead to trauma, but it is not necessarily traumatic.
Amnesia;30;Sometimes certain types of amnesia fix themselves without being treated.
Amnesia;31;There are also different types of therapy that work with the brain to help with amnesia.
Amnesia;32;There is no medicine that can directly help with amnesia.
Coronary artery disease;1;Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart disease, is a heart disease.
Coronary artery disease;2;"( "" Coronary "" means "" the blood vessels of the heart "" .)"
Coronary artery disease;3;Coronary heart disease causes plaque to build up inside the coronary arteries.
Coronary artery disease;4;This causes the coronary arteries to become narrower.
Coronary artery disease;5;An artery is a blood vessel - a tube that carries blood.
Coronary artery disease;6;After the heart supplies blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients, the arteries carry the blood to different parts of the body.
Coronary artery disease;7;The coronary arteries are very important: they supply blood to the heart muscle.
Coronary artery disease;8;So when the coronary arteries become narrower, less blood gets to the heart muscle.
Coronary artery disease;9;Most people with coronary heart disease can feel healthy for years before they start experiencing symptoms.
Coronary artery disease;10;The most common symptom is a heart attack.
Coronary artery disease;11;If coronary heart disease is not treated, some of the plaques in the coronary arteries can break away and block the blood flow to the heart.
Coronary artery disease;12;Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death.
Coronary artery disease;13;It is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old.
Coronary artery disease;14;Men are 10 times more likely to get coronary heart disease than women.
Coronary artery disease;15;Atherosclerosis is a form of heart disease.
Coronary artery disease;16;It causes fatty materials (like cholesterol) to build up in the arteries, forming harder materials called plaques.
Coronary artery disease;17;This causes the arteries to become harder.
Coronary artery disease;18;It also makes it more difficult for blood to flow through the arteries.
Coronary artery disease;19;This can cause blood clots to form, blocking blood from traveling through the arteries.
Coronary artery disease;20;Small pieces of plaque can also break off and block smaller blood vessels.
Coronary artery disease;21;If an artery becomes blocked completely, it causes serious problems.
Coronary artery disease;22;All cells, tissues, and organs in the body need oxygen and nutrients (carried by blood) to survive.
Coronary artery disease;23;If cells or tissues are not supplied with enough blood, they will die.
Coronary artery disease;24;(This is called necrosis.)
Coronary artery disease;25;When this happens in the coronary arteries, a section of the heart dies.
Coronary artery disease;26;This can cause a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) to happen.
Coronary artery disease;27;People can do many different things to keep themselves from getting coronary heart disease:   They can change their diet.
Coronary artery disease;28;For example, they can eat fewer fatty foods, and take in as few saturated fats as possible.
Coronary artery disease;29;They can eat more vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains.
Coronary artery disease;30;They can avoid drinking alcohol, and can take in less salt.
Coronary artery disease;31;They can exercise regularly.
Coronary artery disease;32;They can avoid becoming overweight or obese by doing things to control their weight.
Gingivitis;1;Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth.
Gingivitis;2;Gingivitis may be caused by a buildup of plaque and tartar because the teeth have not been cleaned properly.
Gingivitis;3;It can also be a manifestation of a systemic disease, as in diabetes or AIDS.
Gingivitis;4;Sometimes excessive brushing or flossing can wear out the gums causing gum recession.
Gingivitis;5;If gingivitis is not treated by proper oral hygiene, it can lead to periodontitis, which is a more advanced state of gum disease, that affects the bone and is harder to treat.

Conjoined twins;1;'Conjoined twins are twins whose bodies are joined together at birth.
Conjoined twins;2;This happens where the zygote of identical twins fails to completely separate.
Conjoined twins;3;Conjoined twins occur in an estimated one in 200,000 births, and approximately half are stillborn.
Conjoined twins;4;The overall survival rate for conjoined twins is between 5% and 25%.
Conjoined twins;5;Conjoined twins are more likely to be female (70-75%).
Conjoined twins;6;Daisy and Violet Hilton are a famous pair of conjoined twins.
Conjoined twins;7;They were born in Brighton and were kept on top of the Evening Star pub, where they were taught to dance by a cruel barmaid.
Conjoined twins;8;She then sold them and they toured Vaudeville.
Conjoined twins;9;They became famous in the movie Freaks and lived long lives, eventually getting married.
Bipolar disorder;1;Bipolar disorder (also known as manic depression) is a mental illness where a person will have repeated, long-lasting feelings (episodes) of high (mania) and low mood (depression).
Bipolar disorder;2;It may occur with or without cycles of normal mood, called euthymia.
Bipolar disorder;3;"A mixed episode occurs when both mania and depression are present at the same time.   """
Bipolar disorder;4;"Bipolar "" literally means "" two poles "" or two extremes in how much energy the brain has."
Bipolar disorder;5;Sometimes, a person can experience something called mania.
Bipolar disorder;6;Mania is when a person's brain goes into a high-energy state.
Bipolar disorder;7;When in a high-energy state, mania can cause extreme emotions such as panic attacks or extreme happiness such as euphoria.
Bipolar disorder;8;This feeling is often followed by a period of depression, which is a low-energy state.
Bipolar disorder;9;A person who is depressed may act sad or hopeless.
Bipolar disorder;10;People with bipolar disorder switch between these two states.
Bipolar disorder;11;People who are in a manic state are often over-confident and very optimistic.
Bipolar disorder;12;This can cause them to take large risks and do things that are not normal for them to do.
Bipolar disorder;13;Manic episodes last for at least a week, but can last as long as three to six months.
Bipolar disorder;14;They are usually followed by a depressive episode.
Bipolar disorder;15;A person who is manic may talk very quickly with no pauses, have thoughts that change very quickly, or act without thinking.
Bipolar disorder;16;They may also experience psychosis, where they cannot tell what is real and what is not.
Bipolar disorder;17;They may think that they are unstoppable or that they are on a mission for God.
Bipolar disorder;18;Mania may become so severe that it can affect the person’s ability to work or interact with others.
Bipolar disorder;19;Every person is different, so it is important to remember that these things do not happen to all people with bipolar disorder.
Bipolar disorder;20;Hypomania is a less extreme version of mania.
Bipolar disorder;21;Someone who is hypomanic will have symptoms similar to mania.
Bipolar disorder;22;They may have increased energy and may deny that anything is wrong.
Bipolar disorder;23;A hypomanic episode may last from a few days to a few months.
Bipolar disorder;24;People who are in a depressive state are often sad and pessimistic.
Bipolar disorder;25;They may lose interest in activities they usually like, or become isolated and lonely.
Bipolar disorder;26;Other symptoms include anxiety, hopelessness, changes in sleep, and suicidal thoughts.
Bipolar disorder;27;A depressive episode can last from a few weeks to several months.
Bipolar disorder;28;When bipolar disorder develops at a young age, the first few episodes are usually depressive.
Bipolar disorder;29;Because a manic or hypomanic episode is needed to diagnose bipolar disorder, some people are diagnosed with major depression at first.
Bipolar disorder;30;Bipolar disorder is an illness that can show in different ways.
Bipolar disorder;31;It is often diagnosed in adolescents or young adults.
Bipolar disorder;32;"A few subtypes have been identified; these subtypes mostly describe the nature of the "" episodes "" of the disease:   Bipolar I disorder: A person with bipolar I has had at least one manic episode."
Bipolar disorder;33;Depressive episodes also occur in people with bipolar I, but are not required for a diagnosis.
Bipolar disorder;34;Bipolar II disorder: A person with bipolar II has had no manic episodes, but at least one hypomanic episode.
Bipolar disorder;35;They have also had at least one major depressive episode.
Bipolar disorder;36;Cyclothymia: A person with cyclothymia has had both hypomanic and feelings of depression.
Bipolar disorder;37;These feelings of depression are not extreme enough to be considered a depressive episode.
Bipolar disorder;38;The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown.
Bipolar disorder;39;It is estimated that there is a 71 percent chance of bipolar disorder passing from parent to child.
Bipolar disorder;40;If one identical twin has bipolar disorder, there is a 40 to 70 percent chance that the other will develop bipolar disorder in their lifetime.
Bipolar disorder;41;MRI studies have shown that certain parts of the brain responsible for mood regulation are larger in bipolar patients.
Bipolar disorder;42;It is also possible for bipolar disorder to develop after a stroke, brain injury, or certain infections.
Bipolar disorder;43;Like most mental illnesses, there are ways to treat bipolar disorder.
Bipolar disorder;44;The most common way to treat bipolar disorder is by using medications called mood stabilizers.
Bipolar disorder;45;These medicines prevent and control the manic and depressive episodes.
Bipolar disorder;46;One of the most common mood stabilizers is lithium.
Bipolar disorder;47;Therapy can also be used to control the symptoms.
Bipolar disorder;48;The same treatments and medicines do not work for everyone, and it is not uncommon for people to have symptoms return if they stop taking medication.
Bipolar disorder;49;Things like this can make bipolar disorder a difficult illness to live with, but educating patients about it makes it easier.
Bipolar disorder;50;Sometimes, people need to be treated against their will.
Bipolar disorder;51;Patients may be thinking about or have tried to commit suicide, or they may be unable to see their situation properly.
Bipolar disorder;52;In many cases, teaching people about their disease helps.
Bipolar disorder;53;When they have gone through the phases of the illness a few times, they often see that treatment can make their life easier.

Dissociative identity disorder;1;Dissociative identity disorder (DID), is a mental disorder.
Dissociative identity disorder;2;It was called multiple personality disorder (MPD).
Dissociative identity disorder;3;It is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual DSM IV.
Dissociative identity disorder;4;This is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it.
Dissociative identity disorder;5;"The main symptoms of DID are a person showing two or more "" identities "" or "" personality states "" ."
Dissociative identity disorder;6;The person behaves differently depending which identity is in control.
Dissociative identity disorder;7;The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget.
Dissociative identity disorder;8;A person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by drugs, illness or (with children) pretending to play with imaginary friends.
Dissociative identity disorder;9;Doctors must also rule out pretending to have DID for attention or sympathy, and malingering (pretending to have DID for some personal gain).
Dissociative identity disorder;10;Most patients with DID are also diagnosed with other mental disorders.
Dissociative identity disorder;11;"The DSM IV uses the terms "" identity "" , "" personality states "" and "" alternate identities "" when talking about DID and other people use the term "" alters "" to mean the same thing."
Dissociative identity disorder;12;These words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition.
Dissociative identity disorder;13;"Professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a personality; other terms, including dissociation and amnesia, may also be defined differently by different professionals."
Dissociative identity disorder;14;When talking about DID, saying someone changes personalities or alters means the person speaks and acts differently, and usually responds to a different name.
Dissociative identity disorder;15;Dissociation is a symptom.
Dissociative identity disorder;16;Most people experience normal dissociation, where they stop paying attention to what is happening around them.
Dissociative identity disorder;17;People with DID have pathological dissociation, which is much more serious.
Dissociative identity disorder;18;It involves problems with memory and attention that make it hard for people to work, shop and have relationships with other people.
Dissociative identity disorder;19;Everyone can dissociate but some people can do it much more easily and to an extreme that can be unhealthy.
Dissociative identity disorder;20;Some doctors think trauma causes the dissociation that is seen in disorders like DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;21;"According to the DSM-IV, the symptoms of DID are "" the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states "" (which are often called "" alters "" ), as well as forgetting things that people normally don't forget."
Dissociative identity disorder;22;Also, the symptoms cannot be caused by drugs or normal childhood play.
Dissociative identity disorder;23;People can report having a lot of alters, or just a couple.
Dissociative identity disorder;24;Most people diagnosed with DID have less than ten, though some have said they have several thousand.
Dissociative identity disorder;25;A person diagnosed with DID cannot be diagnosed with another dissociative disorder.
Dissociative identity disorder;26;Because people with DID hear voices of different alters, it may be confused with schizophrenia.
Dissociative identity disorder;27;However, the two problems are very different and doctors can usually tell if a patient has DID or schizophrenia by asking the right questions.
Dissociative identity disorder;28;DID is always diagnosed by what patients tell their doctors and what the doctor thinks this means.
Dissociative identity disorder;29;There are no objective tests using blood or machines that can tell if someone has DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;30;Though people have tried diagnosing and studying DID using medical imaging or brain scanning.
Dissociative identity disorder;31;"The DSM uses the following criteria to diagnose DID:   At least two "" distinct identities "" that alternate control of behavior   Inability to recall "" important personal information too great "" to be attributed to "" ordinary forgetfulness ""   None of the above are due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition   The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) uses the term multiple personality disorder instead of dissociative identity disorder."
Dissociative identity disorder;32;"It classifies DID in section F44.8, "" Other dissociative [conversion] disorders "" ."
Dissociative identity disorder;33;There are two main ideas about what causes DID, but there is still disagreement about which is correct.
Dissociative identity disorder;34;The trauma model says that DID is caused by parents or family that abuse or neglect their children.
Dissociative identity disorder;35;Some of these children deny the abuse is happening or pretend it is happening to someone else, and this eventually becomes a different identity or alter.
Dissociative identity disorder;36;Most people diagnosed with DID say they remember being abused by their parents or other caregivers when they were children.
Dissociative identity disorder;37;When asked about their childhood, patients with DID are more likely to say they were abused or neglected than people with any other diagnosis.
Dissociative identity disorder;38;However, the idea that DID develops in childhood is disputed because childhood memories are not very reliable and it is not clear if the abuse actually happened.
Dissociative identity disorder;39;Though DID has been diagnosed in children, there are reasons to believe the diagnosis is because of the influence of parents and doctors rather than abuse.
Dissociative identity disorder;40;There is not enough good scientific evidence about DID in childhood to be sure DID is actually caused by abuse or something else.
Dissociative identity disorder;41;The iatrogenic or sociocognitive model (SCM) of DID says it is created during psychotherapy when the therapist creates false memories and patients become convinced they have multiple personalities.
Dissociative identity disorder;42;Some patients may be more likely to develop DID in these circumstances because they are naturally more likely to accept their therapists are right about DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;43;SCM supporters also think that patients have seen DID in movies and books, and this shows them how people with DID are supposed to behave, which makes it easier for them to change their behavior when they are supposed to be a new alter.
Dissociative identity disorder;44;They also say the criteria used by the DSM are unclear which makes it hard to agree whether a patient has DID or another diagnosis.
Dissociative identity disorder;45;A middle position says that trauma may change how the brain remembers things which makes it easier to remember things that did not actually happen.
Dissociative identity disorder;46;It has also been suggested that early trauma may make children more likely to use their imaginations to pretend abuse or other painful situations are not happening, and if they enter therapy when they are older, it is easier for therapists to convince them they have DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;47;There is no treatment approach that has been scientifically proven to work.
Dissociative identity disorder;48;Most therapists who treat patients with DID use several different approaches.
Dissociative identity disorder;49;Therapy usually lasts for several years, and does not always work.
Dissociative identity disorder;50;Some therapists try to reduce or eliminate the alters so the patient only has one personality, while others do not.
Dissociative identity disorder;51;The ISSTD recommends first improving a patient's ability to deal with symptoms and live more normal lives, then trying to deal with traumatic memories.
Dissociative identity disorder;52;The final step is bringing all the identities together so the patient can access all of their memories.
Dissociative identity disorder;53;Sometimes patients with DID will get better without any help, but this is not common.
Dissociative identity disorder;54;Patients with more diagnoses than just DID often take longer to improve.
Dissociative identity disorder;55;There have been no large-scale studies to learn how common DID is.
Dissociative identity disorder;56;The ISSTD says DID occurs in between 1 and 3% in the general population, and between 1 and 5% in groups of patients in hospitals.
Dissociative identity disorder;57;DID is more common in women than in men but this may be caused by men with DID being sent to prison instead of hospitals.
Dissociative identity disorder;58;The number of people diagnosed with DID increased from about 200 in 1970 to about 20,000 in the 1990s.
Dissociative identity disorder;59;According to the ISSTD this is because doctors did not have the training or experience to recognize DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;60;Instead they diagnosed people with depression, PTSD or borderline personality disorder.
Dissociative identity disorder;61;People who support the SCM say the increase in diagnoses was because a small number of doctors diagnosed a large number of people and because a large number of therapists began using types of psychotherapy that made people think they had DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;62;Before 1900 it was thought DID was caused by spirits or ghosts who controlled people's behavior.
Dissociative identity disorder;63;The first case of DID described in medicine was in 1646 by the Swiss doctor Paracelsus.
Dissociative identity disorder;64;DID was very uncommon until the 1970s.
Dissociative identity disorder;65;Between 1980 and 1990 the number of cases reported in medicine went from about 200 to more than 20,000.
Dissociative identity disorder;66;"In 1994, the 4th edition of the DSM was published, which changed the name from "" multiple personality disorder "" to "" dissociative identity disorder "" ."
Dissociative identity disorder;67;The DSM also changed how DID was diagnosed.
Dissociative identity disorder;68;Many scientific articles were written about DID during the same period, though after 1995 the number of articles published every year decreased.
Dissociative identity disorder;69;Today there is little research on DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;70;Even though DID is a very rare, there are a lot of books, plays and movies about people with DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;71;In 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson published the short book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which was very popular.
Dissociative identity disorder;72;People later thought that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were examples of someone with DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;73;The Three Faces Of Eve was a movie made in 1957 about a woman with DID.
Dissociative identity disorder;74;Sybil, a popular book about a woman with DID, was published in 1973.
Dissociative identity disorder;75;It was made into a movie in 1976, and a second time in 2007.
Dissociative identity disorder;76;A survey done in 2001 of American and Canadian psychiatrists found that there was a lot of disagreement and skepticism about diagnosing DID and if the diagnosis was based on enough good quality science.
Dissociative identity disorder;77;Lawyers and doctors who work with the law also consider DID to be very controversial.
Dissociative identity disorder;78;Since the 1990s, DID has become more common in courts.
Dissociative identity disorder;79;People have tried to avoid going to prison for such crimes as murder and serial rape by claiming to have DID, and lawyers and judges are concerned about people pretending to have DID to avoid going to prison.
Dissociative identity disorder;80;The first time this happened was in 1976, and since that time most people who commit crimes claim it was because of DID have gone to prison.
Encephalopathy;1;Encephalopathy means problem of the brain.
Encephalopathy;2;Most of the time, it is used by medical doctors, to speak about changed brains and thus changed thinking or changed behavior.

Prion;1;A prion is an infectious protein.
Prion;2;"The word is short for "" proteinaceous infectious particles "" ."
Prion;3;All known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neural tissue.
Prion;4;At present they cannot be treated and always end in death.
Prion;5;Prions cause many forms of encephalitis, or brain disease, such as scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) and kuru.
Prion;6;Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the infected animals.
Prion;7;While normal proteins have lots of alpha helices, or twisted parts, changed proteins have lots of beta sheets, or flat parts.
Prion;8;The word is pronounced pree-on.
Prion;9;Because prions are proteins, and proteins cannot reproduce themselves, it is a mystery how prions work.
Prion;10;A lot of molecular biology research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves, with no clear result so far.
Prion;11;Prion disease
Endocarditis;1;Endocarditis is an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart.
Endocarditis;2;Endocarditis most often affects the heart valves.
Endocarditis;3;The heart valves are a part of the human body that does not get blood.
Endocarditis;4;This is odd because they are a part of the heart itself.
Endocarditis;5;Because of this, if one of the valves gets infected with bacteria or protozoa, the body can not defend itself against those bacteria.
Endocarditis;6;This can cause the valve to not work the way it should.
Porphyria;1;Porphyria is the name for certain medical conditions or diseases, which have been known since the days of Hippocrates.
Porphyria;2;Those who suffer from the disease can not make certain substances in the blood.
Porphyria;3;They have disorders of certain enzymes which normally work in the production of porphyrins and heme.
Porphyria;4;The condition is usually caused by a genetic deficiency, but chemicals which affect metabolism may also cause it.
Porphyria;5;Arsenic is an example.
Porphyria;6;It can be triggered by various drugs or by some environmental conditions.
Porphyria;7;The disease causes skin problems, or some diseases of the nervous system, or both.
Porphyria;8;Severe pain is often present.
Porphyria;9;Drugs are available that can at least treat the symptoms.
Porphyria;10;This disease is most common in European countries and often affects the skin.
Porphyria;11;When someone is affected by porphyria they will start to lose their hair about two weeks after having an attack.
Porphyria;12;There is no cure for the hair loss.
Porphyria;13;However, there is medication available to help prevent attacks.
Decapitation;1;Decapitation or beheading is the act of cutting off the head from the rest of the body of a living thing.
Decapitation;2;Beheading usually means that the removal of the head is deliberate.
Decapitation;3;It is generally done during an execution with an axe, sword, or guillotine.
Decapitation;4;If the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional, it is called decapitation.
Decapitation;5;It can happen because of an auto accident, explosion, factory accident, a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident.
Decapitation;6;Decapitation is always fatal, that is, the result is always death.
Decapitation;7;This is because it causes all other organs to stop receiving nervous signals from the brain that are needed to function, while the supply of blood, and therefore oxygen, to the brain itself is also cut off.
Decapitation;8;Decapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead.
Decapitation;9;In these situations, the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning.
Decapitation;10;Beheading was the usual means of death penalty in Scandinavian countries in the past.
Decapitation;11;Noblemen were beheaded with a sword, commoners with an axe.
Decapitation;12;The last execution by beheading in Finland occurred in 1822, when a farmhand Tahvo Putkonen was beheaded for murder.
Decapitation;13;The last beheading in Sweden occurred in 1910, when Johan Andersson-Ander was guillotined for murder.
Decapitation;14;Also Germany, France and Belgium favoured beheading in the past.
Decapitation;15;In those countries was carried out by guillotine.
Decapitation;16;Last beheading in Europe occurred 1977, when a Tunisian murderer Hamida Djandoubi was guillotined in France.
Decapitation;17;Some countries, especially Arab countries or former French colonies, still use beheading as the means of execution.
Decapitation;18;In Saudi Arabia, the convicts are beheaded with a sword.
Decapitation;19;The executioner who performs beheadings is called a headsman.
Decapitation;20;The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has had centuries of public beheadings, but in 2013 is considering firing squads as an alternative means of execution.

Stillbirth;1;A stillbirth happens when a fetus (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother or dies during delivery (childbirth).
Stillbirth;2;It is said that the delivered baby is stillborn.
Stillbirth;3;Stillbirth is different from a miscarriage because a stillbirth happens after the baby has been living inside its mother 20 to 24 weeks (depending on the country).
Stillbirth;4;It is called a miscarriage if the baby lived inside the mother for less time.
Stillbirth;5;The causes of many stillbirths are unknown, even when special tests are done to learn the cause.
Stillbirth;6;nicotine, alcohol, or drugs taken by the mother during pregnancy   physical trauma   radiation poisoning   Rh disease   umbilical cord problems   The number of stillbirths in the United States is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20 minutes.
Stillbirth;7;In developing countries, where medical care is not as advanced or good, the number of stillbirths is higher.
Stillbirth;8;In Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is about 1 in 200 babies.
Stillbirth;9;The death of the baby is usually treated like the death of an older baby.
Stillbirth;10;The family may have a funeral.
Stillbirth;11;The body of the dead baby can be buried or cremated (burned).
Stillbirth;12;In some places, there are special places for putting the bodies or the ashes of stillborn babies.
Stillbirth;13;The mother may be ill.
Stillbirth;14;Her body may be hurt from having the baby.
Stillbirth;15;In the UK, any baby that leaves its mother's body after 24 weeks and does not show any signs of life is called a stillbirth.
Stillbirth;16;The mother or father must tell the government about the baby.
Stillbirth;17;A Stillbirth Certificate is given to the family.
Stillbirth;18;In Australia, any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be reported to the government.
Stillbirth;19;The United States does not have a formal definition of stillborn babies.
Stillbirth;20;All pregnancies are legally called either: live birth, fetal death, or induced termination of pregnancy (abortion).
Stillbirth;21;The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage.
Stillbirth;22;However, it is recommended to register infants who weighed over 350 grams or who lived over 19 weeks inside the mother before dying.

Ventricular fibrillation;1;"Ventricular fibrillation (often shortened to VF or V-Fib) is a type of arrhythmia of the heart. """
Ventricular fibrillation;2;"Arrhythmia "" means the heart is not beating normally."
Ventricular fibrillation;3;When a person is in ventricular fibrillation, the heart does not beat in any kind of pattern.
Ventricular fibrillation;4;Instead, it quivers and twitches very quickly.
Ventricular fibrillation;5;"This problem is called "" ventricular "" fibrillation because it affects the ventricles of the heart."
Ventricular fibrillation;6;The ventricles are the biggest parts of the heart.
Ventricular fibrillation;7;Their job is to pump blood (which carries oxygen) to the lungs and the rest of the body.
Ventricular fibrillation;8;When a person is in ventricular fibrillation, the ventricles cannot do this job.
Ventricular fibrillation;9;This means that the lungs, brain, and other organs will not get enough blood or oxygen.
Ventricular fibrillation;10;Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency.
Ventricular fibrillation;11;Without enough blood and oxygen, no part of the body can survive.
Ventricular fibrillation;12;If ventricular fibrillation continues for long enough, the blood will stop circulating around the body.
Ventricular fibrillation;13;The person's breathing and heart will stop.
Ventricular fibrillation;14;The person will die unless they get treatment quickly.
Ventricular fibrillation;15;Ventricular fibrillation can be stopped by shocking the person with electricity from a defibrillator.
Ventricular fibrillation;16;If a defibrillator is not available, CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be done to keep the blood flowing until an ambulance comes or a defibrillator is available.
Ventricular fibrillation;17;Doctors or paramedics can also give special medicines called anti-arrhythmic medicines, which can make the heart start beating normally again.
Ventricular fibrillation;18;Some common anti-arrhythmic medicines are amiodarone and lidocaine.
Ventricular fibrillation;19;If a person with ventricular fibrillation is treated right away, treatment is 90% successful (it works in 9 out of 10 people).
Ventricular fibrillation;20;But treatment gets 10% less successful after every minute (so if treatment starts after one minute, it will work in only 8 out of 10 people.
Ventricular fibrillation;21;After 5 minutes, it will work in only 4 out of 10 people.)
Ventricular fibrillation;22;So getting treatment as soon as possible is very important.
Ventricular fibrillation;23;If a person cannot be treated with medicine or a defibrillator right away, CPR will help keep blood and oxygen flowing through the person's body until treatment arrives.
Ventricular fibrillation;24;In patients who are very likely to keep having ventricular fibrillation, a special defibrillator can be put into their chest by a surgeon.
Ventricular fibrillation;25;"(This special defibrillator is called an "" implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. """
Ventricular fibrillation;26;) Any time the person goes into ventricular fibrillation, the defibrillator will give the person's heart an electric shock, to bring the heart back into a normal rhythm.
Tachycardia;1;Tachycardia is the fast beating of the heart.
Tachycardia;2;In adults, it refers to heart rates higher than 100 beats per minute.
Tachycardia;3;Tachycardia may be a normal physiological response to stress, but depending on the cause and how healthy the patient is, tachycardia could be harmful and need medical treatment.
Tachycardia;4;In some cases, tachycardia can cause death.
Tachycardia;5;Tachycardia can be harmful in two ways.
Tachycardia;6;First, when the heart beats too rapidly, it may perform inefficiently.
Tachycardia;7;Second, the faster the heart beats, the more oxygen and nutrients the heart requires.
Tachycardia;8;This can be especially problematic for patients suffering from ischaemic heart disease.
Pellagra;1;Pellagra is a disease caused by a lack of niacin (vitamin B3).
Pellagra;2;Niacin is found in most foods.
Pellagra;3;A person can die from pellagra if it is not treated.
Pellagra;4;"The main results of pellagra can be remembered as "" the four D's "" : diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death."
Pellagra;5;Some symptoms of pellagra according to a few sources are abdominal cramping,depression,diarrhea,headache,loss of appetite,mucus membrane inflammation,dilated cardiomyopathy.
Pellagra;6;It is also caused due to cellular deficiency of niacin, chronic alcoholism or gastro-intestinal malabsorption.
Pellagra;7;It can be prevented by adequate intake of niacin or foods rich in vitamin B3 and dietary advice to vulnerable groups.
Dermatitis;1;"Dermatitis means "" inflammation of the skin. """

Pulmonary hypertension;1;Pulmonary hypertension or PH is a condition where there is high blood pressure in the lungs.
Pulmonary hypertension;2;This condition makes it hard to breathe.
Pulmonary hypertension;3;Some people with the condition need extra oxygen.
Pulmonary hypertension;4;This condition can also make a person dizzy and become easily tired.
Pulmonary hypertension;5;Some people with the condition faint easily.
Pulmonary hypertension;6;The symptoms get worse when exercising or working hard.
Pulmonary hypertension;7;Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition, and it can be fatal.
Pulmonary hypertension;8;The condition makes it harder for the heart to pump blood.
Pulmonary hypertension;9;Because the heart has to work harder, it can also become sick.
Pulmonary hypertension;10;Some people who are very sick may need a lung transplant or a heart-lung transplant to live.
Pulmonary hypertension;11;Pulmonary hypertensions full name is pulmonary arterial hypertension even though most people call it pah, ph or pha.
Pulmonary hypertension;12;People with pulmonary hypertension have difficulty breathing.
Pulmonary hypertension;13;They also tire easily.
Pulmonary hypertension;14;Some of them faint easily too.
Pulmonary hypertension;15;They might have chest pain.
Pulmonary hypertension;16;Some patients have swelling of the feet and ankles.
Pulmonary hypertension;17;These symptoms get worse during exercise or hard work.
Pulmonary hypertension;18;Because many diseases can make it hard to breathe, a doctor must learn about the patient's background.
Pulmonary hypertension;19;This helps the doctor to treat the patient, even if the patient has another disease.
Pulmonary hypertension;20;The doctor also does several tests.
Pulmonary hypertension;21;Pulmonary hypertension makes the heart sound different.
Pulmonary hypertension;22;One test is to measure the blood pressure inside the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that goes from the heart to the lungs.
Pulmonary hypertension;23;In order to establish the cause, the physician will generally conduct a thorough medical history.
Pulmonary hypertension;24;A detailed family history is taken to determine whether the disease might be familial.
Pulmonary hypertension;25;A history of exposure to cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol leading to cirrhosis, and smoking leading to emphysema are considered significant.
Pulmonary hypertension;26;Physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension including a loud P2 (pulmonic valve closure sound), (para)sternal heave, jugular venous distension, pedal edema, ascites, hepatojugular reflux, clubbing etc.
Pulmonary hypertension;27;In pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels in the lungs become too narrow.
Pulmonary hypertension;28;The blood pressure in the lungs becomes high.
Pulmonary hypertension;29;The heart works very hard to pump blood through the narrow blood vessels.
Pulmonary hypertension;30;Later on, the blood vessels in the lungs become hard and thick.
Pulmonary hypertension;31;The heart must work harder.
Pulmonary hypertension;32;The heart can work so hard that it becomes sick.
Pulmonary hypertension;33;This is called heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension;34;The sick heart cannot pump blood well.
Pulmonary hypertension;35;Less blood goes to the lungs, so the blood gets less oxygen.
Pulmonary hypertension;36;This makes it hard to breathe.
Pulmonary hypertension;37;This gets worse when exercising or working hard.
Pulmonary hypertension;38;The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension;39;This causes pulmonary venous hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;40;This leads to pulmonary edema, or fluid build-up in the lungs.
Pulmonary hypertension;41;Many illnesses can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Pulmonary hypertension;42;Lung diseases that make the blood have less oxygen, such as:   :chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD   :interstitial lung disease   :Pickwickian syndrome   immune system problems, such as:   :AIDS   :scleroderma   :other autoimmune disorders   liver problems   :cirrhosis   :portal hypertension   other causes   :sleep apnea   :taking pills to lose weight, such as Fen-Phen, Aminorex, fenfluramine (Pondimin), and phentermine   :sickle cell disease,   :congenital heart disease   :thyroid diseases,   :taking drugs like cocaine   :possibly Human herpesvirus 8   When a person has pulmonary hypertension without any other cause, this is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or IPAH.
Pulmonary hypertension;43;When a family history exists, the disease is termed familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, (FPAH).
Pulmonary hypertension;44;IPAH and FPAH are now considered to be genetic disorders linked to mutations in the BMPR2 gene, which encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins, as well as the 5-HT(2B) gene, which codes for a serotonin receptor.
Pulmonary hypertension;45;In medicine, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery or lung vasculature, leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of which are exacerbated by exertion.
Pulmonary hypertension;46;Depending on the cause, pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and right-sided heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension;47;It was first identified by Dr Ernst von Romberg in 1891.
Pulmonary hypertension;48;It can be one of five different types, arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous.
Pulmonary hypertension;49;Although the terms primary pulmonary hypertension (meaning of unknown cause) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (meaning due to another medical condition) still persist in materials disseminated to patients and the general public, these terms have largely been abandoned in the medical literature.
Pulmonary hypertension;50;This change has occurred because the older dichotomous classification did not reflect pathophysiology or outcome.
Pulmonary hypertension;51;It led to erroneous therapeutic decisions, i.e.
Pulmonary hypertension;52;"treat "" primary "" pulmonary hypertension only."
Pulmonary hypertension;53;"This in turn led to therapeutic nihilism for many patients labeled "" secondary "" pulmonary hypertension, and could have contributed to their deaths."
Pulmonary hypertension;54;"The term "" primary pulmonary hypertension "" has now been replaced with "" idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension "" ."
Pulmonary hypertension;55;"The terms "" primary "" and "" secondary "" pulmonary hypertension should not be used any longer."
Pulmonary hypertension;56;Further details are in the Classification section below.
Pulmonary hypertension;57;The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left heart failure leading to pulmonary venous hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;58;This may be due to systolic or diastolic malfunction of the left ventricle or due to valvular dysfunction such as mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis.
Pulmonary hypertension;59;It usually manifests as pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary hypertension;60;Common causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) include HIV, scleroderma and other autoimmune disorders, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, sickle cell disease, congenital heart disease, thyroid diseases, and others.
Pulmonary hypertension;61;Use of weight loss pills such as Fen-Phen, Aminorex, fenfluramine (Pondimin), and phentermine led to the development of PAH in the past.
Pulmonary hypertension;62;Whatever the initial cause, pulmonary hypertension involves the tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs.
Pulmonary hypertension;63;This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs, much as it is harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one.
Pulmonary hypertension;64;Over time, the affected blood vessels become both stiffer and thicker, further increasing the blood pressure within the lungs and impairing blood flow.
Pulmonary hypertension;65;In addition, the increased workload of the heart causes thickening and enlargement of the right ventricle, making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs, causing right heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension;66;As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood.
Pulmonary hypertension;67;This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal.
Pulmonary hypertension;68;Therefore, it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity.
Pulmonary hypertension;69;Because pulmonary hypertension can be of 5 major types, a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thomboembolic, or miscellaneous varieties.
Pulmonary hypertension;70;A physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;71;These include altered heart sounds, such as a widely split S  or second heart sound, a loud P  or pulmonic valve closure sound (part of the second heart sound), (para)sternal heave, possible S  or third heart sound, and pulmonary regurgitation.
Pulmonary hypertension;72;Other signs include jugular venous distension (enlargement of the jugular veins), peripheral edema (swelling of the ankles and feet), ascites (abdominal swelling due to the accumulation of fluid), hepatojugular reflux, and clubbing.
Pulmonary hypertension;73;Further procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses.
Pulmonary hypertension;74;These generally include pulmonary function tests, blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest (followed by high-resolution CT scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected), and ventilation-perfusion or V/Q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;75;Biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease.
Pulmonary hypertension;76;But lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure.
Pulmonary hypertension;77;"Clinical improvement is often measured by a "" six-minute walk test "" , i.e."
Pulmonary hypertension;78;the distance a patient can walk in six minutes.
Pulmonary hypertension;79;Stability and improvement in this measurement correlate with better survival.
Pulmonary hypertension;80;Although pulmonary arterial pressure can be estimated on the basis of echocardiography, pressure sampling with a Swan-Ganz catheter provides the most definite measurement.
Pulmonary hypertension;81;PAOP and PVR can not be measured directly with echocardiography.
Pulmonary hypertension;82;Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires a cardiac catheterization.
Pulmonary hypertension;83;A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.
Pulmonary hypertension;84;"Normal pulmonary arterial pressure in a person living at sea level has a mean value of 12 & ndash;16 mm Hg (1600 & ndash;2100 Pa)."
Pulmonary hypertension;85;Definite pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pressures at rest exceed 25 mm Hg (3300 Pa).
Pulmonary hypertension;86;If mean pulmonary artery pressure rises above 30 mm Hg (4000 Pa) with exercise, that is also considered pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;87;Diagnosis of PAH requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension with two other conditions.
Pulmonary hypertension;88;Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP or PCWP) must be less than 15 mm Hg (2000 Pa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) must be greater than 3 Wood units (240 dyn•s•cm  or 2.4 mN•s•cm  ).
Pulmonary hypertension;89;In 2003, the 3rd World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension was convened in Venice to modify the classification based on the new understanding of disease mechanisms.
Pulmonary hypertension;90;The revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;91;The system includes several improvements over the former 1998 Evian Classification system.
Pulmonary hypertension;92;Risk factor descriptions were updated, and the classification of congenital systemic-to pulmonary shunts was revised.
Pulmonary hypertension;93;A new classification of genetic factors in PH was recommended, but not implemented because available data were judged to be inadequate.
Pulmonary hypertension;94;The Venice 2003 Revised Classification system can be summarized as follows:   WHO Group I - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)   WHO Group II - Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease   WHO Group III - Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxemia   WHO Group IV - Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease   WHO Group V - Miscellaneous   The terms primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PPH and SPH) were formerly used to classify the disease.
Pulmonary hypertension;95;This led to the assumption that only the primary disease should be treated, and the secondary variety should be ignored in favor of treating only the underlying illness.
Pulmonary hypertension;96;In fact all forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension are treatable.
Pulmonary hypertension;97;Unfortunately, this classification system still persists in the minds of many physicians, and probably leads to many patients with being denied treatment.
Pulmonary hypertension;98;This nihilistic approach to pulmonary arterial hypertension may also contribute to underdiagnosis.
Pulmonary hypertension;99;It is estimated that there are about 100,000 patients with PAH in the US, but only 15-20,000 have been diagnosed.
Pulmonary hypertension;100;Many others have been misdiagnosed as COPD, asthma, or congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary hypertension;101;The term primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has now been replaced with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) in much of the medical literature.
Pulmonary hypertension;102;However, some physicians continue to use the older classification inappropriately.
Pulmonary hypertension;103;IPAH is a rare disease with an incidence of about 2-3 per million per year and a prevalence of about 15 per million.
Pulmonary hypertension;104;Women are almost three times as likely to present with IPAH than men.
Pulmonary hypertension;105;Other forms of PAH are far more common.
Pulmonary hypertension;106;In scleroderma the incidence has been estimated to be 6 to 60% of all patients, in rheumatoid arthritis up to 21%, in systemic lupus erythematosus 4 to 14%, in portal hypertension between 2 and 5%, in HIV about 0.5%, and in sickle cell disease ranging from 20 to 40%.
Pulmonary hypertension;107;Diet pills such as Fen-Phen produced an annual incidence of 25-50 per million per year.
Pulmonary hypertension;108;Treatment is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous.
Pulmonary hypertension;109;Since pulmonary venous hypertension is synonymous with congestive heart failure, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, etc., or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.
Pulmonary hypertension;110;In PAH, lifestyle changes, digoxin, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, and oxygen therapy are considered conventional therapy, but have never been proven to be beneficial in a randomized, prospective manner.
Pulmonary hypertension;111;High dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter.
Pulmonary hypertension;112;Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.
Pulmonary hypertension;113;Three major pathways are involved in abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth-muscle cells of the pulmonary artery in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;114;These pathways correspond to important therapeutic targets in this condition and play a role in determining which of three classes of drugs—endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives—will be used.
Pulmonary hypertension;115;Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I  ) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH.
Pulmonary hypertension;116;Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin, marketed as Flolan®) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter.
Pulmonary hypertension;117;This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis.
Pulmonary hypertension;118;Flolan® is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration.
Pulmonary hypertension;119;Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous (24/7), and interruption can be fatal.
Pulmonary hypertension;120;Other prostanoids have therefore been developed.
Pulmonary hypertension;121;Treprostinil (Remodulin®) can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful.
Pulmonary hypertension;122;Iloprost (Ilomedin®) is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life.
Pulmonary hypertension;123;Iloprost (marketed as Ventavis®) is the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe.
Pulmonary hypertension;124;This form of administration has the advantage of selective deposition in the lungs with less systemic side effects.
Pulmonary hypertension;125;The dual (ET  and ET  ) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (marketed as Tracleer®) was approved in 2001.
Pulmonary hypertension;126;Two selective endothelin receptor antagonists (ET  only) are in the final stages of approval: sitaxsentan and ambrisentan.
Pulmonary hypertension;127;Sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), was approved for the treatment of PAH in 2005.
Pulmonary hypertension;128;It is marketed for PAH as Revatio®.
Pulmonary hypertension;129;Tadalafil (currently marketed as Cialis® for erectile dysfunction) is currently is Phase III trials.
Pulmonary hypertension;130;Vasoactive intestinal peptide by inhalation should enter clinical trials for PAH in 2007.
Pulmonary hypertension;131;PRX-08066 is a serotonin antagonist currently being developed for hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;132;Atrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria.
Pulmonary hypertension;133;It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxia).
Pulmonary hypertension;134;It is best performed in experienced centers.
Pulmonary hypertension;135;Lung transplantation cures pulmonary arterial hypertension, but leaves the patient with the complications of transplantation, and a survival of about 5 years.
Pulmonary hypertension;136;Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary hypertension;137;"It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a large and very difficult procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers."
Pulmonary hypertension;138;Case series show remarkable success in most patients.
Pulmonary hypertension;139;Treatment for hypoxic and miscellaneous varieties of pulmonary hypertension have not been established.
Pulmonary hypertension;140;However, studies of several agents are currently enrolling patients.
Pulmonary hypertension;141;Many physicians will treat these diseases with the same medications as for PAH, until better options become available.
Pulmonary hypertension;142;The NIH IPAH registry from the 1980s showed an untreated median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale).
Pulmonary hypertension;143;Although this figure is widely quoted, it is probably irrelevant today.
Pulmonary hypertension;144;Outcomes have changed dramatically over the last two decades.
Pulmonary hypertension;145;This may be because of newer drug therapy, better overall care, and earlier diagnosis (lead time bias).
Pulmonary hypertension;146;A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer®) showed that 86% patients were alive at 3 years.
Pulmonary hypertension;147;With multiple agents now available, combination therapy is increasingly used.
Pulmonary hypertension;148;Impact of these agents on survival is not known, since many of them have been developed only recently.
Pulmonary hypertension;149;It would not be unreasonable to expect median survival to extend past 10 years in the near future.

Heart failure;1;Heart failure is when the heart cannot pump blood well.
Heart failure;2;Heart failure is different from cardiac arrest, because the heart is still working.
Heart failure;3;"Heart failure can be sudden ( "" acute "" ), like after a heart attack, or can come on slowly."
Heart failure;4;Someone with heart failure can have shortness of breath (which may be worse when they lie flat), waking up breathless at night, swelling of the legs, and needing to urinate often during the night.
Heart failure;5;There are many reasons why someone can get heart failure.
Heart failure;6;Most often, heart failure is caused by heart attacks, high blood pressure, or problems with the heart valves.
Heart failure;7;A doctor makes a diagnosis of heart failure by asking about the symptoms above, and examining the heart, blood vessels, lungs, liver (for swelling) and legs (for swelling or edema).
Heart failure;8;Other tests to prove the diagnosis are X-rays of the lungs, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound test of the heart) and blood tests.
Heart failure;9;Heart failure can only be cured with a heart transplant, which is not done often, but most people with heart failure need to take diuretic medicines and other medication (ACE inhibitor, statin).
Heart failure;10;Some people with heart failure are treated with an artificial pacemaker that makes the heart work better.
Aneurysm;1;An aneurysm (or aneurism) is a blood-filled bulge of a blood vessel.
Aneurysm;2;It is usually caused by disease or by the walls of the blood vessel becoming weak.
Aneurysm;3;Aneurysms usually happen in arteries at the base of the brain and in the aorta (the main artery coming out of the heart) - this is an aortic aneurysm.
Aneurysm;4;This bulge in a blood vessel can burst or break open and cause the person to die at any time.
Aneurysm;5;The larger an aneurysm becomes, the more likely it is to burst.
Aneurysm;6;Aneurysms can be treated.
Hepatitis C;1;Hepatitis C is an infection that mostly affects the liver.
Hepatitis C;2;The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes this disease.
Hepatitis C;3;Often, a person with Hepatitis C does not have any symptoms (health problems or signs that he has the disease).
Hepatitis C;4;However, chronic infection can scar the liver.
Hepatitis C;5;Many years of infection may cause cirrhosis.
Hepatitis C;6;Sometimes, people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer.
Hepatitis C;7;They can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach.
Hepatitis C;8;The blood loss from this problem can kill.
Hepatitis C;9;Hepatitis C is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact (when blood from a person with Hepatitis C contacts (touches or gets into) another person's bloodstream).
Hepatitis C;10;"The most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use (when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins, with a needle that was already used by a person infected with Hepatitis C); nonsterile medical equipment (medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person); and blood transfusions (when a person is given blood that came from an infected person)."
Hepatitis C;11;Around the world, about 130–170 million people have Hepatitis C. Scientists began studying the Hepatitis C virus in the 1970s, and in 1989 they proved that the virus exists.
Hepatitis C;12;As far as scientists know, this virus does not cause disease in any animals other than humans.
Hepatitis C;13;The medications that are normally used to treat Hepatitis C are called peginterferon and ribavirin.
Hepatitis C;14;Between 50-80% of people who are treated (or 5 to 8 out of every 10) are cured.
Hepatitis C;15;However, if a person's Hepatitis C has progressed (or gotten worse) so much that the person has cirrhosis or liver cancer, the person might need a liver transplant (they might need to have surgery where they are given another person's liver, or part of another person's liver).
Hepatitis C;16;This makes it possible for the person to survive, but the Hepatitis C virus usually comes back after the transplant.
Hepatitis C;17;There is no vaccine that works to prevent people from getting Hepatitis C.   Hepatitis C causes acute symptoms (symptoms that begin quickly or last only a short time) in just 15% of people with the disease.
Hepatitis C;18;More often, infected people have symptoms that are mild (not serious) and vague (not very specific), like a decreased appetite (not feeling like eating), fatigue (feeling tired), nausea (feeling like throwing up), pain in the muscles or joints, and losing weight.
Hepatitis C;19;Every once in a while, an infected person may get jaundice (where a person's skin turns yellow, a sign that their liver is not working quite right).
Hepatitis C;20;If it is not treated, Hepatitis C goes away by itself in 10-50% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 10).
Hepatitis C;21;This happens more often in young women than in other infected people.
Hepatitis C;22;Eighty percent (or 8 out of every 10) of people exposed to the Hepatitis C virus get a chronic infection (one that does not get better and lasts for a long time).
Hepatitis C;23;Most experience very few or no symptoms during the first decades of the infection, although chronic Hepatitis C can cause fatigue (feeling tired).
Hepatitis C;24;But in people who have been infected for many years, Hepatitis C can cause serious problems, like cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Hepatitis C;25;Hepatitis C leads to cirrhosis in 10–30% (between 10 and 30 out of every 100) of people who have been infected over 30 years.
Hepatitis C;26;"People with Hepatitis C are more likely to get cirrhosis if they are men; if they are alcoholics; or if they also have Hepatitis B or HIV."
Hepatitis C;27;Cirrhosis can cause serious problems on its own, but it also makes people more likely to get other serious illnesses.
Hepatitis C;28;For example, people who get cirrhosis are twenty times more likely to get liver cancer (with about 1-3% getting liver cancer every year).
Hepatitis C;29;People with Hepatitis C who are alcoholics are even more likely - 100 times more likely - to get liver cancer.
Hepatitis C;30;Among people in general, 27% of all cases of cirrhosis, and 25% of all cases of liver cancer, are caused by Hepatitis C.   Cirrhosis of the liver can cause many different symptoms.
Hepatitis C;31;"Some of these symptoms are high blood pressure in the veins that travel to the liver; a buildup of fluid in the abdomen, called ascites; easy bruising or bleeding; veins becoming larger than normal, especially in the stomach and esophagus; jaundice (a yellowing of the skin); and brain damage."
Hepatitis C;32;Hepatitis C can also cause some rare problems (problems which do not happen very often), which affect parts of the body outside of the liver.
Hepatitis C;33;One rare problem that Hepatitis C can cause is Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder (or a disorder where the body's system of defenses attacks itself).
Hepatitis C;34;"Hepatitis C can also cause a lower-than-normal number of blood platelets (the part of the blood which causes blood to clot; without enough platelets, a person can have bleeding problems, or can start bleeding and be unable to stop."
Hepatitis C;35;"Other rare problems that Hepatitis C can cause are chronic (long-lasting) skin disease; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (a type of cancer); and diabetes (where a person's body does not make or use enough insulin, an important hormone that controls the level of sugar in the blood)."
Hepatitis C;36;Hepatitis C is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Hepatitis C;37;In the scientific system that names and organizes viruses, the Hepatitis C virus is part of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae.
Hepatitis C;38;"There are seven major types of HCV, called "" genotypes "" ."
Hepatitis C;39;"In the United States, the first genotype of HCV causes 70% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 7 out of every 10); the second genotype causes 20% (or 2 out of every 10); and each of the other genotypes causes 1% (or 1 out of every 100 cases)."
Hepatitis C;40;Thr first genotype is also the most common in South America and Europe.
Hepatitis C;41;In the developed world, the most common way that people get Hepatitis C is through intravenous drug use (by shooting drugs into a vein, using a needle that was already used by a person who has Hepatitis C).
Hepatitis C;42;In the developing world, most people get Hepatitis C through blood transfusions (being given blood that was taken from a person with Hepatitis C) or by getting medical care with tools that were not cleaned enough after being used on a person with Hepatitis C. In 20% of all cases of Hepatitis C (or 1 in every 5 cases), it is not known what caused the infection, but many of these cases are thought to have been caused by intravenous drug use.
Hepatitis C;43;In many parts of the world, intravenous (IV) drug use (shooting drugs into a vein using a needle) is a major risk factor for Hepatitis C (meaning that it makes people more likely to get the disease).
Hepatitis C;44;One study that looked at 77 countries showed that in 25 of these countries (including the United States), between 60% and 80% (or 6 to 8 out of every 10) of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. and China.
Hepatitis C;45;"In twelve of the countries in the study, more than 80% of all IV drug users had Hepatitis C. Across the world, as many as ten million IV drug users are thought to have Hepatitis C; the highest totals are in China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million)."
Hepatitis C;46;Studies have also shown that in places where there are high numbers of IV drug users, people are more likely to have Hepatitis C. For example, prisoners in the United States are ten to twenty times more likely than the general population (people in general) to have Hepatitis C. This is thought to be because prisoners are more likely to things that put them at high risk for getting Hepatitis C, like using IV drugs and getting tattoos with tools that have not been cleaned properly.
Hepatitis C;47;Peoples are at risk for getting Hepatitis C if they get blood transfusions (where a person is given blood from another person), blood products (which have blood or parts of blood in them), or organ transplants (where a person who needs a new organ is given an organ from another person), if these things have not been screened (or tested) for the Hepatitis C virus.
Hepatitis C;48;In the United States, there has been universal screening - meaning that all blood and organs are tested before being given to another person - since 1992.
Hepatitis C;49;"Before then, about one out of every 200 units of blood carried the Hepatitis C virus; since 1992, only one in 10,000 to 10,000,000 units of blood carry the virus."
Hepatitis C;50;The reason that there is still a low risk, instead of no risk at all, is that a person's blood does not test positive for the Hepatitis C virus until about 11–70 days after they get the disease.
Hepatitis C;51;So every once in a while, the screening tests may not pick up on a person's infection if the person got Hepatitis C less than 11–70 days before giving blood.
Hepatitis C;52;While Hepatitis C screening works very well, some countries still do not screen blood and organ donations for the disease because of the cost.
Hepatitis C;53;Sometimes, a healthcare worker will accidentally get stuck with a needle that was used on a person with Hepatitis C. If this happens, the healthcare worker has a small chance - about a 1.8% chance - of becoming infected.
Hepatitis C;54;"The worker is more likely to get infected if the needle they were stuck with was hollow, or if the needle stuck deeply into their skin It is also possible for the Hepatitis C virus to spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's blood; however, the risk of this happening is low."
Hepatitis C;55;The virus cannot be spread if an infected person's mucus touches another person's intact skin (skin that is whole and not damaged, with no wounds).
Hepatitis C;56;Hepatitis C can also be transmitted (or spread) through hospital equipment that has not been cleaned enough after being used on an infected person.
Hepatitis C;57;"Hepatitis C can be spread through needles, syringes, and medication vials (or containers) that are re-used; through infusion bags (which are used to pump medications into a person's body; and through surgical equipment that is not sterile (or clean and free of germs)."
Hepatitis C;58;In Egypt, which has the highest rate of infection in the world, medical and dental facilities with poor standards of care and cleanliness are the most common reason that Hepatitis C spreads.
Hepatitis C;59;Scientists do not know whether Hepatitis C can be transmitted (or spread) through sex.
Hepatitis C;60;Hepatitis C is more likely in people who have high-risk sexual activity (sexual actions which make them much more likely to get Hepatitis C).
Hepatitis C;61;However, it is not known whether this is because of these people's sexual behavior, or because these people were also using IV drugs.
Hepatitis C;62;"There does not seem to be any risk that Hepatitis C can be spread through sexual contact between a heterosexual couple (a man and a woman; commonly called a "" straight "" couple) if neither person has sex with anyone else."
Hepatitis C;63;"There does seem to be a risk of Hepatitis C spreading if one person already has a sexually transmitted infection, like HIV or genital ulceration; or if two people have sex in a way that causes wounds to the lining of the anal canal (like anal penetration - one person putting his penis into another person's anus)."
Hepatitis C;64;The United States government says that most people need to use condoms to protect themselves from getting Hepatitis C only if they have more than one sexual partner.
Hepatitis C;65;People who get tattoos are about two to three times more likely to get Hepatitis C. This can be because of tools that are not sterile (not clean or free of germs), or because the dyes used for tattooing are contaminated (the Hepatitis C virus has gotten inside of them).
Hepatitis C;66;Tattoos or body piercings that were done before the mid-1980s or by people who are not professionals (not experts) are especially likely to spread Hepatitis C, since they are more likely to have used tools that were not sterile.
Hepatitis C;67;"Bigger tattoos also seem to put a person at more risk of getting Hepatitis C. The risk of getting Hepatitis C is very high in prisons; in the United States, almost half of all prison inmates share tattooing tools that are not sterile."
Hepatitis C;68;However, if a tattoo is done in a licensed place of business (which has to follow rules about cleaning tools and preventing diseases from spreading), there is almost no risk of getting Hepatitis C from the tattoo.
Hepatitis C;69;Because Hepatitis C is spread by blood-to-blood contact, personal-care tools which come into contact with blood - like razors, toothbrushes, and manicure or pedicure equipment or any other kind of blood to blood contact - can spread the disease if they are shared.
Hepatitis C;70;To prevent the spread of Hepatitis C, people should be careful with cuts, sores, or anything else that causes bleeding.
Hepatitis C;71;Hepatitis C does not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils.
Hepatitis C;72;Although this does not happen very often, a pregnant woman who has Hepatitis C can give the disease to her baby when it is born, or to her fetus while she is pregnant.
Hepatitis C;73;This happens in less than 10% of all pregnancies (less than 1 out of every 10 pregnancies).
Hepatitis C;74;If a pregnant woman has Hepatitis C, nothing can be done to make her less likely to give her baby the disease.
Hepatitis C;75;If the woman is in labor (the process of delivering her baby) for a long time, there is more of a chance that the baby will become infected during the birth.
Hepatitis C;76;Breastfeeding does not seem to spread the disease.
Hepatitis C;77;However, doctors say that an infected mother should not breastfeed if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or her viral loads (the amount of the Hepatitis C virus in her blood) are high.
Hepatitis C;78;There are a few different tests that can diagnose Hepatitis C (or say for sure that a person has the disease).
Hepatitis C;79;These tests are called HCV antibody, ELISA, Western blot, and quantitative HCV RNA tests.
Hepatitis C;80;A technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can show that a person has Hepatitis C virus RNA (part of the virus's genetic blueprint) one to two weeks after the person becomes infected.
Hepatitis C;81;Tests that look for Hepatitis C antibodies (which the body makes to fight the disease) cannot be done this quickly after infection, because the antibodies can take much longer to form and show up.
Hepatitis C;82;A person has chronic Hepatitis C if he has been infected with the Hepatitis C virus for more than six months.
Hepatitis C;83;Because people with chronic Hepatitis C often have no symptoms for decades, doctors often diagnose it through liver function tests (which test how well the liver is working) or by doing routine (regular) screening of high-risk people.
Hepatitis C;84;Tests cannot tell whether an infection is acute or chronic.
Hepatitis C;85;Hepatitis C testing usually begins with blood tests that look for antibodies to the Hepatitis C virus, using a technique called an enzyme immunoassay.
Hepatitis C;86;If this test is positive (showing that the body is making antibodies to fight the Hepatitis C virus), the person will be tested a second time to make sure that the results are correct and to see how serious the infection is.
Hepatitis C;87;The results are confirmed using a technique called a recombinant immunoblot assay, and an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction shows how serious the infection is.
Hepatitis C;88;If the immunoblot is positive, but there are no Hepatitis C virus RNA, this shows that the person had an infection, but it cleared up either with treatment or on its own.
Hepatitis C;89;If the immunoblot is negative, this shows that the immunoassay (the first test) was wrong, and the person does not have Hepatitis C. It takes six to eight weeks after a person gets infected before the immunoassay will test positive.
Hepatitis C;90;"During the first part of a Hepatitis C infection, a person's liver enzymes may change; on average, they begin to rise seven weeks after infection."
Hepatitis C;91;A person's liver enzymes usually do not affect how severe their infection is.
Hepatitis C;92;A test called a liver biopsy can show whether a person's liver has been damaged, or how badly it has been damaged, by Hepatitis C. However, there are some risks from the procedure.
Hepatitis C;93;In a biopsy, a doctor takes a small piece out of the patient's liver so that he can test it.
Hepatitis C;94;There are three major changes to the liver that a biopsy usually shows.
Hepatitis C;95;One is that lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) show up in the liver tissue.
Hepatitis C;96;Another is that lymphoid follicles (small masses or swellings) show up in the portal triad, a part of the liver.
Hepatitis C;97;The third is changes to the bile ducts (these carry bile, which is made in the liver and is needed to help a person digest their food, to other parts of the body).
Hepatitis C;98;Many blood tests are available which try to measure how much damage there is to a patient's liver, in order to avoid the need for a biopsy and its risks.
Hepatitis C;99;As few as 5–50% of infected people in the United States and Canada (or 5 to 50 out of every 100) know that they have Hepatitis C. Doctors suggest that people who are at high risk for the disease, including people with tattoos, should get tested.
Hepatitis C;100;Screening is also suggested for people with elevated (high) liver enzymes, since this is often the only sign that a person has chronic hepatitis.
Hepatitis C;101;Routine screening (testing everyone) is not recommended in the United States.
Hepatitis C;102;As of 2012, there is no vaccine that works to prevent Hepatitis C. Researchers are working on vaccines, are some are making progress.
Hepatitis C;103;The spread of Hepatitis C can be prevented by using a combination of strategies, like needle exchange programs (where IV drug users can get clean needles which will not spread the virus) and treatment for drug abuse.
Hepatitis C;104;If these strategies are used together, the risk of IV drug users getting Hepatitis C drops by about 75%.
Hepatitis C;105;At a national level - within each country - screening blood donors is important for preventing the spread of Hepatitis C. So is using universal precautions in healthcare facilities.
Hepatitis C;106;(This means that healthcare workers treat every patient as if he has Hepatitis C, and they always wear gloves, clean their equipment properly, and keep things sterile so that diseases cannot be spread.)
Hepatitis C;107;In countries that do not have enough sterile syringes to use a new needle for every patient, healthcare providers should give medications orally (by mouth) rather than via injection (using a needle) so that needles do not have to be re-used.
Hepatitis C;108;The Hepatitis C virus causes chronic infection in 50–80% of infected persons (or 5 to 8 out of every 10).
Hepatitis C;109;About 40-80% of these cases (or 4 to 8 out of 10) clear up with treatment.
Hepatitis C;110;Although this almost never happens, chronic Hepatitis C can sometimes clear up on its own, without treatment.
Hepatitis C;111;Doctors suggest that people with chronic Hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and taking medications that can be toxic (or poisonous) to the liver.
Hepatitis C;112;They also suggest that people with chronic infections should be given vaccines for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.
Hepatitis C;113;People with cirrhosis should also have ultrasound tests for liver cancer.
Hepatitis C;114;If a person has liver abnormalities (changes in the liver that are not normal) due to Hepatitis C virus infection, the person should get treatment.
Hepatitis C;115;The first treatment that is used is a drug called pegylated interferon given together with the antiviral (virus-killing) drug ribavirin.
Hepatitis C;116;These medications are given for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on what type of Hepatitis C virus the person has.
Hepatitis C;117;About 50–60% of people who are treated improve.
Hepatitis C;118;For people with Hepatitis C virus genotype 1, treatment may work even better if another medication - either boceprevir or telaprevir - is given along with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa.
Hepatitis C;119;"Side effects with treatment are common; half of people treated get flu-like symptoms, and a third have emotional problems."
Hepatitis C;120;Treatment works better if it is given during the first six months than after Hepatitis C becomes chronic.
Hepatitis C;121;If a person gets a new infection and it has not cleared up after eight to twelve weeks, doctors usually suggest giving pegylated interferon for another 24 weeks.
Hepatitis C;122;For people with thalassemia (a blood disorder), ribavirin appears to be a helpful treatment, but it makes it more likely for patients to need blood transfusions (where they need to be given blood from another person).
Hepatitis C;123;Some supporters of alternative medicine say that alternative therapies like milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver can be helpful for Hepatitis C. However, there is no proof that any alternative therapy has any effect on the Hepatitis C virus.
Hepatitis C;124;People respond differently to treatment, depending on which of the Hepatitis C virus genotypes they have.
Hepatitis C;125;About 40-50% in people with genotype 1 have a good, stable response with 8–48 weeks of treatment.
Hepatitis C;126;In people with genotypes 2 and 3, about 70-80% have a good, stable response with 24 weeks of treatment.
Hepatitis C;127;About 65% of people with genotype 4 have a good, stable response with 48 weeks of treatment.
Hepatitis C;128;There is not much evidence about how well treatment works for people with genotype 6 disease is currently sparse.
Hepatitis C;129;The evidence that does exist looks at results after 48 weeks of treatment at the same medication doses as people with genotype 1.
Hepatitis C;130;Between 130 and 170 million people, or about 3% of all of the people in the world, are living with chronic Hepatitis C. Between 3–4 million people get infected per year.
Hepatitis C;131;More than 350,000 people die every year from diseases caused by Hepatitis C. The numbers of people getting Hepatitis C have increased a lot in the 20th century for a few different reasons.
Hepatitis C;132;More people are using IV drugs.
Hepatitis C;133;Also, more people are getting medical care with medical equipment that is not sterile, and it is more common for medications to be given intravenously.
Hepatitis C;134;In the United States, about 2% of people have hepatitis C, with 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year.
Hepatitis C;135;Rates have decreased in the West since the 1990s due to improved blood screening before transfusion.
Hepatitis C;136;Annual deaths from HCV in the United States range from 8,000 to 10,000.
Hepatitis C;137;Expectations are that this mortality rate will increase as people infected by transfusion before HCV testing become ill and die.
Hepatitis C;138;Infection rates are higher in some countries in Africa and Asia.
Hepatitis C;139;Countries with very high rates of infection include Egypt (22%), Pakistan (4.8%) and China (3.2%).
Hepatitis C;140;The high rate in Egypt is linked to a now-discontinued mass-treatment campaign for schistosomiasis, using improperly sterilized glass syringes.
Hepatitis C;141;In the mid-1970s, Harvey J.
Hepatitis C;142;Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his research team demonstrated that most post-blood transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or B viruses.
Hepatitis C;143;Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus failed for the next decade.
Hepatitis C;144;In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Dr. D.W. Bradley from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a new molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test.
Hepatitis C;145;In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of non A non B hepatitis specimens.
Hepatitis C;146;In April 1989, the discovery of HCV was published in two articles in the journal Science.
Hepatitis C;147;The discovery led to significant improvements in diagnosis and improved antiviral treatment.
Hepatitis C;148;In 2000, Drs.
Hepatitis C;149;"Alter and Houghton were honored with the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for   "" pioneering work leading to the discovery of the virus that causes hepatitis C and the development of screening methods that reduced the risk of blood transfusion-associated hepatitis in the U.S. from 30% in 1970 to virtually zero in 2000. """
Hepatitis C;150;Chiron filed for several patents on the virus and its diagnosis.
Hepatitis C;151;A competing patent application by the CDC was dropped in 1990 after Chiron paid $1.9 million to the CDC and $337,500 to Bradley.
Hepatitis C;152;In 1994, Bradley sued Chiron, seeking to invalidate the patent, have himself included as a coinventor, and receive damages and royalty income.
Hepatitis C;153;He dropped the suit in 1998 after losing before an appeals court.
Hepatitis C;154;The World Hepatitis Alliance coordinates World Hepatitis Day, held every year on July 28.
Hepatitis C;155;The economic costs of hepatitis C are significant both to the individual and to society.
Hepatitis C;156;In the United States the average lifetime cost of the disease was estimated at 33,407 USD in 2003, with the cost of a liver transplant approximately 200,000 USD as of 2011.
Hepatitis C;157;In Canada the cost of a course of antiviral treatment was as high as 30,000 CAD in 2003, while the United States costs are between 9,200 and 17,600 in 1998 USD.
Hepatitis C;158;In many areas of the world people are unable to afford treatment with antivirals because they lack insurance coverage or the insurance they have will not pay for antivirals.
Hepatitis C;159;As of 2011, about one hundred medications are in development for hepatitis C. These medicines include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors.
Hepatitis C;160;These potentially new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus.
Conjunctivitis;1;Conjunctivitis (also known as pinkeye) is a medical condition when the Conjunctiva (a transparent membrane that lines the outer eye, and inner part of the eyelid) becomes inflamed.

Meningitis;1;Meningitis is an infection of certain membranes and tissues of the nervous system.
Meningitis;2;Those are called meninges (singular: meninx).
Meningitis;3;Their function is to protect the central nervous system.
Meningitis;4;Most often, this infection is caused by microorganisms, like viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites.
Meningitis;5;The most common cause of meningitis are viruses, followed by bacteria.
Meningitis;6;Meningitis is a life-threatening condition.
Meningitis;7;It affects all age groups.
Meningitis;8;Some kinds of meningitis are very easy to spread.
Meningitis;9;For this reason, in certain countries, like Germany, doctors have to tell the authorities that someone might have meningitis.
Meningitis;10;"Some signs of meningitis can be: high fever, sometimes with chills; very strong headache; nauseas and vomiting; drowsiness or confusion; twitching; sleepiness; sore throat; delirium (especially in children); seizures; and stiff neck (in less than 50% of the cases, but may be a telltale sign)."
Meningitis;11;The two main forms of meningitis are bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis.
Meningitis;12;In bacterial meningitis, most patients die without treatment, whereas in viral meningitis most patients get better on their own.

Confusion;1;REDIRECT Mental confusion
Delirium;1;Delirium is a medical term.
Delirium;2;The condition is also known as acute confusional state.
Delirium;3;Doctors use it to describe patients who have lost parts or all of their ability to focus attention.
Delirium;4;People who suffer from it may also have problems to concentrate, or to remember things or other people.
Delirium;5;Delirium is a medical symptom.
Delirium;6;It is not a disease.
Delirium;7;A delirium can have many causes.
Delirium;8;The most common ones include:   Injuries to the head or the nervous system   Mental illness   Trauma or shock   Fever or pain   Certain substances found in drugs or poisons   Problems with metabolism.
Delirium;9;If a substance is transformed into another using an enzyme, a problem with that enzyme will lead to too much of the first, and too little of the second substance.
Delirium;10;Not having enough water, or food, or sleep   Withdrawal symptoms (when people try to get away from a drugs or alcohol addiction).
Delirium;11;The delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal is called delirium tremens.
Delirium;12;"There are several definitions of what constitutes a delirium, but in general, the following is true:   Disturbance of consciousness; problems to focus, shift the focus, concentrate, or shift concentration from one item to another."
Delirium;13;"hallucinations; reduced ability to solve problems."
Delirium;14;Sleeping problems are common, very often the circadian rhythm is lost.
Delirium;15;"Problems with thinking; problems remembering things."
Delirium;16;Deliria are often treated with special drugs, called antipsychotics.
Delirium;17;Deliria are always a medical emergency, because it is impossible to predict how they develop.
Delirium;18;Worst-case scenarios include cardiac arrest, and malfunctions of the metabolism.
Delirium;19;In order to be able to treat a delirium, its cause must usually be found.
Delirium;20;In the case of alcoholism, the most common cause for a delirium is the withdrawal of alcohol.
Delirium;21;This condition is known as Delirium tremens.
Jaundice;1;Jaundice (also called icterus) is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color.
Jaundice;2;People with jaundice have a problem with their liver, which stops it from removing heme properly.
Jaundice;3;Heme (from hemoglobin) changes to a chemical called bilirubin after red blood cell death.
Jaundice;4;Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin.
Jaundice;5;Jaundice is common in newly born babies.
Jaundice;6;It usually starts the second day after birth.
Jaundice;7;Jaundice can also be caused by other diseases, like malaria, hepatitis, or gallstones.
Jaundice;8;Jaundice is the most common of all liver problems.
Jaundice;9;The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood.
Jaundice;10;The bile, made by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition.
Jaundice;11;It also stops decaying changes in food.
Jaundice;12;If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products.
Jaundice;13;Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant.
Jaundice;14;There are three types of jaundice:   haemolytic jaundice - caused by destruction of red blood cells.
Jaundice;15;This causes increased bilirubin formation and anaemia   obstructive jaundice - caused by a blockage in the pathway where bilirubin is made in the liver cells and where bile goes into the duodenum   hepatocellular jaundice - caused by damage to liver cells.
Jaundice;16;The damage could be from a viral infection or toxic drugs.
Jaundice;17;Yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes happens in all types of jaundice.
Jaundice;18;The symptoms of jaundice are:   extreme weakness   headache   fever   loss of appetite   tiredness   severe constipation   nausea   yellow coloration of the eyes, tongue, skin and urine.
Jaundice;19;dull pain in the liver region.
Jaundice;20;Obstructive jaundice may also cause intense itching.
Jaundice;21;Jaundice is a sign that the liver is not working.
Jaundice;22;It may be caused by a blockage of the bile ducts which release bile salts and pigment into the intestines.
Jaundice;23;The bile then gets mixed with blood and this gives a yellow colour to the skin.
Jaundice;24;The blockage of the bile ducts could be caused by:   gallstones   inflammation (swelling) of the liver, called hepatitis.
Jaundice;25;This is caused by a virus.
Jaundice;26;The virus can spread and may lead to epidemics caused by:   overcrowding   dirty surroundings   insanitary conditions   contamination of food and water.
Jaundice;27;Other causes of jaundice are pernicious anaemia and diseases affecting the liver such as typhoid, malaria, yellow fever and tuberculosis.
Coma;1;Coma is a medical term.
Coma;2;It is a state of deep unconsciousness.
Coma;3;People who are in that state cannot be woken up.
Coma;4;They also do not react to pain or light.
Coma;5;Coma can result from various conditions.
Coma;6;Some of these are intoxication, poisons, damages or diseases of the nervous system.
Coma;7;It can also be the result of certain drugs.
Coma;8;Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma.
Coma;9;There are different levels of coma.
Coma;10;Comas usually do not last more than several weeks, but those several weeks could be disastrous.
Coma;11;Sometimes only basic bodily functions are left over.
Coma;12;Intensive hospital care is often needed to recover some of these functions.
Coma;13;Some comas can last years, but these are usually not woken up from.
Coma;14;The family of a coma victim (or whoever has the power of attorney) can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and die.

Nausea;1;Nausea is a general feeling of unease and discomfort in the stomach, often with the urge to vomit.
Nausea;2;The word nausea comes from the Latin word for seasickness.
Nausea;3;Nausea is a symptom, rather than an illness or disease.
Nausea;4;The causes for it very often are not in the stomach itself, but somewhere else in the body.
Nausea;5;Nausea is often caused by a stomach virus.
Nausea;6;Nausea is usually harmless, in the short term.
Nausea;7;A good treatment for it can be not to take solid food (and to only drink non-alcoholic drinks, like water).
Nausea;8;Nausea can also occur during pregnancy, and is quite normal in that context.
Nausea;9;People can suffer nausea without vomiting.
Tetanus;1;Tetanus is a disease that leads to muscle contractions that stay that way for some time.
Tetanus;2;Infection generally occurs through wound contamination, and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound.
Tetanus;3;The primary symptoms are caused by tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani.
Tetanus;4;As the infection goes on, muscle spasms develop in the jaw.
Tetanus;5;This led to the common name of the condition, lockjaw.
Tetanus;6;This is usually followed by difficulties with swallowing.
Tetanus;7;The condition leads to general muscle stiffness and spasms in other parts of the body.
Tetanus;8;Infection can be prevented by proper immunization and by post-exposure prophylaxis.

Paralysis;1;Paralysis is the complete loss of muscle function for one or more muscle groups, when the thing that is paralysed cannot move.
Paralysis;2;Paralysis is most often caused by damage to the nervous system or brain, especially the spinal cord.
Paralysis;3;Major causes are stroke, trauma, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), botulism, spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Paralysis;4;Partial paralysis can also occur in the REM stage of sleep (see:Sleep paralysis).
Paralysis;5;Paralysis often includes loss of feeling in the affected area.
Leptospirosis;1;Leptospirosis (also known as Weil's disease, canicola fever, canefield fever, nanukayami fever or seven day fever) is a bacterial disease.
Leptospirosis;2;It is caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira.
Leptospirosis;3;This bacterium affects humans and many animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles.
Leptospirosis;4;It was first described by Adolf Weil in 1886.
Leptospirosis;5;"At the time he reported an "" acute infectious disease with enlargement of spleen, jaundice and nephritis "" ."
Leptospirosis;6;The pathogen, Leptospira-genus bacteria was isolated in 1907 from a post mortem kidney slice.
Leptospirosis;7;Leptospirosis is a relatively rare bacterial infection in humans.
Leptospirosis;8;The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing fresh water that has been contaminated by animal urine (often from rats) to come in contact with the skin, eyes or with the mucous membranes.
Leptospirosis;9;It usually causes heart failure, kidney failure or liver failure, and most sufferers die if they are not treated urgently.
Leptospirosis;10;The disease causes little concern, as it is quite rare   Except for tropical areas, Leptospirosis seems to occur most often in the months August to September, in the Northern Hemisphere.

Diabetes insipidus;1;Diabetes insipidus is a medical condition caused when vasopressin does not appear in a person's blood.
Diabetes insipidus;2;Vasopressin is released from the brain, and travels in the blood to the kidneys.
Diabetes insipidus;3;There, it pulls water out of the urine, which reduces the amount of urine stored in the bladder.
Diabetes insipidus;4;If there is no vasopressin in the blood, the kidneys leave the water in the urine, and the bladder holds more liquid.
Diabetes insipidus;5;This means a person needs to urinate more often.
Diabetes insipidus;6;It also causes thirst.
Diabetes insipidus;7;Increased thirst and urination are symptoms of regular diabetes (diabetes mellitus).
Diabetes insipidus;8;"That's why diabetes insipidus shares the name "" diabetes. """
Diabetes insipidus;9;Diabetes mellitus
Metastasis;1;Metastasis is what happens when cancer spreads from its original place to another part of the body.
Metastasis;2;Cancer cells spread from the original site to other places in the body by traveling through the bloodstream.
Metastasis;3;When the cancer cells stick to a new place in the body, they grow and form another tumor there.
Metastasis;4;Metastasis makes cures more difficult, or in many cases impossible.
Hyperthyroidism;1;Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition.
Hyperthyroidism;2;It is caused by a thyroid gland that is too active.
Hyperthyroidism;3;The thyroid gland makes hormones.
Hyperthyroidism;4;These hormones manage the body’s metabolism.
Hyperthyroidism;5;An example of one of these hormones is thyroxine.
Hyperthyroidism;6;The thyroid-stimulating hormone starts the making of thyroxine.
Hyperthyroidism;7;The thyroid-stimulating hormone is also called “TSH.” TSH is made in the pituitary gland.
Hyperthyroidism;8;Hyperthyroidism is determined by a doctor by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.
Hyperthyroidism;9;"The most common cause of this disorder is "" Graves’ disease.” Graves’ disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes overactive."
Hyperthyroidism;10;Antibodies from the immune system in the bloodstream attack itself (this is called an autoimmune disease).
Hyperthyroidism;11;This causes the thyroid gland to grow, as well as produce more thyroid hormones.
Hyperthyroidism;12;Some symptoms of this disorder are the swelling of the neck, as well as weight loss.
Hyperthyroidism;13;In addition, patients could experience their hands trembling, as well as their blood pressure increasing.
Hyperthyroidism;14;They could also experience nervousness and anxiety attacks.
Hyperthyroidism;15;Medication can stop the effects of hyperthyroidism.
Hyperthyroidism;16;However, hyperthyroidism cannot be fixed completely.
Hyperthyroidism;17;Hyperthyroidism can occasionally cause death.
Alcoholism;1;Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol.
Alcoholism;2;People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics.
Alcoholism;3;Alcoholism is a disease.
Alcoholism;4;It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person.
Alcoholism;5;However, alcoholism can be treated.
Alcoholism;6;Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world.
Alcoholism;7;Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism.
Alcoholism;8;Alcoholism is a condition with a social stigma.
Alcoholism;9;Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking.
Alcoholism;10;They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed.
Alcoholism;11;Being an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol.
Alcoholism;12;It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink.
Alcoholism;13;No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking.
Alcoholism;14;To be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:   They feel like they have to drink alcohol.
Alcoholism;15;They cannot control when they start.
Alcoholism;16;"drinking; when they stop drinking; or how much they drink."
Alcoholism;17;They get alcohol withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking.
Alcoholism;18;They have to drink more and more alcohol to feel drunk (this is called tolerance).
Alcoholism;19;They spend less time doing things they used to enjoy, because they are spending so much time drinking.
Alcoholism;20;They spend a lot of time getting alcohol, drinking alcohol, or feeling sick from drinking too much.
Alcoholism;21;They keep drinking even though they know it is causing serious problems in their life.
Alcoholism;22;There is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic.
Alcoholism;23;There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person may be an alcoholic.
Alcoholism;24;These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers).
Alcoholism;25;Alcoholism can cause many health problems.
Alcoholism;26;"For example, it can cause:   Brain damage   Liver disease (like cirrhosis) and liver failure   Many types of cancer, including mouth, throat, esophageal, breast, and liver cancers   Heart problems, including a weak heart muscle; abnormal heartbeat; high blood pressure; and stroke   Problems with the pancreas   A weak immune system, which makes it harder for the body to fight off diseases   Depression and anxiety   Deaths from drunk driving accidents or other injuries   If a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning."
Alcoholism;27;This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death.
Alcoholism;28;In 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world.
Alcoholism;29;This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use.
Alcoholism;30;Alcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives.
Alcoholism;31;These include:   Not doing well at school or work   Having family problems   Not having enough money, because the alcoholic is spending so much money on alcohol   Being unemployed   Abusing or neglecting their children   Abusing their wives or husbands   Living in poverty or being homeless   If an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal.
Alcoholism;32;"The most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called "" DTs "" )."
Alcoholism;33;Delirium tremens is a medical emergency.
Alcoholism;34;Many people who get the DTs die from them.
Alcoholism;35;This does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking.
Alcoholism;36;It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking.
Alcoholism;37;Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.
Alcoholism;38;In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world.
Alcoholism;39;(This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.)
Alcoholism;40;In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world.
Alcoholism;41;This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics.
Alcoholism;42;People in developed countries drink the most alcohol.
Alcoholism;43;Alcoholism is more common in some areas than others.
Alcoholism;44;Here is a list of all the areas in the world.
Alcoholism;45;It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common:    The European area   The Americas   The Western Pacific area (including China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and many islands in the Pacific Ocean)   The Southeast Asian area   Africa   The Eastern Mediterranean area (including the Middle East and northeast Africa)   There are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others.
Alcoholism;46;Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking.
Alcoholism;47;For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.
Alcoholism;48;These are areas where many people are Muslims.
Alcoholism;49;Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.
Alcoholism;50;In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal.
Alcoholism;51;However, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life.
Alcoholism;52;It is legal and easy to get.
Alcoholism;53;People very commonly drink alcohol with meals.
Alcoholism;54;Very few people drink no alcohol.
Alcoholism;55;People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries.
Alcoholism;56;This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas.
Alcoholism;57;Alcoholism is more common in men than in women.
Alcoholism;58;However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased.
Alcoholism;59;Female alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe.
Alcoholism;60;In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives.
Alcoholism;61;In the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics.
Alcoholism;62;In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.
Alcoholism;63;In many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol.
Alcoholism;64;In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries.
Alcoholism;65;Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.
Alcoholism;66;Alcoholism can be treated.
Alcoholism;67;There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.
Alcoholism;68;"Detoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. """
Alcoholism;69;"Detoxification "" means "" getting toxins out of the body. """
Alcoholism;70;Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body.
Alcoholism;71;The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more.
Alcoholism;72;It is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own.
Alcoholism;73;The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification.
Alcoholism;74;"These hospitals are often called "" detoxes "" or "" rehabs. """
Alcoholism;75;These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox.
Alcoholism;76;They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
Alcoholism;77;The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.
Alcoholism;78;Once a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called sober.
Alcoholism;79;Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober.
Alcoholism;80;Psychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober.
Alcoholism;81;For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to:   Deal with stress without using alcohol   Figure out what makes them want to drink, and learn how to deal with those things without drinking   Plan what they will do if they are around people who are drinking   Come up with reasons for why they want to stay sober, and use those things as motivation to stay sober (this is called Motivational Interviewing)   Change their thoughts about drinking and how they react to those thoughts (this is called Cognitive-behavioral therapy)   Some medications can help alcoholics stay sober.
Alcoholism;82;These medications include:    Antabuse: This medication makes a person very sick if they drink any alcohol.
Alcoholism;83;It can make an alcoholic not want to drink any more, because they do not want to get sick.
Alcoholism;84;Naltrexone: This medication causes changes in the brain.
Alcoholism;85;These changes make alcoholics not want to drink alcohol as much as they normally do.
Alcoholism;86;Also, if an alcoholic does drink alcohol, the naltrexone will block the alcohol from making them feel good, and they are more likely to stop drinking.
Alcoholism;87;Many alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body.
Alcoholism;88;This can cause serious problems.
Alcoholism;89;For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage.
Alcoholism;90;Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage.
Alcoholism;91;They may also be given other vitamins if needed.
Alcoholism;92;Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world.
Alcoholism;93;This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover.
Alcoholism;94;AA uses a twelve-step program.
Alcoholism;95;This program is meant to help alcoholics fix the problems their alcoholism has caused.
Alcoholism;96;There are also other groups for alcoholics, like:   SMART Recovery   Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)   Women for Sobriety   LifeRing Secular Recovery   Celebrate Recovery (based on Christianity and the Bible)   Addiction   Drunkenness   Fetal alcohol syndrome   CIWA scale (used to measure how bad alcohol withdrawal is)   CAGE questionnaire (used to test adults for alcoholism)   CRAFFT Screening Test (used to test teenagers for alcohol and drug problems)   Fact sheets about alcohol (from the United States Centers for Disease Control)   Information about alcohol for kids (from KidsHealth.org)   Information about alcohol for teenagers (from GirlsHealth.gov)   National Substance Abuse Hotline - find help for alcoholism, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (run by SAMHSA.gov)   Treatment for Alcohol Problems: Finding and Getting Help (by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism)   Groups for alcoholics and their families   Alcoholics Anonymous   Al-Anon (support group for people who have an alcoholic family member)   Alateen (support group for teenagers who have an alcoholic family member)   SMART Recovery   Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)   Women for Sobriety   LifeRing Secular Recovery   Celebrate Recovery
Sprain;1;A sprain is a type of injury in which a person hurts the part really bad, but it is not broken.
Sprain;2;It has common side affects of a broken bone, but it is less serious.
Sprain;3;The first degree is only a minor tear or stretch of a ligament.
Sprain;4;The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling.
Sprain;5;The third degree is a complete rupture.
Sprain;6;The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation:   localized pain   swelling   loss of function   Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:   the ankle.
Sprain;7;It is the most common.
Sprain;8;the knee.
Sprain;9;Perhaps one of the more talked about sprains is that to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.
Sprain;10;This is a disabling sprain common to athletes, especially basketball, soccer, and judo players.
Sprain;11;the fingers.
Sprain;12;the wrist.
Sprain;13;The wrist is also a popular sprain area.
Sprain;14;Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility.
Sprain;15;Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains.

Cardiomyopathy;1;"The word cardiomyopathy means "" heart muscle disease "" ."
Cardiomyopathy;2;Cardiomyopathies are a group of diseases in which the function of the myocardium (heart muscle) is impaired for any reason.
Cardiomyopathy;3;People with cardiomyopathy are often at risk of arrhythmia and/or sudden cardiac death.
Cardiomyopathy;4;There are four main types of cardiomyopathy:   Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form.
Cardiomyopathy;5;Patients with this disease usually undergo heart transplantation.
Cardiomyopathy;6;In DCM the heart (especially the left ventricle) is enlarged and the pumping function is impaired.
Cardiomyopathy;7;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM or HOCM) is a genetic disorder in which the heart muscle is thickened, which can block blood flow and prevent the heart from functioning properly.
Cardiomyopathy;8;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is caused by an electrical disturbance of the heart in which heart muscle is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.
Cardiomyopathy;9;The right ventricle is generally most affected.
Cardiomyopathy;10;Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least common cardiomyopathy.
Cardiomyopathy;11;The walls of the ventricles are stiff, but may not be thickened, and resist the normal filling of the heart with blood.
Common cold;1;The common cold (also known as nasopharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, acute coryza, or a cold) is an easily spread infectious disease of the upper respiratory system.
Common cold;2;It damages mostly the nose and throat.
Common cold;3;The symptoms include cough, painful throat, runny nose (rhinorrhea), and fever.
Common cold;4;These symptoms usually last seven to ten days, but sometimes up to three weeks.
Common cold;5;Over two hundred different viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common cause.
Common cold;6;Acute infections of the nose, sinuses, throat or larynx (upper respiratory tract infections, URI or URTI) are sorted by the areas of the body that are mostly hurt.
Common cold;7;The common cold mostly hurts the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and sinusitis the sinuses.
Common cold;8;The symptoms come from the immune system's response to the infection, not from direct destruction by the viruses themselves.
Common cold;9;Hand washing is the main way to keep the common cold from happening.
Common cold;10;Wearing face masks might also help.
Common cold;11;There is no cure for the common cold, but the symptoms can be treated.
Common cold;12;It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans.
Common cold;13;The average person gets two to three colds every year.
Common cold;14;The average child gets between 6 and 12 colds every year.
Common cold;15;These colds have been with humans for thousands of years.
Common cold;16;The most common symptoms of a cold are a cough, runny nose, a stuffy nose, and a sore throat.
Common cold;17;Other issues are sore muscles, feeling tired, headache, and not wanting to eat.
Common cold;18;Around 40% of people with colds have a sore throat, while around 50% have a cough.
Common cold;19;Muscle ache happens in about half of the cases.
Common cold;20;A fever is an uncommon symptom in adults, but it is common in infants and young children.
Common cold;21;The cough caused by a cold is usually mild compared to a cough caused by influenza (the flu).
Common cold;22;A cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of the flu in adults.
Common cold;23;A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in no symptoms.
Common cold;24;The color of the mucus that is coughed up from the lower airways (sputum) may vary in color from clear to yellow to green.
Common cold;25;This color does not indicate if an infection is caused by viruses or bacteria.
Common cold;26;A cold usually begins with feeling tired, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache.
Common cold;27;Additional symptoms such as runny nose and cough follow within two or more days.
Common cold;28;Symptoms typically reach their worst two to three days after the infection begins.
Common cold;29;Symptoms usually end after seven to ten days, but can last up to three weeks.
Common cold;30;The cough lasts for more than ten days in 35% to 40% of cases involving children.
Common cold;31;It lasts for more than 25 days in 10% of cases involving children.
Common cold;32;The common cold is an easily spread infection of the upper respiratory tract.
Common cold;33;The rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold.
Common cold;34;It accounts for 30% to 80% of all cases.
Common cold;35;A rhinovirus is an RNA-containing virus of the family Picornaviridae.
Common cold;36;There are 99 known types of viruses in this family of viruses.
Common cold;37;Other viruses can also cause the common cold.
Common cold;38;The Coronavirus causes 10% to 15% of cases.
Common cold;39;The flu causes 5% to 15% of cases.
Common cold;40;Other cases may be caused by human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, Enteroviruses, and metapneumovirus.
Common cold;41;Frequently, more than one virus is present and causing the infection.
Common cold;42;In total, over two hundred different viruses[k2] are associated with colds.
Common cold;43;The common cold virus is usually spread in one of two main ways.
Common cold;44;"By breathing or swallowing droplets in the air containing the virus; or by contacting infected nasal mucus or contaminated objects."
Common cold;45;The most common method of transmitting the cold virus has not been determined.
Common cold;46;The viruses may survive for a long time in the environment.
Common cold;47;Viruses may then be transmitted from the hands to the eyes or nose where infection occurs.
Common cold;48;People sitting close together appear at greater risk of becoming infected.
Common cold;49;Transmission is common in day cares and at schools, due to the closeness of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene.
Common cold;50;These infections are then brought home to other members of the family.
Common cold;51;There is no evidence that the air on commercial flights transmits cold viruses.
Common cold;52;Rhinoviruses are most infectious in the first three days of cold symptoms.
Common cold;53;They are much less infectious afterwards.
Common cold;54;The traditional theory was that the disease spread to someone staying too long in cold weather, rain, or winter conditions.
Common cold;55;This is how the disease got its name.
Common cold;56;The role of body cooling as a risk factor for the common cold is controversial.
Common cold;57;Some common cold viruses are seasonal, found more often in cold or wet weather.
Common cold;58;"This is believed to mostly be due to more time spent indoors, close to each other; specifically children returning to school."
Common cold;59;Still, changes in the respiratory system may result in easier infections.
Common cold;60;Dry air may increase transmission rates by allowing small easily spread droplets to spread farther and stay in the air longer.
Common cold;61;Herd immunity, immunity that occurs when an entire group of people become immune to a particular infection, occurs from previous exposure to cold viruses.
Common cold;62;Thus younger populations have greater rates of respiratory infections and older populations have lower rates of respiratory infections.
Common cold;63;Poor immune function is also a risk factor for disease.
Common cold;64;Lack of sleep and poor nutrition have also been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure.
Common cold;65;This is believed to be due to their effects on immune function.
Common cold;66;The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be mostly related to the immune response to the virus.
Common cold;67;The mechanism of this immune response is virus-specific.
Common cold;68;For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact.
Common cold;69;It binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown methods to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators.
Common cold;70;These inflammatory mediators then produce the symptoms.
Common cold;71;It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium.
Common cold;72;In contrast, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is contacted by both direct contact and airborne droplets.
Common cold;73;It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract.
Common cold;74;RSV does cause epithelium damage.
Common cold;75;Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and airways.
Common cold;76;In young children, when it affects the trachea it may produce croup, a hoarse cough and difficulty breathing.
Common cold;77;This is due to the small size of the airway in children.
Common cold;78;The distinction between different upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is loosely based on the location of the symptoms.
Common cold;79;The common cold primarily affects the nose, pharyngitis primarily affects the throat, and bronchitis primarily affects the lungs.
Common cold;80;The common cold is frequently defined as inflammation of the nose and may include varying amounts of throat inflammation.
Common cold;81;Self-diagnosis is common.
Common cold;82;Isolation of the actual viral agent involved is rarely performed.
Common cold;83;It is generally not possible to identify the specific virus through symptoms.
Common cold;84;The only effective way to prevent the common cold is by physically preventing the spread of the viruses.
Common cold;85;This primarily includes hand washing and wearing face masks.
Common cold;86;In the health care environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also worn.
Common cold;87;Isolating infected individuals is not possible because the disease is so widespread and symptoms are not specific.
Common cold;88;Vaccination has proved difficult because there are so many viruses involved and the viruses undergo rapid change.
Common cold;89;Developing a broadly effective vaccine is very unlikely.
Common cold;90;Regular hand washing reduces the spread of cold viruses.
Common cold;91;It is most effective and is especially recommended for use in children, due to a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of over-the-counter cold medicines for children, and due to the risk for harm from those medicines.
Common cold;92;In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years old and younger due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits.
Common cold;93;The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries.
Common cold;94;In adults, the symptoms of a runny nose can be reduced by first-generation antihistamines.
Common cold;95;However, first-generation antihistamines are associated with adverse side effects such as drowsiness.
Common cold;96;Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine are also effective in adults.
Common cold;97;Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose, but there is little effect on stuffiness.
Common cold;98;Second-generation antihistamines do not appear to be effective.
Common cold;99;Due to the lack of studies, it is not known whether drinking more fluids improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness.
Common cold;100;A similar lack of data exists for the use of heated humidified air.
Common cold;101;One study found chest vapor rub to be effective in providing some symptomatic relief of night-time cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.
Common cold;102;Antibiotics have no effect against viral infections and thus have no effect against the common cold.
Common cold;103;Antibiotics are often prescribed even though antibiotic side effects cause overall harm.
Common cold;104;Antibiotics are commonly prescribed because people expect doctors to prescribe them, and doctors want to help people.
Common cold;105;Prescribing antibiotics also happens because it is difficult to exclude causes of infection that may be managed by antibiotics.
Common cold;106;There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold, even though some preliminary research has shown benefit.
Common cold;107;While there are many alternative treatments used for the common cold, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of most treatments.
Common cold;108;As of 2010, there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against either honey or nasal irrigation.
Common cold;109;Zinc supplements may reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when taken within 24 hours of their onset.
Common cold;110;The effect of vitamin C on the common cold, while extensively researched, is disappointing.
Common cold;111;Evidence about the usefulness of echinacea is inconsistent.
Common cold;112;Different types of echinacea supplements may vary in their effectiveness.
Common cold;113;The common cold is generally mild and goes away on its own with most symptoms improving in one week.
Common cold;114;Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system).
Common cold;115;Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection.
Common cold;116;It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% of cases.
Common cold;117;Ear infections occur in 30% of cases.
Common cold;118;The common cold is the most common human disease and people are affected all around the world.
Common cold;119;Adults typically have two to five infections per year.
Common cold;120;Children may have six to ten colds per year (and up to twelve colds per year for school children).
Common cold;121;Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to a weakening immune system.
Common cold;122;While the cause of the common cold has been known since only the 1950s, the disease has been with humanity since ancient times.
Common cold;123;Its symptoms and treatment are described in the Egyptian Ebers papyrus, the oldest existing medical text, written before the 16th century BC.
Common cold;124;"The name "" common cold "" came into use in the 16th century, due to the similarity between its symptoms and those of exposure to cold weather."
Common cold;125;In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit (CCU) was set up by the Medical Research Council in 1946, and it was here that the rhinovirus was discovered in 1956.
Common cold;126;In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection provided some protection against the disease.
Common cold;127;No practical treatment could be developed.
Common cold;128;The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds.
Common cold;129;Zinc was the only successful treatment developed in the history of the CCU.
Common cold;130;The economic impact of the common cold is poorly understood in much of the world.
Common cold;131;In the United States, the common cold leads to 75 million to 100 million physician visits annually, costing at least $7.7 billion per year (by conservative cost estimates).
Common cold;132;Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.
Common cold;133;Americans spend an additional $400 million on prescription medicines for symptomatic relief.
Common cold;134;More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription.
Common cold;135;The use of antibiotic prescriptions has implications for antibiotic resistance.
Common cold;136;An estimated 22 million to 189 million school days are missed each year due to a cold.
Common cold;137;As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children.
Common cold;138;When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total economic impact of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year.
Common cold;139;This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.
Common cold;140;A number of antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold.
Common cold;141;As of 2009, none have been both found effective and licensed for use.
Common cold;142;There are ongoing trials of the antiviral drug pleconaril.
Common cold;143;It shows promise against picornaviruses.
Common cold;144;There are also ongoing trials of BTA-798.
Common cold;145;The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied.
Common cold;146;Researchers from the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Wisconsin–Madison have mapped the genome for all known virus strains that cause the common cold.

Breast cancer;1;Breast cancer is cancer in the breast.
Breast cancer;2;In the world, breast cancer is the fifth-most common cause of cancer death.
Breast cancer;3;The first four are lung cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and colon cancer.
Breast cancer;4;"In 2005, breast cancer caused 502,000 deaths (7% of cancer deaths; almost 1% of all deaths) in the world."
Breast cancer;5;Among all women in the world, breast cancer is the most common cancer.
Breast cancer;6;In the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and the second most common cause of cancer death in women (after lung cancer).
Breast cancer;7;"In 2007, breast cancer caused about 40,910 deaths (7% of cancer deaths; almost 2% of all deaths) in the U.S. Women in the United States have a 1 in 8 chance of getting breast cancer in their lives."
Breast cancer;8;They have a 1 in 33 chance of death from breast cancer.
Breast cancer;9;There are many more people getting breast cancer since the 1970s.
Breast cancer;10;This is because of how people in the Western world live.
Breast cancer;11;Because the breast is composed of identical tissues in males and females, breast cancer also occurs in males, though it is less common.
Breast cancer;12;When a person gets breast cancer, they can try to cure it in three ways.
Breast cancer;13;Doctors can cut out the cancer (mastectomy or lumpectomy).
Breast cancer;14;They can give the person drugs (chemotherapy).
Breast cancer;15;They can also try to kill the cancer with energy (radiation).
Breast cancer;16;If one cure does not work, they may need to try another.
Cataplexy;1;Cataplexy is a medical condition where people become limp when they are exposed to spontaneous emotions such as laughter, fright, anger, or sadness.
Cataplexy;2;People who have cataplexy will sometimes see that some of their muscles suddenly fail them.
Cataplexy;3;Cataplexy often affects people who have narcolepsy.
Cataplexy;4;Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder.
Cataplexy;5;People with narcolepsy tend to suddenly fall asleep.
Cataplexy;6;They cannot control when they fall asleep.
Cataplexy;7;Cataplexy is sometimes confused with epilepsy, where a series of flashes or other stimuli cause superficially similar seizures.
Cataplexy;8;The term Cataplexy originates from the Greek kata, meaning down, and plexis, meaning a stroke or seizure.
Hepatitis A;1;Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus.
Hepatitis A;2;Unlike the other common forms of hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), it does not cause chronic (long-term) liver disease.
Hepatitis A;3;When a person has hepatitis A, the virus stays in their feces.
Hepatitis A;4;Hepatitis A is usually spread by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with infected feces.
Hepatitis A;5;For example, hepatitis A can be spread by:   Using ice that was made from contaminated water   Eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods that are not cooked, which may have gotten contaminated when a person with hepatitis A prepared them   Foods that are not cooked are more likely to spread hepatitis A because cooking food will kill the virus   Eating shellfish that lived in contaminated water, and were not cooked well enough to kill the virus   Hepatitis A can also be spread by having sex with someone who has hepatitis A.   Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)   Abdominal pain   Fever   Nausea and Vomiting   Fatigue   Anorexia (loss of the desire to eat)   There is no medication that can cure hepatitis A.
Hepatitis A;6;In most cases, the infection resolves on its own.
Hepatitis A;7;In most cases, symptoms last less than 2 months, although some people are sick for as long as six months.
Hepatitis A;8;Unfortunately, a small number of patients develop Fulminant hepatic failure, which is very serious.
Hepatitis A;9;A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A, and anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin is also used.
Hepatitis B;1;Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver.
Hepatitis B;2;It is caused by a virus.
Hepatitis B;3;The virus is not spread by food or casual contact.
Hepatitis B;4;It can be spread by blood or body fluids from an infected person.
Hepatitis B;5;A baby can get it from its mother during childbirth.
Hepatitis B;6;It can also be spread by sexual contact, reuse of needles, and transfusions of blood with the virus in it.
Hepatitis B;7;Infection with hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, where an injection is given which makes the body immune to the virus.
Hepatitis B;8;It is recommended that all people are given a series of three vaccines over a few months when they are babies to ensure good protection against this virus.
Hepatitis B;9;However, vaccination only provides 90% protection, it does not completely remove the risk of infection.
Hepatitis B;10;Some people who are infected are able to beat the virus quickly.
Hepatitis B;11;Many people are infected for life.
Hepatitis B;12;Usually they have few or no symptoms.
Hepatitis B;13;Sometimes the liver is damaged severely, causing liver failure.
Hepatitis B;14;A common symptom of liver failure is jaundice, where the person's skin and eyes turn yellow due to a build-up of body products which would normally be filtered by the liver.
Hepatitis B;15;Another problem with hepatitis B is that it can cause cancer of the liver.
Hepatitis B;16;Blood tests can find signs that the liver is being damaged.
Hepatitis B;17;If people have those signs, treatment for hepatitis B can prevent the liver damage caused by the virus.
Hepatitis B;18;Antiviral medications are given, which prevent the virus from making copies of itself.
Hepatitis B;19;However, once the virus is in the liver, it is not possible to get rid of the virus completely.
Gastroenteritis;1;Gastroenteritis is a medical term for inflammation of the stomach and intestines.
Gastroenteritis;2;It causes diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain.
Gastroenteritis;3;It usually happens because of infection by a virus or bacteria.
Gastroenteritis;4;Other common terms for gastroenteritis include infectious diarrhea, stomach bug, and stomach virus.
Gastroenteritis;5;It is sometimes called stomach flu or gastric flu, but it is not related to the influenza virus (which is often shortened to 'flu').
Haemophilia;1;Haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop.
Haemophilia;2;The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot.
Haemophilia;3;People with hemophilia lack proteins in the blood that make scabs and blood clots.
Haemophilia;4;A person with a small cut or internal bleed (bruise) could bleed to death.
Haemophilia;5;They do not bleed more than a normal person, but they bleed for much longer.
Haemophilia;6;"The word comes from the Greek words haima ( "" blood "" ) and philia ( "" to love "" )."
Haemophilia;7;To treat this, an affected person can get a blood donation from someone without hemophilia.
Haemophilia;8;The donor’s blood has the clotting proteins and can temporarily make a normal scab.
Haemophilia;9;30% of hemophilia A and B cases are the first person in their family to have hemophilia which is the result of an unexpected mutation (this means that there is an unexpected change in the body).
Haemophilia;10;It usually affects males.
Haemophilia;11;It is passed from mother to child through genes.
Haemophilia;12;There are 3 types of haemophilia:   Haemophilia A - about 90% of cases.
Haemophilia;13;There is no blood clotting ability.
Haemophilia;14;Haemophilia B - not as severe, but much less common.
Haemophilia;15;There is not enough blood clotting ability.
Haemophilia;16;Haemophilia C - caused by not one, but two recessive (weak) genes.
Haemophilia;17;Haemophilia A happens in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 male births.
Haemophilia;18;Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 20,000–34,000 male births.
Haemophilia;19;Genetic defects on the X chromosome affect males because they have only one X chromosome.
Haemophilia;20;In females, a recessive gene is usually masked by a normal gene on the other X chromosome.
Haemophilia;21;The Y chromosome does carry some genes, but far fewer than the X chromosome.
Haemophilia;22;"Defects of this type are called "" sex-linked "" in genetics."
Haemophilia;23;There is no cure for this disease but there are different treatments available around the world.
Haemophilia;24;A person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac.
Haemophilia;25;Nicholas II of Russia
Asphyxia;1;Asphyxiation or choking is a condition when a living body does not get enough oxygen.
Asphyxia;2;If this condition lasts long enough it can lead to unconsciousness, brain damage and death.
Asphyxia;3;Asphyxia can injure or kill people.
Asphyxia;4;This sometimes happens during suicide, torture, and in warfare.
Asphyxia;5;It can also be used as a capital punishment.
Asphyxia;6;It is also sometimes used nonfatally in martial arts, combat sports, and in some types of sex play.
Asphyxia;7;Because the need to breathe is controlled by the amount of the carbon dioxide in the blood, some victims may not experience an urgent need to breathe and may remain unaware of the shortage of oxygen in their body.
Maple syrup urine disease;1;Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a genetic medical disorder.
Maple syrup urine disease;2;It causes a problem with how the human body deals with amino acids.
Maple syrup urine disease;3;It is also called branched chain ketoaciduria.
Maple syrup urine disease;4;Maple syrup urine disease affects about 1 in 185,000 infants worldwide.
Maple syrup urine disease;5;The most noticeable symptom of the disorder is an infant with sweet-smelling urine.
Maple syrup urine disease;6;Infants with this disease seem healthy at birth.
Maple syrup urine disease;7;If the disease is not treated, the person will suffer severe brain damage and eventually die.
Maple syrup urine disease;8;MSUD is much more common in children of Amish and Mennonite descent.
Maple syrup urine disease;9;From a very early age, the condition can be recognised by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy, seizures, and mental health issues.
Maple syrup urine disease;10;The urine of infants with this disease has a very sweet odor, much like burned caramel or maple syrup.
Maple syrup urine disease;11;This is what gives the condition its name.

Megaloblastic anemia;1;Megaloblastic anemia is a kind of anemia.
Megaloblastic anemia;2;It can be caused by not having enough vitamins, especially Vitamin B12 or folic acid.
Leukemia;1;Leukemia or leukaemia is a cancer of white blood cells and bone marrow.
Leukemia;2;When a person has leukemia, the body creates too many white blood cells (leukocytes).
Leukemia;3;There are many kinds of leukemia.
Leukemia;4;Leukemia is part of a bigger group of diseases, the blood cancers (hematological neoplasms).
Leukemia;5;Without treatment, leukemia may lead to death within weeks, months, or years.
Leukemia;6;The life of the person depends upon the type of leukemia.
Leukemia;7;In 2000, about 256,000 children and adults around the world developed some form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it.
Leukemia;8;About 90% of all leukemias are seen in adults.
Leukemia;9;Leukemia can be either acute or chronic.
Leukemia;10;Acute leukemia usually grows quickly.
Leukemia;11;Chronic leukemia grows slowly.
Leukemia;12;Leukemia can also affect two different types of white blood cells.
Leukemia;13;These are lymphoid cells and young granulocyte cells (which are called myelocytes).
Leukemia;14;For this reason, all of the different forms of leukemia are divided into four main types:   Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia.
Leukemia;15;It is common in young children but can also be seen in old people.
Leukemia;16;Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is usually seen in people over the age of 55.
Leukemia;17;Children almost never have this.
Leukemia;18;Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is seen more commonly in adults than in children.
Leukemia;19;Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) happens mostly in adults.
Leukemia;20;The causes of most types of leukemia are not known.
Leukemia;21;In general, all cancers have a breakdown in the normal way cell division is controlled.
Leukemia;22;Most likely, the different kinds of leukemias have different causes.
Leukemia;23;The known causes account for relatively few cases.
Leukemia;24;Most of the causes are outside our control.
Leukemia;25;Researchers believe that some things may influence whether a person develops leukemia:   Exposure to Ionizing radiation   Exposure to certain chemicals, for example benzene.
Leukemia;26;"Certain viruses   Treatment with certain drugs that influence how cells develop; e.g."
Leukemia;27;"treatment of a tumor; Chemotherapy   Certain genetic factors."
Leukemia;28;Viruses that are believed to cause leukemia include:   Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV   Human T-lymphotropic virus   Fanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing acute myelogenous leukemia.
Leukemia;29;Most cases of leukemia are treated with many drugs, which are usually combined into a chemotherapy program.
Leukemia;30;In some cases, radiation therapies or bone marrow transplants are done.
Sexual assault;1;Sexual assault is when two people come in contact of a sexual nature, but one of the two people does not want this contact to happen.
Sexual assault;2;In some cases, one of the people involved may also be unable to consent to the contact.
Sexual assault;3;For example, they might be too young to consent or they may be unconscious.
Sexual assault;4;Rape is one form of sexual assault, but there are others.
Sexual assault;5;Different countries have different definitions of sexual assault.
Sexual assault;6;It is illegal, but often not reported.
Sexual assault;7;People convicted of sexual assault are sometimes sent to prison.
Sexual assault;8;In some places the crime of sexual assault has replaced the crime of rape.
Sexual assault;9;In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, rape is a separate crime to sexual assault.
Sexual assault;10;As many as 90-99% of people with developmental disabilities are sexually exploited before they are 18 years old.
Sexual assault;11;A 2010-2011 study in the United States of 1058 people aged 14 to 21 found that 8% had sexually assaulted in their lives.
Sexual assault;12;In 66% of cases no one found out and the perpetrator did not get into any trouble.
Sexual assault;13;50% said that their victim was completely to blame.
Sexual assault;14;2% had raped and 3% had tried to rape.
Sexual assault;15;In 2014 a study was published by the journal Gender & Society which found that girls and young women rarely reported abuse because they saw sexual violence against them as normal behavior from males.
Huntington's disease;1;Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder.
Huntington's disease;2;It affects the brain and gets worse over time.
Huntington's disease;3;This can lead to problems with moving, memory loss as well as thinking skills.
Huntington's disease;4;Lastly, it also causes changes in behavior.
Huntington's disease;5;Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease.
Huntington's disease;6;On average, the disease leads to death about fifteen years after the first signs of the illness show.
Huntington's disease;7;It is found in about 6 in 100,000 people.
Huntington's disease;8;There is a 50% chance of inheriting this disease from the parents.
Huntington's disease;9;The disease is named after George Huntington.
Huntington's disease;10;George Huntington specialized in medicine and psychology.
Huntington's disease;11;In 1872, he was the first to describe the medical condition he was seeing in patients in a paper about science.
Huntington's disease;12;"In an 1908 review, an important scientist who also focused on medicine and psychology, William Osler said about this paper: "" In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described. """
Huntington's disease;13;"According to Huntington, the disease is characterized by three things: it is inherited; people who have it become cases for psychiatry (insanity and people who kill themselves); and it only occurs in adults."
Huntington's disease;14;That was the medical understanding at that time.
Huntington's disease;15;Of these, the last one is wrong: some children also show signs of the disease.
Huntington's disease;16;Symptoms of Huntington's disease usually begin between the ages of 35 and 44 years.
Huntington's disease;17;They can, however, start in any age group from babies to old age.
Huntington's disease;18;Also, Huntington's disease kills the cells in the body and brain.
Huntington's disease;19;In fact, children with Huntington's disease are often much sicker.
Huntington's disease;20;They get worse faster.
Huntington's disease;21;Instead of having chorea, they usually have rigidity (or stiffness) of their muscles and it is painful.
Huntington's disease;22;Seizures (uncontrollable movements in the body) are also a common sign in children.
Huntington's disease;23;In 2015, there is still no treatment for the disease itself.
Huntington's disease;24;There are medicines available to help with some of the symptoms.
Huntington's disease;25;Tetrabenazine was approved in 2008 by the FDA.
Huntington's disease;26;This medicine helps slow some of the restless movements of chorea.
Huntington's disease;27;Other medicines that can help with psychiatric symptoms and movements are benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants usually taken for seizures.
Huntington's disease;28;Science Daily reported on May 6, 2019 that an international clinical trial has found a new drug is safe.
Huntington's disease;29;It reported that the drug used by UBC researchers successfully lowers levels of Huntingtin protein.
Birth defect;1;Birth defects (or congenital defects) are defects in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life.
Birth defect;2;There are two main types of congenital defect.
Birth defect;3;The first is caused by genetic abnormalities, which are hereditary.
Birth defect;4;The second is caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases) which a baby gets from its mother.
Birth defect;5;Sometimes doctors can find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth.
Birth defect;6;They use prenatal diagnosis and screening tests, such as amniocentesis.
Birth defect;7;Some gene alleles (versions of a gene) can damage the baby.
Birth defect;8;Conditions like dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin.
Birth defect;9;One type, achondroplasia, happens when a child's bones does not grow correctly.
Birth defect;10;Another type is caused by pituitary malfunction, where the pituitary gland, which puts out growth hormones, does not work properly.
Birth defect;11;Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations (or changes) in gene alleles.
Birth defect;12;Mutations can cause development to go wrong, or a simple biochemical deficiency (the body does not have enough of an important chemical).
Birth defect;13;In the case of a chemical deficiency, the problem may be curable.
Birth defect;14;For example, phenylketonuria was a cause of mental retardation.
Birth defect;15;Doctors came up with a simple test to find which babies have this condition.
Birth defect;16;They found that if these children got treated and followed a strict diet, they could get enough of the chemical they needed.
Birth defect;17;Phenylketonuria now causes few cases of mental retardation.
Birth defect;18;Another type of genetic defect is caused by errors in chromosome copying during the cell division which produces the gametes (meiosis).
Birth defect;19;Cells divide and copy themselves to produce gametes.
Birth defect;20;Sometimes, errors happen in the way that chromosomes are copied during this process.
Birth defect;21;These errors are then copied again and again as cells keep dividing and copying themselves.
Birth defect;22;The most common chromosomal disorder is Down syndrome ('Mongolism').
Birth defect;23;This condition happens when a child has three copies of the 21st chromosome, instead of two.
Birth defect;24;The other main type of congenital disorder is caused by an infectious disease being passed from mother to child.
Birth defect;25;For example, If a pregnant woman gets rubella, her child can have many birth defects.
Birth defect;26;Congenital syphilis was common a century ago, and congenital AIDS occurs today, and is common in some parts of Africa.
Birth defect;27;As time passes, screening and antibiotics has caused the number of infections transmitted by the mother to drop.
Birth defect;28;It is a much smaller proportion than a century ago, despite AIDS.
Birth defect;29;Also, maternal nutritional defects are much rarer, except in countries where food supply is limited.
Birth defect;30;Therefore, genetic disorders have grown as a proportion of the total congenital defects.
Birth defect;31;Sometimes mothers take chemicals which cause the embryo damage.
Birth defect;32;Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen.
Birth defect;33;Drugs taken by the mother may affect development of the embryo.
Birth defect;34;Pregnant women are not allowed to use some drugs.
Birth defect;35;For example, thalidomide should not be used by a pregnant woman, or it can cause many defects in the foetus.
Birth defect;36;If the mother took certain things during pregnancy, these can lead to problems with the baby.
Birth defect;37;Common examples of such things are smoking tobacco, or drinking alcohol.
Birth defect;38;Food related: Pregnant women should eat well.
Birth defect;39;If a pregnant woman does not receive enough folic acid with her food, the child can get neural tube defects.
Birth defect;40;Many women give up cigarettes and alcohol when pregnant, because this gives the embryo a better chance of developing normally.
Birth defect;41;About 3 percent of all babies have what is called a major physical anomaly.
Birth defect;42;This is something that damages the way the baby looks, or how it functions (its physiology).
Birth defect;43;Birth defects involving the brain are the most common problems.
Birth defect;44;They concern about 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart problems, at 8 per 1000, kidney problems at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000.
Birth defect;45;All other physical anomalies together occur in 6 per 1000 live births.
Birth defect;46;Birth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood.
Birth defect;47;They are the cause of 28% of infant deaths due to birth defects.
Birth defect;48;chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for 15%, and brain malformations about 12%.
Birth defect;49;About 10% of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease.
Birth defect;50;This is more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases.
Birth defect;51;China Birth Deformity Monitoring Centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every 30 seconds in China.
Birth defect;52;Pregnancies which do not come to term (miscarriages) have similar causes to birth defects.
Birth defect;53;Many will be due to failures in the genetics controlling development of the embryo.
Birth defect;54;Most clinically apparent miscarriages (two thirds to three-quarters in various studies) occur during the first trimester.
Birth defect;55;Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks.
Birth defect;56;A pregnancy with a genetic problem has a 95% probability of ending in miscarriage.

Goitre;1;A goitre or goiter (Latin: struma), also called a bronchocele, is a swelling in the neck (just below Adam's apple or larynx).
Goitre;2;It happens when the thyroid gland gets larger (usually because the body is not getting enough iodine).
Goitre;3;Goitres are classified in different ways (put into different categories):   A diffuse goitre is a goitre that has spread through all of the thyroid.
Goitre;4;"A diffuse goitre can be a "" simple goitre "" or a "" multi nodular goitre. """
Goitre;5;Toxic goiter is a goitre with hyperthyroidism.
Goitre;6;These most commonly caused by Graves disease, but they can also be caused by inflammation or a multinodular goitre.
Goitre;7;Any other type of goitre is called a non-toxic goitre.
Goitre;8;These may be caused by lithium, some kinds of autoimmune diseases, or other problems.
Goitre;9;People with non-toxic goiters have low thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) or normal thyroid levels.
Goitre;10;Some of the causes of goitre include:   Thyroid cancer   Iodine deficiency (not having enough iodine in the body)   Hashimoto's thyroiditis   Graves-Basedow disease   Congenital hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism that babies have when they are born, caused by errors in the way the body makes thyroid hormone)   Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland)   Side effects of certain medications   New research says that some people may be more vulnerable to goitre (more likely to have goiters) because they inherited that vulnerability (it was passed down to them from their parents).
Goitre;11;Within two years of each other, President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara Bush both were diagnosed with Graves disease and larger-than-normal thyroid glands.
Goitre;12;President Bush's disease caused hyperthyroidism and cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heart rate).
Goitre;13;Kim Il-sung suffers from goitre.

Stroke;1;A stroke is an illness in which part of the brain loses its blood supply.
Stroke;2;This can happen if an artery that feeds blood to the brain gets clogged, or if it tears and leaks.
Stroke;3;A stroke is when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain.
Stroke;4;There are two types of strokes.
Stroke;5;One is when there is a blood clot blocking the artery.
Stroke;6;The other type of stroke is when a blood vessel bursts and there is blood moving around freely in the brain.
Stroke;7;A stroke is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain.
Stroke;8;This can happen because of ischemia (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial embolism), or a haemorrhage (leakage of blood).
Stroke;9;As a result, the affected area of the brain cannot work properly.
Stroke;10;Symptoms might include: hemiplegia (an inability to move one or more limbs on one side of the body), aphasia (inability to understand or use language), or an inability to see one side of the visual field.
Stroke;11;A stroke is a medical emergency.
Stroke;12;It can cause permanent damage.
Stroke;13;If it is not quickly treated, it may lead to death.
Stroke;14;It is the third most common cause of death and the most common cause of disability for adults in the United States and Europe.
Stroke;15;Strokes happen on both the left and right side of the brain.
Stroke;16;When a stroke happens on the left side of someone’s brain, it affects the right side of the body.
Stroke;17;It can also cause problems with the patient’s speech and language.
Stroke;18;If a stroke affects the right side of the brain, it affects the left side of the body.
Stroke;19;It also changes patient’s spatial (relating to space) perceptions.
Stroke;20;Getting a stroke on the right side of the brain can also cause people to not acknowledge their illness.
Stroke;21;Patients behave impulsively and neglect the side of their body.
Stroke;22;Factors that increase the risk of a stroke include old age, high blood pressure, a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, atrial fibrillation, migraine with aura, and thrombophilia (a tendency to thrombosis).
Stroke;23;Of those factors, the most easy to fix are high blood pressure and smoking.
Stroke;24;"The Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale was designed to help "" pre-hospital "" medical professionals (like EMTs) identify a possible stroke before the patient gets to the hospital."
Stroke;25;It tests three basic signs.
Stroke;26;If any of these signs are not normal, the patient may be having a stroke and should be transported to a hospital as soon as possible.
Stroke;27;#Facial droop: Have the person smile or show his or her teeth.
Stroke;28;"#Normal: Both sides of face move equally   #Abnormal: One side of face does not move as well as the other (or at all); part of the face looks like it is drooping   #Arm drift: Have the person close his or her eyes and hold his or her arms straight out for about 10 seconds."
Stroke;29;"#Normal: Both arms move equally or not at all   #Abnormal: One arm does not move, or one arm drifts down compared with the other side   #Speech: Have the person say, "" You can't teach an old dog new tricks, "" or some other simple, familiar saying."
Stroke;30;#Normal: Patient uses correct words with no slurring   #Abnormal: Patient's speech is slurred, patient uses incorrect words, or is unable to speak   About 72% of patients who cannot do one of these three tasks normally are having an ischemic stroke.
Stroke;31;More than 85% of patients who cannot do all three tasks are having an acute stroke.
Stroke;32;The 'spot a stroke' campaign, created by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, teaches everyday people how to recognize a stroke.
Stroke;33;It teaches the basic tests from the Cincinnati Stroke Scale, using the acronym FAST:   F: Face - Facial Droop.
Stroke;34;Is one side of the face drooping or numb?
Stroke;35;Ask the person to smile.
Stroke;36;Is the person's smile uneven?
Stroke;37;A: Arm - Arm Weakness.
Stroke;38;Is one arm weak or numb?
Stroke;39;Ask the person to raise both arms.
Stroke;40;Does one arm drift downward?
Stroke;41;S: Speech - Speech Difficulty.
Stroke;42;Is speech slurred?
Stroke;43;Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand?
Stroke;44;"Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence, like "" The sky is blue. """
Stroke;45;Is the sentence repeated correctly?
Stroke;46;T: Time - Time to Call 911.
Stroke;47;If someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms go away, it is time to call 9-1-1.
Stroke;48;Once the patient is in the hospital, doctors can find out for sure whether they are having a stroke by looking at their brain with special scanning machines, like an MRI or a CT scanner.
Stroke;49;Strokes can kill.
Stroke;50;To prevent a stroke, doctors advise people to:   Control blood pressure   Stop smoking   Exercise at least once a week   Stay at a healthy weight   Do not drink too much   Get regular checkups   795,000 people in the United States get a stroke each year   One out of four people who have a stroke die (137,000 deaths from stroke per year)   Currently, 3 million people in the US have disabilities from strokes   In US, strokes cost $57.9 billion per year (damage and loss of work)   ⅔ of stroke happen in people 65 and up   Strokes affect men more than women   Women more likely to die from stroke than men   Strokes are more common in African Americans   Strokes are more likely to be fatal in African Americans   Stroke rates in older adults are declining but rates in younger people are rising (scientists think that it’s related to obesity)   Physical therapy can help patients   Some people are in a wheelchair after getting a stroke   10% of survivors suffer no long term disabilities   10% of survivors suffer from so many disabilities that they have to stay in 24 hour care   The basis for this article was the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke public domain resource at this page   Canadian Stroke Network   Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network   StrokEngine (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Focuses on stroke rehabilitation and interventions   Cerebrovascular disease and risk of stroke   video   American Stroke Association   National Stroke Association   Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada   The Stroke Association UK   Heart attack, stroke and cardiac arrest warning signs, from the American Heart Association   StrokeMD.net   National Stroke Association of Malaysia   Outcome of childhood stroke UK
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;1;Circadian rhythm sleep disorders happen when the circadian rhythm is not working correctly.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;2;They make people sleep and wake at times that are not normal, but these people usually have 8 hours of good sleep.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;3;These disorders affect other systems in the body, too, and not just sleep.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;4;"Circadian rhythms also control appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles.   """
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;5;"Extrinsic "" means something which comes from outside rather than from within a system or an organism."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;6;There are two circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the extrinsic type:   Jet Lag   Jet Lag often affects people who have travelled several hours east or west, through several time zones.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;7;It may take many days for the body to adjust.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;8;"The name "" jet lag "" comes from travelling by jet aircraft."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;9;Shift work syndrome   Many people have health problems when they work a shift during the times when their circadian rhythms say that they should be asleep.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;10;"Most people who work later than midnight find it difficult to stay awake.   """
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;11;"Intrinsic "" means something which happens or comes from within a system or an organism."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;12;There are four circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the intrinsic type.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;13;Unless they are caused by a head injury, they are usually genetic, that is, people are born with them.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;14;"They are generally chronic; they do not go away, but they may sometimes be treated."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;15;Advanced sleep-phase syndrome   Advanced sleep-phase syndrome (ASPS) is very rare.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;16;People with this syndrome are sleepy very early in the evening and they sleep from about 19:00-20:00 in the evening to about 03:00-04:00 in the early morning.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;17;Often several people in the same family have ASPS.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;18;Delayed sleep-phase syndrome   Delayed sleep-phase syndrome (DSPS) is more common than ASPS and it affects about 0.15% of adults.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;19;It usually starts in early childhood or at puberty.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;20;Some cases that start at puberty go away when the person is about 20 or 21 years old.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;21;DSPS is much more common in teenagers than in adults.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;22;DSPS in people older than about 20 usually will have it all their lives, that is, it is chronic.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;23;People with DSPS cannot go to sleep before 03:00-06:00 in the morning, or even later.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;24;They cannot wake up in time for school or a job which starts in the morning.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;25;They can go to sleep at the same time every night and get up at the same time each day.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;26;This means that they are entrained (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;27;"Even when they try to sleep at "" normal "" times, they feel most awake late at night."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;28;Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome   Non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome (Non-24) is quite rare.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;29;People with Non-24 have very unusual sleep timing.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;30;"Their sleep and wake times are not regulated by daylight; they are not entrained (adjusted, synchronized) to the daily light/dark cycle."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;31;This is called freerunning sleep.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;32;"The worst circadian rhythm sleep disorder in people who can see is Non-24; their "" daily "" rhythm lasts 25 hours or more so they sleep and wake up one or more hours later each day."
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;33;Appetite, body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles all keep moving around the clock, coming back to the same time after a few weeks.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;34;About half of totally blind people, who can see no light at all, have Non-24.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;35;Their daily rhythm is not exactly 24 hours and it does not adjust to the light/dark cycle in nature because they can not see light.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;36;This can often be treated.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;37;Irregular sleep-wake disorder   Irregular sleep-wake disorder is rare, and it is often possible to find out what causes it, for example, a head injury, a mental handicap, dementia or some other sicknesses.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;38;People with this disorder sleep and wake several times a day, but not at the same times every day.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;39;They sleep about 8 hours a day but never 8 hours together.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;40;Treatment for these disorders often does not work well.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;41;In addition, it can be difficult to find a doctor who knows much about circadian rhythms, as the field of study is quite new.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;42;Bright light   Treatment with bright light is also called phototherapy or light therapy.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;43;People with ASPS need a lot of light in the evening and they should avoid bright light in the morning.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;44;People with DSPS need bright light as soon as they wake up and should try to avoid bright light before bedtime.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;45;Melatonin   Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;46;It is normally only produced in the evening and at night.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;47;People with ASPS can take melatonin by mouth in the morning.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;48;People with DSPS can take melatonin in the afternoon or evening, and this treatment works also for some people with Non-24.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;49;One can buy melatonin in the shops in the USA and Canada.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorder;50;In most other countries one must get it from a doctor or it might not be legal at all.
Wound;1;In medicine, a wound is a type of physical injury where in the skin is torn, cut or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a bruise (a closed wound).
Wound;2;In pathology, it specifically means a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.
Wound;3;A mortal wound is one that leads directly to the death of the victim.
Wound;4;To heal a wound, the body undertakes a series of actions collectively known as the wound healing process.

Bruise;1;A bruise, also called a contusion or an ecchymosis, is a visible bluish or purplish mark or patch appearing beneath the surface of the skin, resulting from blood that leaked out of the deeper layers of the tissues.
Bruise;2;Bruises are usually caused by a blow or pressure.
Bruise;3;In older people, bruises may also occur without a special reason.
Bruise;4;Bruises often cause pain but are normally not dangerous.
Bruise;5;Sometimes bruises can be serious and lead to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, or they can be associated with serious injuries such as fractures and internal bleeding.
Bruise;6;"Minor bruises may be easily recognized, in people with light skin color, by their characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as "" black and blue "" ) in the days following the injury."
Bruise;7;Bruises change color over time.
Bruise;8;That is because the body is fixing the bruise by breaking down and reabsorbing the blood, which makes the bruise to go through many colors before it later disappears.
Bruise;9;The age of a bruise can be guessed by looking at its color.
Bruise;10;At the start, it is red because of the blood that is appearing just under the skin.
Bruise;11;Within the first five days the hemoglobin inside the blood changes and the bruise turns into the color of a bluish-purple or even black.
Bruise;12;Between five and ten days, the bruise usually becomes slightly green or yellow.
Bruise;13;Then, after 10 or 14 days, it finally becomes a yellowish-brown or light brown.
Bruise;14;Usually, a bruise takes about two weeks to fade away.
Bruise;15;Some people bruise easily, but others do not.
Bruise;16;This is because they may have more tough skin tissue, certain diseases or conditions, or they take certain kinds of medication.
Bruise;17;Also, blood vessels tend to become fragile as people get older, which is why elderly people receive a bruise much more easily.
Bruise;18;Applying cold when the bruise is discovered helps make it smaller, because it stops the blood that's flowing to the area.
Bruise;19;It also keeps the swelling down.
Bruise;20;It is best to apply ice to the bruise for half an hour to an hour at a time for a day or two after the bruise first appears.
Bruise;21;However, it is not advisable to place ice right on the skin.
Bruise;22;Putting some icecubes in a plastic bag and wrapping a towel around the bag is a better idea to stop the bruise from getting worse.
Bruise;23;Another way to help heal the bruise is to put the bruised area above the level of the heart.
Bruise;24;This helps to slow the flow of the blood because more of the blood in the bruise will flow back toward the rest of the body instead of leaking out into the tissues.
Bruise;25;If this is not done, more blood will flow into the bruise and make it grow.
Bruise;26;If the bruise causes pain, painkillers, such as NSAIDs may be used against the pain.
Bruise;27;Certain creams exist to help with bruises.
Bruise;28;These creams usually combine a substance that helps skin growth with one that acts against the pain.
Bruise;29;Gently massaging the area of the bruise may also help recovery, and stop the pain, according to the gate theory of pain.
Bruise;30;If the massage is painful, it will not help the healing process.
Bruise;31;As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until at least three days after the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped.
Bruise;32;Increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into the area and encourage drainage, but if the injury is still bleeding this will also allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.
Bruise;33;In most cases, hematomas spontaneously revert.
Bruise;34;In cases of large hematomas or those localized in certain organs (  , the brain), a physician may perform a puncture of the hematoma to allow the blood to exit.
Bruise;35;Bruises that do not result from the application of force (blunt trauma) may be a symptom for other conditions: People with such bruises often have a problem with their blood.
Bruise;36;Platelet or coagulation disorders often lead to the increased bruising.
Bruise;37;Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection.
Bruise;38;Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer.
Bruise;39;During an autopsy, bruises accompanying abrasions indicate the abrasions occurred while the person was alive, as opposed to damage that occurred after death   How to get rid of bruises - Home Remedies   Firstaidweb on bruises   What is a bruise?

Body dysmorphic disorder;1;Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental illness where people think they look different to how they really look.
Body dysmorphic disorder;2;People are usually said to have BDD if they are extremely critical of their body, even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it.
Body dysmorphic disorder;3;If there is something wrong with their body, it is usually so small that a person without BDD would not be unhappy about it at all.
Body dysmorphic disorder;4;People claim that they are insecure, but BDD is far worse.
Body dysmorphic disorder;5;Most people without BDD may not like some parts of their body, but people with BDD believe that they are so ugly, even though they are not, that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people, or live normally, scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look.
Body dysmorphic disorder;6;People with BDD often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain, or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly.
Body dysmorphic disorder;7;BDD is a somatoform disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder;8;People with BDD may look at themselves in the mirror too much, or some people with BDD may actually try not to look in the mirror.
Body dysmorphic disorder;9;Both of these are possible for a person with BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;10;They usually think about their body for more than one hour per day, and in bad cases, can stop talking to other people, and may stay at home.
Body dysmorphic disorder;11;People with BDD often have very low self-confidence, because they believe that a person's value is linked to what they look like, and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves, they do not think they have much value.
Body dysmorphic disorder;12;In 1886, BDD was first written about by the researcher 'Morselli', who named it Dysmorphophobia.
Body dysmorphic disorder;13;In 1987, BDD was first properly seen by the American Psychiatric Association.
Body dysmorphic disorder;14;In 1997, BDD was first recorded and formally seen as a mental problem in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
Body dysmorphic disorder;15;Sigmund Freud had an important Russian person (Sergei Pankejeff) with him in the past, who would have been classified as having the disorder in modern times.
Body dysmorphic disorder;16;"Freud named him "" The Wolf Man "" , to protect Pankejeff's identity."
Body dysmorphic disorder;17;Pankejeff was so unhappy with his nose that he could not live a normal life.
Body dysmorphic disorder;18;It is unknown what the full cause of BDD is.
Body dysmorphic disorder;19;However, research shows that a number of things may be the cause:   The chemicals in the brain.
Body dysmorphic disorder;20;If the amount of serotonin is too low, one of the brain's neurotransmitters which gives us 'mood' and 'pain', may help cause body dysmorphic disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder;21;Scientists can not explain this chemical problem in the brain, but it may be hereditary (passed down from parents to child).
Body dysmorphic disorder;22;Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder;23;Many people with BDD also have OCD, where the person does things without wanting to.
Body dysmorphic disorder;24;If people have had, or have a genetic link to OCD, the person may be more likely to have BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;25;Generalized anxiety disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder;26;Many people with BDD also have generalized anxiety disorder.
Body dysmorphic disorder;27;This disorder is where the person worries about things a lot, which makes them have anxiety about things in their life, for example, about their body, as in BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;28;BDD usually develops in adolescence, a time when people usually worry about their appearance the most.
Body dysmorphic disorder;29;However, many people with BDD suffer for years before they look for help.
Body dysmorphic disorder;30;When they do look for help to Doctors, people with the problem often say they have other problems, for example, depression, social anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, but do not say their real problem is with the way they look.
Body dysmorphic disorder;31;Most patients can not be convinced that the problem they have with their body is only 'imagined', and that they are seeing a 'changed' view of themselves, because people do not know much about BDD, compared to other mental problems, for example OCD or others.
Body dysmorphic disorder;32;The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) IV says that a person must have the things written below if they have BDD:   Being unhappy with an imagined problem on their body.
Body dysmorphic disorder;33;If a small problem is there, the person is unhappy with it more than they should be.
Body dysmorphic disorder;34;The unhappiness causes large problems in talking to other people, having a job, or living a normal life.
Body dysmorphic disorder;35;The unhappiness is not caused by a different mental problem (for example, unhappiness with weight in Anorexia Nervosa).
Body dysmorphic disorder;36;A person with BDD will often do these things:   Look in the mirror a lot, look in reflective doors, windows and other reflective surfaces.
Body dysmorphic disorder;37;If the person does not look in the mirror a lot, they will try not to look in the mirror or at photographs ever, and will often not have mirrors in their home.
Body dysmorphic disorder;38;Touch their skin a lot to feel the 'imagined' problem.
Body dysmorphic disorder;39;Wanting other people to say good things to them about the way they look a lot.
Body dysmorphic disorder;40;Asking other people about the way they look a lot.
Body dysmorphic disorder;41;Not talk to people a lot.
Body dysmorphic disorder;42;Not having much confidence   Comparing the way they look to people they want to look like a lot.
Body dysmorphic disorder;43;This may be of celebrities, or people in their life.
Body dysmorphic disorder;44;Doing exercise or having diets more than normal.
Body dysmorphic disorder;45;Doing these things a lot: combing hair, plucking eyebrows, shaving, etc.
Body dysmorphic disorder;46;Using medicine to change the body shape and body size.
Body dysmorphic disorder;47;Wanting plastic surgery or more than one plastic surgery, more than normal.
Body dysmorphic disorder;48;In some extreme examples, patients have tried to do plastic surgery to themself.
Body dysmorphic disorder;49;"Dr. Katharine Philips did research, with more than 500 people with BDD, on the percentage of patients unhappy with the most common parts of the body;   skin (73%)   hair (56%)   nose (37%)   weight (22%)   stomach (22%)   breasts/chest/nipples (21%)   eyes (20%)   thighs (20%)   teeth (20%)   legs (overall) (18%)   body shape / bone shape (16%)   all of face (14%)   lips (12%)   buttocks (12%)   chin (11%)   fingers (11%)   eyebrows (11%)   source: The Broken Mirror, Katharine A Philips, Oxford University Press, 2005 ed, p56   However, people with BDD often are unhappy about more than one part of their body."
Body dysmorphic disorder;50;A German study has shown that 1-2% of the population has complete BDD, but a bigger percentage of people show some of the effects (Psychological Medicine, vol 36, p 877).
Body dysmorphic disorder;51;The number of men and women with BDD is around the same, but there are slightly more women with it.
Body dysmorphic disorder;52;However, the number of men and women who go to the doctor with it are the same.
Body dysmorphic disorder;53;Studies show that BDD is common non-clinical places and clinical places.
Body dysmorphic disorder;54;Research was done on 200 people with DSM-IV BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;55;These people were aged 12 and older.
Body dysmorphic disorder;56;They were interviewed.
Body dysmorphic disorder;57;The people with BDD were found from 'mental-health doctors', advertisements, their friends and family, and non-psychiatrist physicians.
Body dysmorphic disorder;58;53 of the 200 people were receiving medication, 33 were receiving psychotherapy, and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy.
Body dysmorphic disorder;59;"How bad each person's BDD was, was assessed using the "" Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale "" , modified for BDD."
Body dysmorphic disorder;60;Symptoms were assessed with the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination.
Body dysmorphic disorder;61;Both tests were made just for BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;62;The results showed that BDD is in 0.7% - 1.1% of community samples and 2%-13% of non-clinical samples.
Body dysmorphic disorder;63;13% of psychiatric patients had BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;64;Research also found that some of the patients who were firstly diagnosed with OCD, also had BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;65;53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared to each other in research.
Body dysmorphic disorder;66;Clinical features, comorbidity, family history, and population features were compared between the two groups.
Body dysmorphic disorder;67;9 of the 62 subjects (14.5%) of those with OCD also had BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;68;In most examples, BDD is not found even when people have it.
Body dysmorphic disorder;69;In research done on 17 patients with BDD, BDD was 'found' in only five patients, and none of the patients had a proper diagnosis of BDD even though they all in fact had BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;70;BDD can cause only a few problems for some people.
Body dysmorphic disorder;71;However, for other people, it can cause many problems.
Body dysmorphic disorder;72;It can make it very difficult to have a normal job or family life.
Body dysmorphic disorder;73;People who have a job or a family to care for would definitely find life easier and better if they did not have BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;74;The love partners of BDD people can also suffer, as they may sometimes lose their loved one to suicide.
Body dysmorphic disorder;75;Friendship, romance, and family is very hard to hold for a person with BDD, as the unhappiness with the looks of the person takes over their life, so they often do not bother with the other aspects of life as much.
Body dysmorphic disorder;76;Also, the BDD stops the person from making these 'bonds' with people, as they always feel scared about the way they look, and therefore find it difficult to be themself with other people.
Body dysmorphic disorder;77;People with BDD may often have little motivation for anything.
Body dysmorphic disorder;78;This means that BDD people can appear to take a long time to get everything done.
Body dysmorphic disorder;79;However, this is not exactly true, because BDD sufferers will often just stop what they were doing for a long time, so it is not just that they are slow, but find it difficult to concentrate on what they are doing.
Body dysmorphic disorder;80;without being able to actually motivate themselves until it becomes completely necessary to get back up.
Body dysmorphic disorder;81;This low amount of motivation can be in all parts of a person's life, for example, school, friends, love, family, or work.
Body dysmorphic disorder;82;However, when the person is trying to do things to the way they look, such as combing their hair, or choosing clothes, it is common for the person to have an extreme motivation.
Body dysmorphic disorder;83;Therefore, people with BDD can sometimes not feel motivated for anything in their life, but when they are working on their looks, they will have an extreme motivation that is not normal either.
Body dysmorphic disorder;84;People with BDD have a very high suicide rate compared to all mental problems.
Body dysmorphic disorder;85;Phillips & Menard did a lot of research in 2006 about BDD suicides.
Body dysmorphic disorder;86;They found that the percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is 45 times higher than the percentage of all the USA population who commit suicide.
Body dysmorphic disorder;87;The percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is more than 2 times higher than the percentage of people in the USA with depression who commit suicide.
Body dysmorphic disorder;88;The percentage of people in the USA with BDD who commit suicide is 3 times higher than the percentage of people in the USA with bipolar disorder who commit suicide.
Body dysmorphic disorder;89;Some people say that there is a link between undiagnosed BDD and a higher than average suicide rate with people who had cosmetic surgery.
Body dysmorphic disorder;90;Another condition, Gender identity disorder (GID), where the person finds his or her gender as a male or female uncomfortable, often has BDD-like feelings that are only directed at the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics on their body, which disagree with the person's perception of their own gender since birth.
Body dysmorphic disorder;91;People with GID may also have BDD-like traits or their condition may be mis-diagnosed as BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;92;Most studies reported a pre- transition GID suicide attempt rate of 20% or more.
Body dysmorphic disorder;93;The suicide attempt rate for patients with BDD is 15%.
Body dysmorphic disorder;94;No studies are available showing overlap between GID and BDD suicide rate because BDD is excluded as a condition prior to GID diagnosis.
Body dysmorphic disorder;95;BDD and GID are different conditions.
Body dysmorphic disorder;96;One of the key differences is the fact that BDD responds to psychopharmacology, whereas GID does not.
Body dysmorphic disorder;97;Furthermore, psychopharmacology or psychotherapy are often successful in convincing the BDD sufferer that their perceptions are distorted.
Body dysmorphic disorder;98;Those with GID are rarely convinced that they are mistaken.
Body dysmorphic disorder;99;"GID (especially "" transsexualism "" ) also often manifests during early childhood, rather than during adolescence."
Body dysmorphic disorder;100;"It is standard practice in treating BDD to convince sufferers that surgical procedures are not necessary because eradicating their first perceived defect through surgery will only make them start obsessing about their next perceived defect, whereas those people properly diagnosed as "" transsexual "" under GID benefit greatly from surgical procedures specifically targeted at their primary or secondary sex characteristics."
Body dysmorphic disorder;101;However, a person with GID may also have BDD if they obsess over perceived defects on their body that contradict or go beyond their gender identity.
Body dysmorphic disorder;102;BDD is often wrongly thought of as a 'vanity' obsession, but it is actually the opposite, because people with BDD believe they are very ugly, even though people without BDD do not think they are.
Body dysmorphic disorder;103;There is not usually actually anything wrong with the way the person with BDD looks, but to that person, there is.
Body dysmorphic disorder;104;A person with BDD can spend hours looking in the mirror, but they are not being vain, as they do not think they are attractive.
Body dysmorphic disorder;105;People with BDD usually realize that worrying about their looks so much is bad, but they can not help it.
Body dysmorphic disorder;106;ALSO a person with BDD may alternatively avoid mirrors at all costs.
Body dysmorphic disorder;107;Or any reflective surfaces for that matter.
Body dysmorphic disorder;108;Including spoons, windows, mirrors, etc.
Body dysmorphic disorder;109;Research found that talking as therapy, has not worked to stop BDD.
Body dysmorphic disorder;110;However, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been found to be more effective.
Body dysmorphic disorder;111;In a study of 54 patients with BDD, some of them had Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and some had no treatment.
Body dysmorphic disorder;112;BDD symptoms decreased a lot in those patients undergoing CBT.
Body dysmorphic disorder;113;BDD was eliminated in 82% of cases at post treatment and 77% at follow-up.
Body dysmorphic disorder;114;(8) Due to low levels of serotonin in the brain, another commonly used treatment is SSRI drugs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor).
Body dysmorphic disorder;115;74 subjects were enrolled in a placebo controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of fluoxetine hydrochloride, a SSRI drug.
Body dysmorphic disorder;116;Patients were randomized to receive 12-weeks of double-blind treatment with fluoxetine or the placebo.
Body dysmorphic disorder;117;At the end of 12 weeks, 53% of patients responded to the fluoxetine.
Body dysmorphic disorder;118;Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a chronic disease that has symptoms that never subside.
Body dysmorphic disorder;119;Instead, they get worse as time goes on.
Body dysmorphic disorder;120;Without treatment, BDD could last a lifetime.
Body dysmorphic disorder;121;In many cases, as illustrated in The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips, the social lives of many patients disintegrates because they are so preoccupied with their appearance.

Cervical cancer;1;Cervical cancer is cancer of the cervix (the organ that connects the uterus and the vagina).
Cervical cancer;2;It is caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV).
Cervical cancer;3;It is a serious medical problem and sometimes causes malignance and death.
Cervical cancer;4;One sign of cervical cancer is bleeding or discharge from the vagina.
Cervical cancer;5;Sometimes, there are no symptoms until the cancer is very developed.
Cervical cancer;6;For this reason, pap smears have become common to diagnose this cancer.
Cervical cancer;7;They have cut the rate of cervical cancer in half.
Cervical cancer;8;For early cervical cancer, surgery is the first treatment.
Cervical cancer;9;For cancer that is farther along, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used.
Cervical cancer;10;Most types of cervical cancer can be prevented by a vaccine.
Cervical cancer;11;It prevents the types of HPV that cause 70% of cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer;12;Experts recommend that women get the vaccine and normal pap smears.
Arthritis;1;"Arthritis is a group of diseases where a person or animal's body joints are damaged. """
Arthritis;2;"Arthritis "" means inflammation of bone or body joint."
Arthritis;3;Arthritis can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness.
Arthritis;4;It can hurt to move with arthritis.
Arthritis;5;Arthritis is a condition that lasts for a long time.
Arthritis;6;There are more than 100 kinds of arthritis.
Arthritis;7;The three most common kinds are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout.
Arthritis;8;Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by bacteria).
Arthritis;9;Osteoarthritis is when the cartilage in between two bones breaks down.
Arthritis;10;This condition causes the bones to rub together.
Arthritis;11;This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people.
Arthritis;12;The most common places for this arthritis are the hips, knees, lower back, and neck.
Arthritis;13;There are medicines that can relieve the pain and prevent disability.
Arthritis;14;Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by autoimmunity.
Arthritis;15;Autoimmunity is when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues.
Arthritis;16;The most common places for this arthritis is in the wrists and the knuckles.
Arthritis;17;It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40.
Arthritis;18;Children and elderly people can also get this kind of arthritis.
Arthritis;19;There are medicines to slow down the process of this disease.
Arthritis;20;There are also some medicines to relieve pain.
Arthritis;21;It is important to treat this kind of arthritis early.
Arthritis;22;Gout causes severe pain and swelling.
Arthritis;23;Gout normally affects the big toe.
Arthritis;24;It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows.
Arthritis;25;Gout is from high levels of uric acid that is in the blood.
Arthritis;26;Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints.
Arthritis;27;Gout creates stone-like shapes.
Arthritis;28;The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons.
Arthritis;29;Arthritis is more common in older people.
Arthritis;30;Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect women more often than men.
Arthritis;31;Animals, including dogs and cats, can also get arthritis.
Pyromania;1;Pyromania is an impulse control disorder involving and obsession with fire and explosives.
Pyromania;2;Pyromaniacs frequently set fire to things.
Pyromania;3;They get pleasure or relief from seeing things burn.
Pyromania;4;Pyromaniacs are often convicted of arson.
Pyromania;5;When children have pyromania, later in life they usually are diagnosed with a mental disorder.
Pyromania;6;Pyromaniacs set fire to relieve stress and it gives them pleasure and relief.
Pica (disorder);1;Pica ( ) is an eating disorder where a person wants to eat things that are not normal to eat, for example nails, rocks or feces.
Pica (disorder);2;A person with pica may also have a strong want to eat unusual things that are normally considered food but not in the normal way, for example, uncooked potatoes, flour or starch.
Pica (disorder);3;It is common in small children.
Pectus excavatum;1;Pectus excavatum is a congenital medical condition where the ribs and sternum grow abnormally, producing a sunken appearance to the chest.
Pectus excavatum;2;This makes the chest look like it has caved in on itself.
Pectus excavatum;3;"It is also commonly referred to as "" funnel chest "" or "" chest bowl "" ."
Pectus excavatum;4;It is the most common form of pectus deformity, occurring in approximately 1 in 300-400 births, with a 3:1 male predominance ratio.
Pectus excavatum;5;While Pectus Excavatum occurs at birth, it often does not develop properly until early adolescence when growth is more rapid.
Pectus excavatum;6;Doctors do not know why some people have the dent.
Pectus excavatum;7;They think it might be caused by a bad gene from the parent.
Pectus excavatum;8;It is also linked to syndromes (illnesses) that affect other parts of the body.
Pectus excavatum;9;Pectus excavatum happens in about 1 in every 300-400 children, with the 75% majority of cases being male.
Pectus excavatum;10;A vacuum bell, also called a suction cup, can be used to fix pectus excavatum.
Pectus excavatum;11;The cup is placed on the chest and all the air is removed: this pulls up the chest.
Pectus excavatum;12;This non-invasive procedure shows promise to be a permanent cure for pectus excavatum.
Pectus excavatum;13;Treatment must continue for two years after the appearance of correction is made.
Pectus excavatum;14;The dent can be fixed by a doctor.
Pectus excavatum;15;The following are alternate surgical ways of fixing the chest:   The Nuss Prodcedure was created by Doctor Nuss from Norfolk in Virginia.
Pectus excavatum;16;"A metal bar is put into the chest; the bar holds the chest up."
Pectus excavatum;17;The Ravitch technique is from the 1950s.
Pectus excavatum;18;It involves cutting out part of the chest, placing a bar in the chest, and having the bone grow back.
Pectus excavatum;19;Most doctors do not use the Ravitch because it causes much blood loss.
Itch;1;Itch (Latin: pruritus) is an unpleasant sensation that leads to the desire or to .
Itch;2;Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different.
Itch;3;Pain creates a reflex withdrawal while itch leads to a scratch reflex.
Itch;4;Nerve fibers for itch and pain both are in the skin, but information for them is sent centrally in two distinct systems that both use the same nerve bundle.
Itch;5;Historically, the sensations of itch and pain have not been considered to be independent of each other until recently where it was found that itch has several features in common with pain but has important differences.
Itch;6;The feeling of itchiness can be caused by a movement of hair or the release of a chemical (histamine) from cells under the skin.
Itch;7;Itchiness is regarded as protective, as it helps creatures remove parasites that land on their skin.
Itch;8;Itching can be caused by:   Food poisoning   Xerosis.
Itch;9;This is the most common cause, frequently seen in winters.
Itch;10;Associated with older age, frequent bathing in hot showers or baths, and high temperature and low humidity environments.
Itch;11;Skin conditions (such as psoriasis, eczema, sunburn, athlete's foot, hidradenitis suppurativa and many others).
Itch;12;Most are of an inflammatory nature.

Trichotillomania;1;"Trichotillomania (TTM) (often called "" trich "" ) is an impulse control disorder."
Trichotillomania;2;It causes a person to habitually pull out their hair.
Trichotillomania;3;People with trichotillomania may pull hair from anywhere on the body.
Trichotillomania;4;Sometimes people with trich end up having large areas on the body without hair.
Trichotillomania;5;Trichotillomania is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
Trichotillomania;6;The DSM is written by the American Psychiatric Association.
Trichotillomania;7;It lists every condition which is officially called a mental illness.
Trichotillomania;8;"The DSM puts trich in the "" impulse control disorder "" category."
Trichotillomania;9;However, there are questions about what category trich should be in.
Trichotillomania;10;At different times, it may seem to be a habit, an addiction, a tic disorder, or an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Birthmark;1;A birthmark is a mark on skin that some people are born with.
Birthmark;2;Names given to types of birthmarks are: stork bites, Mongolian blue spots, strawberry marks, café au lait spots, nevus congenital melanocytic nevi, and port-wine stains.
Birthmark;3;A birthmark was once thought of as the mark of the devil, and today it is often considered a birth defect.
Birthmark;4;In some cases this mark is considered to be the mark of God applied to his chosen few.
Cough;1;A cough, also known as tussis, is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat.
Cough;2;To do this, muscles in the thoracic cavity contract to make air leave the lungs with a lot of force.
Cough;3;Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough.
Cough;4;Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages.
Cough;5;Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean like dust.

Sleep disorder;1;A sleep disorder is a problem that stops people from sleeping normally.
Sleep disorder;2;But really what is normal sleeping?
Sleep disorder;3;There are many sleep disorders, and some of them are very serious.
Sleep disorder;4;A test commonly ordered for some sleep disorders is the polysomnogram.
Sleep disorder;5;Sleep disorders can be put into groups.
Sleep disorder;6;These groups include:   Dysomnia - these are sleep disorders which cause too much or too little sleep.
Sleep disorder;7;Some of these are caused within the body while some are externally caused.
Sleep disorder;8;For example, insomnia and narcolepsy are two of the dysomnias.
Sleep disorder;9;Circadian rhythm sleep disorders - these cause sleeping at unusual times: too early, too late or not often.
Sleep disorder;10;"People with these disorders can usually get enough sleep, just at the "" wrong "" time of day."
Sleep disorder;11;These disorders are sometimes included among the dysomnias.
Sleep disorder;12;& db=mesh & list_uids=68020920 & dopt=Full MeSH   Parasomnias - these are doing things not normally done while sleeping, without the person being aware of what they are doing.
Sleep disorder;13;They include walking, eating, dressing, bedwetting and other events.
Sleep disorder;14;Medical or psychiatric disorders - these problems may also cause trouble sleeping.
Sleep disorder;15;People with depression or alcoholism may sleep poorly.
Sleep disorder;16;(Sleeping sickness, a disease carried by the Tsetse fly, is not classified as a sleep disorder.)
Sleep disorder;17;The most common sleep disorders include:   Bruxism: grinding or clenching the teeth while sleeping   Delayed sleep phase syndrome/disorder (DSPS): a circadian rhythm sleep disorder (see above): waking up and falling asleep much later than normal, but with no problem staying asleep   Hatzfeldt Syndrome, or Systemic Neuro-Epiphysial Disorder (SNED): an irregular sleep pattern, as well as irregular behavior   Hypopnea syndrome: abnormally shallow or slow breathing while sleeping   Narcolepsy: falling asleep spontaneously and unwillingly at the wrong times   Night terror disorder: sudden awakening from sleep showing fear or terror   Parasomnias, see above   Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD): Sudden uncontrolled movement of arms and/or legs during sleep, for example kicking the legs.
Sleep disorder;18;(Can seem like hypnic jerk, but hypnic jerk is not a disorder.)
Sleep disorder;19;"Primary insomnia, inability to get to sleep or stay asleep, not caused by any other disorder   Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD): acting out violent or dramatic dreams while in "" rapid eye movement "" (REM) sleep, also called dream sleep   Restless legs syndrome (RLS): urge or need to move legs."
Sleep disorder;20;People with RLS often also have PLMD.
Sleep disorder;21;Shift work sleep disorder (SWSD)   Sleep apnea (obstructive type): often waking suddenly when breathing stops, and usually loud snoring   Sleep paralysis: temporary paralysis of the body shortly before or after sleep.
Sleep disorder;22;Sleep paralysis may be accompanied by hallucinations of sight, hearing or touch.
Sleep disorder;23;It is quite common.
Sleep disorder;24;Sleepwalking: one of the parasomnias, see above   Changes in life style, such as shift work change or travelling over several time zones, can cause sleep disorders.
Sleep disorder;25;Some other problems that can cause sleeping problems include:   Anxiety   Pain   Environmental noise   Various drugs and medications   Hormone imbalance   Circadian rhythm disorders   A sleep diary or log can be used to help diagnose (define) the problem.
Sleep disorder;26;It can also be used to measure improvements.
Sleep disorder;27;According to Dr. William Dement of the Stanford Sleep Center, anyone who snores and is sleepy in the daytime should see a doctor about sleep disorders.
Sleep disorder;28;In case of chronic pain, both the pain and the sleep problems should be treated.
Sleep disorder;29;Pain can lead to sleep problems and vice versa.
Sleep disorder;30;The choice of a treatment for a sleep disorder depends on the patient's diagnosis, his/her medical and psychiatric history, and how she or he prefers to be treated.
Sleep disorder;31;Medications sometimes work fast.
Sleep disorder;32;On the other hand, sometimes behavioral treatment of insomnia may give more lasting results.
Parkinson's disease;1;"Parkinson's disease (or PD, sometimes simply "" Parkinson's "" ) is a disease that slowly damages the central nervous system."
Parkinson's disease;2;The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spine.
Parkinson's disease;3;When a person gets Parkinson's disease, the cells that make dopamine in a part of the brain die.
Parkinson's disease;4;Dopamine cells send information to other cells which makes us do the actions we do.
Parkinson's disease;5;Because of this, Parkinson's disease mainly affects the body's motor system.
Parkinson's disease;6;Parkinson's disease is a disease that gets worse over time.
Parkinson's disease;7;People normally get Parkinson's disease when they are over 50 years old.
Parkinson's disease;8;It is sometimes very hard for doctors to detect.
Parkinson's disease;9;Doctors are studying the exact causes of Parkinson's.
Parkinson's disease;10;It is said that Parkinson's develops through a combination of genetic errors and several possible influences, but not much is known.
Parkinson's disease;11;Doctors have discovered some clues about the cause(s) .
Parkinson's disease;12;It is caused by the destruction of specialised ganglions in the brain.
Parkinson's disease;13;The production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, reduces.
Parkinson's disease;14;Parkinson's can also be genetic.
Parkinson's disease;15;But research shows that genetic Parkinson's is not normal, and is uncommon.
Parkinson's disease;16;Parkinson's disease is more frequent among those who work with pesticides or have had a history of head injuries.
Parkinson's disease;17;Research suggests that people are slightly less likely to get Parkinson's disease if they smoke cigarettes.
Parkinson's disease;18;Parkinson's disease can cause the brain to not respond.
Parkinson's disease;19;The patient may become paralyzed.
Parkinson's disease;20;The disease can give the patient slow reaction time and poor coordination between the hand and the brain.
Parkinson's disease;21;It hurts the patient's movement skills and their speech.
Parkinson's disease;22;It can also affect mood, behavior and thinking.
Parkinson's disease;23;A common symptom of Parkinson’s disease is tremors.
Parkinson's disease;24;Tremors cause people's hands, legs, and arms to shake.
Parkinson's disease;25;Some symptoms include skin problems, depression, and difficulty swallowing.
Parkinson's disease;26;The symptoms of Parkinson's disease include stiff muscles and trouble with movement.
Parkinson's disease;27;This disease gives patients slow reaction time.
Parkinson's disease;28;It makes it hard for them to do simple things like walking and talking.
Parkinson's disease;29;It also causes depression and other emotional changes.
Parkinson's disease;30;Parkinson's disease cannot be completely cured yet.
Parkinson's disease;31;Still, people have tried to cure it with drugs.
Parkinson's disease;32;One treatment is to put back the lost dopamine.
Parkinson's disease;33;A group of drugs called dopamine receptor agonists acts similarly to dopamine when put in the brain.
Parkinson's disease;34;There are four different drugs included in that group.
Parkinson's disease;35;Many patients take one of those with another drug.
Parkinson's disease;36;That other drug is called L-dopa.
Parkinson's disease;37;Unlike the dopamine, the L-dopa can enter the brain.
Parkinson's disease;38;The dopamine cannot enter the brain.
Parkinson's disease;39;This is why many patients take L-dopa and dopamine together.
Parkinson's disease;40;In the beginning, L-dopa helps a lot.
Parkinson's disease;41;But as the disease develops, the L-dopa doesn't work as well.
Parkinson's disease;42;Two other drugs used are anticholinergics and selegiline.
Parkinson's disease;43;They both help lessen symptoms.
Parkinson's disease;44;Anticholinergics help the patient stop shaking.
Parkinson's disease;45;Selegiline is meant to protect the nerves in the central nervous system.
Parkinson's disease;46;Selegiline is not often used.
Parkinson's disease;47;This is because there is no real proof that it helps.
Parkinson's disease;48;Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgery that is used some people who suffer from Parkinson's disease.

Sepsis;1;Sepsis is a very dangerous disease that occurs when an infection goes wrong.
Sepsis;2;Normally the immune system of the body is able to fight the germs and overcome the infection, but in sepsis something goes wrong.
Sepsis;3;The pathogen was at some point able to get into the blood or tissues.
Sepsis;4;The term sepsis is frequently used to refer to septicemia (blood poisoning).
Sepsis;5;Septicemia is only one type of sepsis.
Sepsis;6;Bacteremia specifically refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream (viremia and fungemia are the terms used for viruses and fungi).
Sepsis;7;A sepis is a medical emergency, as it can put the life in danger, if it is not acted on.
Sepsis;8;Common symptoms of sepsis are inflammations all over the body.
Sepsis;9;This is often combined with high fever.
Sepsis;10;Today, people believe, these symptoms are caused by the immune system trying to fight the disease.
Sepsis;11;Because of the strong reactions, organs can be damaged in the process.
Sepsis;12;In a sense, the immune system over-reacts the germs and goes awry, causing damage to the organs.
Sepsis;13;In the United States, sepsis is the leading cause of death for ICU patients which do not have heart problems.
Sepsis;14;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows it is the tenth most common cause of death overall.
Sepsis;15;Older people, those with a weak immune system and those with a strong illness suffer from sepis more often.
Sepsis;16;It is also more dangerous to them.
Sepsis;17;It occurs in 1%-2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization.
Sepsis;18;It is a major cause of death in intensive care units worldwide, with mortality rates that range from 20% for sepsis to 40% for severe sepsis to over 60% for septic shock.
Sepsis;19;Severe sepsis and septic shock are more severe forms of sepsis.
Sepsis;20;With severe sepsis, one or more organs fail to work.
Sepsis;21;Septic shock is when sepsis is combined with very low blood pressure.
Sepsis;22;Today, the bacterial forms of sepsis can be treated with antibiotics.
Sepsis;23;In addition, the fluids (blood) containing the germs have to be replaced.
Sepsis;24;It might also be necessary to functionally replace the organs that failed.
Sepsis;25;It is important to begin to treat the sepsis as quickly as possible, as each hour it is left untreated will raise the chances of death by 5% to 10%.
Sepsis;26;About half the people affected and untreated die from the condition.
Sepsis;27;Rapid access to treatment will increase the chances of survival in most cases.

Tularemia;1;"Tularemia (also called "" Goblin Fever "" , "" deer-fly fever "" , "" Ohara fever "" and "" Francis disease "" ) is a disease."
Tularemia;2;In the USA, practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s.
Tularemia;3;"It was viewed as an attractive agent because:   it is easy to aerosolize   it is highly infective; 10-50 bacteria are required to infect   it is non-persistent and easy to decontaminate (unlike anthrax)   it is highly incapacitating to infected persons   it has low lethality, which is useful where enemy soldiers are in proximity to non-combatants, e.g."
Tularemia;4;civilians   By the late 1950s the US biological warfare program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent.
Tularemia;5;The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet.
Tularemia;6;It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent.
Tularemia;7;The rate-of-action was around three days, with a duration-of-action of one to three weeks (treated) and two to three months (untreated) with frequent relapses.
Tularemia;8;UL was streptomycin resistant.
Tularemia;9;The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern, being sensitive to sun light, and losing virulence over time after release.
Tularemia;10;The United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT (wet-type) and ZZ (dry-type) in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals.
Tularemia;11;When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT (an incapacitant rather than lethal agent), the Schu S4 strain's symbol was changed again to SR.   No vaccine is available to the general public.
Tularemia;12;The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs (as rabbits), avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources, and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites.
Tularemia;13;In summer 2000, an outbreak of tularemia in Martha's Vineyard resulted in one dead person.
Tularemia;14;It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis.
Tularemia;15;Over the following summers, Martha's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing.
Tularemia;16;The research may prove valuable in preventing bioterrorism.
Tularemia;17;An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000.
Tularemia;18;In 2004, three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F. tularensis, after apparently failing to follow safety procedures.
Tularemia;19;In 2005, small amounts of F. tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington, DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24, 2005.
Tularemia;20;Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall.
Tularemia;21;To this date, no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result.
Tularemia;22;In 2007, a lab of Boston University's Center for Advanced Biomedical Research, where F. tularensis were being kept for research, was evacuated after smoke set off alarms.
Tularemia;23;An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit, and no bacterial contamination was found.
Tularemia;24;In July 2007, an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and León and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region.
Mumps;1;Mumps is a viral disease.
Mumps;2;Only humans get it.
Mumps;3;Some of the most commons symptoms are fever, headaches, swelling of the parotoid glands, sore throat, and orchitis (which means swelling of the testicles).
Mumps;4;Mumps can be diagnosed by the increase in alpha amylase isoenzymes in blood plasma.
Mumps;5;The MMR vaccine stops measles, mumps and rubella.
Mumps;6;hence we can say that mumps can be prevented by MMR vaccination
Prostate cancer;1;Prostate cancer is a disease in which cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer;2;It is often treated with prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy.
Prostate cancer;3;Aggressive prostate cancer is now known to have a genetic basis.
Prostate cancer;4;Men with gene BRCA2 are more likely to get the cancer, and more likely it will be in its most aggressive form.
Menopause;1;Menopause means the natural and permanent stopping of menstruation.
Menopause;2;Female hormone levels drop, since they were produced by the ovaries which have now stopped working.
Menopause;3;The menopause starts when the ovaries stop releasing eggs every month.
Menopause;4;This can occur during old age or because the eggs have had surgery.
Menopause;5;Due to the change in hormone levels, women get hot flushes and palpitations, depression, anxiety, irritability, mood swings and lack of concentration.
Kuru (disease);1;Kuru is a disease caused by cannibalism, formerly thought to be caused by specifically eating human brains, but is actually caused by eating any human meat.
Kuru (disease);2;"It is also known as the "" laughing sickness "" due to the pathologic bursts of laughter that the patient displays."
Kuru (disease);3;Kuru was found in Papua New Guinea, among members of the Fore tribe.
Kuru (disease);4;"The word kuru means "" trembling with fear "" in the Fore language."
Staphylococcus aureus;1;Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of staph infections.
Staphylococcus aureus;2;It is a round bacterium, often living on the skin or in the nose of a person.
Staphylococcus aureus;3;About one third of the U.S. population are carriers of Staph.
Staphylococcus aureus;4;Aureus Staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases.
Staphylococcus aureus;5;S. aureus can be treated with antibiotics, but they easily get resistance to antibiotics.
Staphylococcus aureus;6;When they are resistant, they are called MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus).
Panic attack;1;Panic attacks are sudden periods of very bad anxiety.
Panic attack;2;Along with feeling very scared, people with panic attacks usually have physical symptoms.
Panic attack;3;These symptoms are not dangerous.
Panic attack;4;However, they can make a person feel terrible for a short time.
Panic attack;5;Having a panic attack is often terrifying and very upsetting.
Panic attack;6;Many people who have a panic attack for the first time call the emergency services because they think they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown.
Panic attack;7;Though panic attacks make people feel terrible, they are not dangerous.
Panic attack;8;Usually, the worst symptoms are over in ten minutes or less.
Panic attack;9;However, some panic attacks can be as short as one to five minutes.
Panic attack;10;Panic attacks can happen in people with all kinds of mental illnesses.
Panic attack;11;They can also happen in people who have no mental illness, but have just had something very bad happen to them.
Panic attack;12;"The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), DSM-5, describes a panic attack as:   "" An abrupt [sudden] surge of intense [very strong] fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes... [During that] time four or more of the following symptoms occur."
Panic attack;13;"The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state. """
Panic attack;14;According to DSM-5, a person is having a panic attack if they suddenly start feeling very scared and have four or more of these symptoms:   Palpitations (a pounding heart) or fast heart rate   Sweating   Trembling or shaking   Feeling unable to breathe   Feeling of choking   Chest pain or discomfort   Nausea or other gastrointestinal problems   Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint   Feeling hot, or feeling chills   Paresthesias (numbness or tingling feelings)   Derealization (feelings of not being real) or depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself)   Fear of losing control or going crazy   Fear of dying   Panic attacks happen when the body's natural fight or flight response gets overprotective.
Panic attack;15;Usually, the fight or flight response kicks in when a person is in danger.
Panic attack;16;It tells the sympathetic nervous system to make many changes in the body.
Panic attack;17;These changes will help the person fight or run away from the danger.
Panic attack;18;For example:   The person will get scared.
Panic attack;19;This makes them want to get away from the danger they are in.
Panic attack;20;The heart will beat stronger and faster.
Panic attack;21;This will get as much blood and oxygen to the body as possible.
Panic attack;22;Chemical messengers like epinephrine (adrenaline) will be sent out through the body, to give the body extra energy to fight or run away.
Panic attack;23;The body will stop digestion in the digestive tract.
Panic attack;24;The body does this because it wants to spend all its energy on fighting or running away.
Panic attack;25;It does not want to waste energy on things like digestion which will not help the person escape danger.
Panic attack;26;When a person is truly in danger, these changes in the body can help the person survive.
Panic attack;27;The changes in the body make it easier for the person to fight or run away from the danger.
Panic attack;28;However, when a person is having a panic attack, their body is reacting as if they are in danger, when they are really not.
Panic attack;29;Their fight or flight system kicks in and causes changes to the body.
Panic attack;30;But because the person does not need these changes to help them survive, the changes cause symptoms.
Panic attack;31;For example:   The person will feel very scared, even though they are not actually in danger.
Panic attack;32;The person may notice that their heart is pounding (because it is beating stronger) or beating quickly.
Panic attack;33;The person may notice side effects from the epinephrine that is being sent out through their body.
Panic attack;34;Those side effects can include sweating, chest pain, and feeling even more anxious.
Panic attack;35;Because digestion has suddenly stopped, the person may have nausea, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal problems.
Panic attack;36;Every symptom of a panic attack is caused by the fight or flight reaction.
Panic attack;37;This is why panic attacks are not dangerous.
Panic attack;38;The fight or flight system is meant to save a person's life if they are in danger.
Panic attack;39;If is a natural self-defense system in the human body.
Panic attack;40;When a panic attack happens, this life-saving fight or flight system is simply kicking in when it is not needed.

Rheumatism;1;Rheumatism or Rheumatic disorder is a general term for medical problems that can hurt the heart, bones, joints, kidney, skin and lungs.
Rheumatism;2;The study of these problems is called rheumatology.
Rheumatism;3;The major rheumatic disorders that are known, some are:   Ankylosing spondylitis   Back pain   Bursitis/ Tendinitis, Shoulder pain, wrist, biceps, leg, knee (patellar), ankle, hip, and Achilles   Capsulitis   Fibromyalgia   Neck pain   Osteoarthritis   Psoriatic arthritis   Rheumatic fever   Rheumatic heart disease (a long-term complication of Rheumatic fever)   Rheumatoid arthritis   Systemic lupus erythematosus   Temporal arteritis and Polymyalgia rheumatica   Tenosynovitis.
Rheumatism;4;"Many traditional herbal remedies were recommended for "" rheumatism "" ."
Rheumatism;5;Modern medicine, both conventional and complementary, shows that the different rheumatic disorders have different causes (and several of them have more than one) and need different kinds of treatment.

Gout;1;Gout is a very painful medical condition.
Gout;2;It is a red, tender, hot, swollen joint.
Gout;3;The attacks happen most often in the joint at the base of the big toe.
Gout;4;It is caused by crystals getting deposited from the blood.
Gout;5;This happens when the level of uric acid in the blood is too high.
Gout;6;The crystals then stay in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues.
Gout;7;Inflammatory arthritis happens in about 50% of all cases of gout.
Gout;8;The disease may also appear as kidney disease due to urate crystals.
Gout;9;People with gout often have more than one attack of gout.
Gout;10;Doctors decide a patient has gout if they find crystals in the joint fluid.
Gout;11;Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms.
Gout;12;Once an attack goes away, the patient can change his or her lifestyle to reduce levels of uric acid.
Gout;13;People who have gout attacks often may take allopurinol or probenecid to prevent symptoms later.
Gout;14;Gout has become more common.
Gout;15;It affects approximately one to two percent of people in the West during their lifetimes.
Gout;16;Risk factors have been increasing and may be causing the increase in gout.
Gout;17;Metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy, and changes in diet are the most common risk factors.
Gout;18;"Gout was historically known as “the disease of kings” or “the disease of rich men "" ."
Gout;19;Gout can present in a number of ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of intense inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint).
Gout;20;Joint pain usually begins over 2–4 hours and during the night.
Gout;21;Symptoms occur at night because of the lower body temperature at this time.
Gout;22;High levels of uric acid in the blood over a long period of time (hyperuricemia) may cause other symptoms such as hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi.
Gout;23;Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion.
Gout;24;High levels of uric acid in the blood may also cause crystals to form in the kidneys.
Gout;25;This causes stone formation followed by urate nephropathy.
Gout;26;A very high, abnormal level of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) is the basic cause of gout.
Gout;27;Diet and a person's genes are two of several possible causes of the high levels.
Gout;28;Levels can also become high if the body cannot excrete enough urate, the salts of uric acid.
Gout;29;The kinds and amounts of foods people eat cause about 12% of gout.
Gout;30;Drinking alcohol or fructose-sweetened drinks, and eating meat and seafood can cause this disease.
Gout;31;Injuries and surgery may also start an attack of gout.
Gout;32;Recent studies showed that some beliefs about connections between diet and gout were not true.
Gout;33;Eating purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) large amounts of protein do not contribute to developing gout.
Gout;34;Coffee, vitamin C, and dairy products, as well as physical fitness appear to decrease the risk.
Gout;35;These things reduce insulin resistance and may reduce cases of gout.
Gout;36;Inherited factors are about 60% responsible for the variability in uric acid level.
Gout;37;Two genes called SLC2A9 and ABCG2 are commonly associated with gout.
Gout;38;Variations in these genes can almost double the risk of developing this disease.
Gout;39;Gout often happens with other medical problems.
Gout;40;Metabolic syndrome happens along with nearly 75% of all cases of gout.
Gout;41;Gout often makes these other problems worse or harder to treat: polycythemia, lead poisoning, renal failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, and solid organ transplants.
Gout;42;Males have three times the chance of getting gout when the body mass index is greater than or equal to 35.
Gout;43;Frequent lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout because lead harms the kidney function.
Gout;44;Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate.
Gout;45;The blood deposits the crystals in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues.
Gout;46;These crystals then trigger a localimmune system inflammatory reaction.
Gout;47;Uricase is required to breakdown uric acid.
Gout;48;An evolutionary loss of uricase in humans and higher primates has made this condition so common.
Gout;49;The triggers that cause uric acid to build up in the blood are not well understood.
Gout;50;While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as uric acid levels increase.
Gout;51;Other factors believed to be important in triggering an acute episode of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration, and extracellular matrixproteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens, and chondroitin sulfate.
Gout;52;The increased critilization at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected.
Gout;53;Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to a number of factors, including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics, and stopping or starting the medication allopurinol.
Gout;54;Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic podagra.
Gout;55;If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, synovial fluid analysis should be done.
Gout;56;X-rays are useful for identifying chronic gout only.
Gout;57;X-rays are not useful for treating acute gout attacks.
Gout;58;A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joint fluid or a tophus.
Gout;59;All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed, inflamed joints should be examined for these crystals.
Gout;60;Under polarized light microscopy, the crystals have a needle-like shape and strong negative birefringence.
Gout;61;This test is difficult to perform, and often requires a trained technician.
Gout;62;The fluid must also be examined relatively quickly after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect their solubility.
Gout;63;Hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout.
Gout;64;Gout occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout.
Gout;65;The usefulness of measuring uric acid levels is limited.
Gout;66;Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/L (7.0 mg/dL) in males and 360 μmol/L (6.0 mg/dL) in females.
Gout;67;Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, renal function, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR).
Gout;68;Both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection.
Gout;69;A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×10  /L (40,000/mm  ) has been documented in people with gout.
Gout;70;The most important diagnosis to rule out in gout is septic arthritis (an infection in the joint).
Gout;71;This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment.
Gout;72;A joint fluid Gram stainand culture may be performed to support the diagnosis.
Gout;73;Other conditions which present similarly include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis.
Gout;74;Gouty tophi, especially when not in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma, or other cancers.
Gout;75;Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels.
Gout;76;Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of food such as meat and seafood, eating adequate vitamin C, limiting alcohol and fructose consumption, and avoiding obesity.
Gout;77;A low-calorie diet in obese men decreased uric acid levels by 100 µmol/L (1.7 mg/dL) on average.
Gout;78;Vitamin C intake of 1,500 mg per day decreases the risk of gout by 45%.
Gout;79;Coffee, but not tea, consumption is associated with a lower risk of gout.
Gout;80;Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea through the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells.
Gout;81;Treatment of sleep apnea can lessen the occurrence of gout attacks.
Gout;82;The first goal of treating gout is to reduce the symptoms of an acute attack.
Gout;83;Repeated attacks can be prevented by using different drugs that reduce the uric acid levels in the blood.
Gout;84;Ice applied for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day decreases pain.
Gout;85;Options for immediate treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids.
Gout;86;Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat and probenecid.
Gout;87;Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease.
Gout;88;Treatment of comorbidities is also important.
Gout;89;NSAIDs are the most common treatment for gout.
Gout;90;No specific type of NSAID is significantly more or less effective than any other.
Gout;91;Improvement may be seen within 4 hours.
Gout;92;Treatment is recommended for 1–2 weeks.
Gout;93;NSAIDs are not recommended for people with certain other health problems such as bleeding from the stomach, esophagus or intestines, renal failure, or heart failure.
Gout;94;While indomethacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, ibuprofen may be preferred due to its lack of side effects.
Gout;95;A proton pump inhibitor may be given to people at risk of experiencing gastric side effects.
Gout;96;Colchicine is an alternative treatment for people that are unable to tolerate NSAIDs.
Gout;97;Its side effects, primarily gastrointestinal upset limit its use.
Gout;98;The occurrence of gastrointestinal upset depends on the dose.
Gout;99;The risk of experiencing this side effect can be reduced by using smaller, yet still effective doses.
Gout;100;Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs such as atorvastatin and erythromycin.
Gout;101;Glucocorticoids (otherwise known as steroids) have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs for treating gout.
Gout;102;Glucocorticoids may be used if it is not possible to use NSAIDs.
Gout;103;Using glucocorticoids also lead to improvement when it is injected into the joint.
Gout;104;A joint infection must be excluded if the condition worsens.
Gout;105;Pegloticase (Krystexxa) was approved in the USA to treat gout in 2010.
Gout;106;It will be a treatment option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications.
Gout;107;Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks and has been found to reduce uric acid levels in this population.
Gout;108;A number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including xanthine oxidase inhibitor (including allopurinol and febuxostat), and uricosurics (including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone).
Gout;109;They are not usually given until one to two weeks after an acute attack has resolved due to concerns that it may worsen attack symptoms.
Gout;110;These medications are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first 3–6 months.
Gout;111;This treatment is not recommended until a person has suffered two gout attacks, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist.
Gout;112;This type of treatment is delayed until this point because is not cost effective to offer this treatment sooner.
Gout;113;Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360 µmol/L (5.0-6.0 mg/dL).
Gout;114;This treatment should be continued forever.
Gout;115;These medications should be continued even if the person experiences a gout attack while on the medication.
Gout;116;Uricosuric drugs are preferred for treating gout if there is not enough uric acid in the urine defined by a 24-hour collection of urine with less than 800 mg of uric acid.
Gout;117;Uricosuric drugs are not recommended if the person has a history of renal stones.
Gout;118;A 24-hour urine excretion of more than 800 mg indicates overproduction and xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the preferred drugs for providing treatment.
Gout;119;Note that probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol.
Gout;120;Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (including allopurinol and febuxostat) block uric acid production.
Gout;121;Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with reduced renal function or urate stones.
Gout;122;Allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals.
Gout;123;In such cases, the alternative drug febuxostat has been recommended.
Gout;124;Without treatment, an acute attack of gout will usually resolve in 5 to 7 days.
Gout;125;60% of people will have a second attack within one year.
Gout;126;Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and renal and cardiovascular disease and at increased risk of death.
Gout;127;This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be simply due to having gout.
Gout;128;Without treatment, acute gout attacks may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi.
Gout;129;These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the outer part of the ear, over the outer part of the elbow, or on the Achilles tendons.
Gout;130;With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve.
Gout;131;Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people.
Gout;132;Kidney stones occur due to low urine pH promoting the crystallization of uric acid.
Gout;133;Other forms of chronic renal dysfunction may occur.
Gout;134;Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lives and it is becoming more common.
Gout;135;Rates of gout have approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010.
Gout;136;This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet, and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure.
Gout;137;A number of factors have been found to influence rates of gout, including age, race, and the season of the year.
Gout;138;In men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50, prevalence is 2%.
Gout;139;In the United States, gout is twice as likely to occur in African American males as it is in European Americans.
Gout;140;Rates are high among the peoples of the Pacific Islands and the Māori of New Zealand, but rare in Australian aborigines, despite a higher average concentration of serum uric acid in the aboriginal group.
Gout;141;Gout has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban sub-Saharan Africa.
Gout;142;Some studies have found that gout attacks occur more frequently in the spring.
Gout;143;This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature.
Gout;144;The word gout was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 a.d.
Gout;145;"It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning "" a drop "" (of liquid)."
Gout;146;"According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and "" the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints "" ."
Gout;147;People have been aware of gout since ancient times.
Gout;148;"Historically, it has been referred to as "" the king of diseases and the disease of kings "" or "" the disease of rich men "" ."
Gout;149;The first documentation of the disease is from Egypt in 2,600 b.c.
Gout;150;in a description of arthritis of the largest toe.
Gout;151;The Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 b.c.
Gout;152;commented on it in his Aphorisms and noted its absence in eunuchs (men who have had there testicles removed at a young age) and women before menopause.
Gout;153;Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 a.d.) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women, and associated kidney problems:      In 1683, Thomas Sydenham, an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning, and its more frequent occurrence in older males:      The Dutch scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679.
Gout;154;In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod realized that this excess uric acid in the blood was the cause of gout.
Gout;155;Gout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid.
Gout;156;Humans and other great apes don't have this ability, which makes gout common.
Gout;157;"The Tyrannosaurus rex specimen known as "" Sue "" , however, is believed to have suffered from gout."
Gout;158;A number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept.
Gout;159;A man made uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is also available.
Gout;160;Its use is limited because it triggers an autoimmune response.
Gout;161;Versions of this medication that are less prone to cause allergies are in development.
Bright's disease;1;Bright's disease is a historical classification of kidney diseases that are now called acute or chronic nephritis.
Bright's disease;2;The main symptom is the presence of serum albumin (blood plasma protein) in the urine, and frequently accompanied by oedema and hypertension.
Bright's disease;3;The term is no longer used, as the disease is now classified by its better known causes.
Liver cancer;1;Liver cancer is malignant tumors on, or in, a liver.
Liver cancer;2;The most common form of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which is more common in those with cirrhosis of the liver, which may be caused by alcohol abuse, Wilson's disease, or hepatitis.
Liver cancer;3;Hepatoblastoma occurs most often in children.
Stuttering;1;This page is about speech problems, the album can be found at Hands All Over   Stuttering or stammering is a problem some people have when they speak.
Stuttering;2;5-6% of children have a stammer while 1% of adults have a stammer.
Stuttering;3;Men are 4 times more likely to have a stammer than women.
Stuttering;4;Stammers normally start at 2-6 years and run in families.
Stuttering;5;The person knows what they want to say but the flow of their speech is ‘bumpy’ and may have some of the following features:   Repetitions (of sounds, parts of words or phrases)   Blocks (stops before words)   Prolongations (making a sound longer, e.g.hhhhhhhhhham instead of ham)   Pauses   Rephrasing (saying something else instead)   Hesitations (struggling to say words)   Fillers (using key phrases such as ‘you know what I mean’ to hide their difficulties)   Tension (the muscles in their face and neck look tight)   Facial or body movements   Stammering can be very upsetting and knock a person's confidence.
Stuttering;6;Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the bumpy parts you can hear (overt parts) of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger block of how the person feels (covert parts) invisible below the surface.
Stuttering;7;These people may feel embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt.
Stuttering;8;These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more.
Stuttering;9;Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program.
Stuttering;10;Stammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends.
Stuttering;11;"Stuttering therapy   This therapy is also known as "" speak more fluently "" , "" prolonged speech "" or "" connected speech. """
Stuttering;12;It trains stutterers to speak fluently (without the ‘bumpy bits’) by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips, jaw, and tongue.
Stuttering;13;Stutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants.
Stuttering;14;Other methods include soft speech contacts.
Stuttering;15;This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic.
Stuttering;16;To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased.
Stuttering;17;Many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy.
Stuttering;18;Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete.
Stuttering;19;More recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to work well.
Stuttering;20;The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to get rid of stuttering but to change it so that stuttering is easier and less stressful.
Stuttering;21;As fear and worry make people stutter by getting rid of these feelings stuttering will decrease.
Stuttering;22;The most widely known approach was made by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.
Stuttering;23;Stuttering modification therapy has four stages: 	   In the first stage, called identification, the stutterer and speech and language therapist work out the core behaviours, secondary behaviors, and feelings that make the stuttering.
Stuttering;24;In the second stage, called desensitization, the stutterer works to reduce fear and anxiety.
Stuttering;25;"This is done by freezing stuttering behaviors, confronting difficult sounds, words and situations, and stuttering on purpose ( "" voluntary stuttering "" )."
Stuttering;26;"In the third stage, called modification, the stutterer learns "" easy stuttering. """
Stuttering;27;"This is done by "" cancellations "" (stopping in a stammer, waiting a few moments, and saying the word again); "" pull-outs, "" or pulling out of a stammer into ‘normal’ speech; and "" preparatory sets, "" or looking ahead for words they may stutter on, and using "" easy stuttering "" on those words."
Stuttering;28;In the fourth stage, called stabilization, the stutterer prepares practice assignments, makes preparatory sets and pull-outs automatic, and changes how they feel about themselves from being a person who stutters to being a person who speaks fluently but who sometimes stutters mildly.
Stuttering;29;There were many famous stutterers:   Demosthenes   Isaac Newton   Gareth Gates   Notker Balbulus   Scatman John   Winston Churchill   King George VI   Bruce Willis   Ozzy Osbourne   Tiger Woods   Mel Tillis
Amputation;1;Amputation is the act of cutting off a part of the human body, sometimes because of medical reasons.
Amputation;2;In some countries, amputation of the hands, feet or other body parts was used as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes.
Amputation;3;A person who has had an arm or leg removed is known as an amputee.

Helicobacter pylori;1;Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives in or on the lining of the stomach.
Helicobacter pylori;2;It causes more than 90 percent of ulcers, which are sores in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).
Helicobacter pylori;3;Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, doctors thought that spicy food, acid, stress and lifestyle caused most ulcers.
Helicobacter pylori;4;Because doctors now know that most ulcers are caused by an H. pylori infection, they can be cured with the correct antibiotics.
Helicobacter pylori;5;Heliobacter pylori was first discovered by Australian scientists, Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren.
Helicobacter pylori;6;They won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 for their work.
Cellulite;1;Cellulite is a dimpled appearance of the skin, caused by fat cells pushing against the body's connective tissue.
Cellulite;2;"The word "" cellulite "" only refers to how the skin looks, and does not describe a medical condition."
Cellulite;3;Cellulite is not related to cellulitis which is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin.
Cellulite;4;"80-90% of women around the world are thought to have cellulite, and most doctors think that it is the "" normal condition of many women "" ."
Cellulite;5;Cellulite is closely linked with female hormones such as estrogen, and rarely appears in men.
Cellulite;6;Cellulite is most common on the upper legs (or thighs), buttocks and the abdomen.
Cellulite;7;The appearance of cellulite has been linked to hormonal changes, changes in diet, stress, and poor blood circulation.
Cellulite;8;Cellulite has little to do with weight.
Cellulite;9;Both slim people and overweight ones can have cellulite.
Cellulite;10;Cellulite is often hereditary, meaning that you get it from the genes passed on to you from your parents.
Cellulite;11;This can mean many things because you can inherit your body type, shape, and hormonal function from your parents.
Cellulite;12;Normal hormone functions can cause or change the appearance of cellulite.
Cellulite;13;Estrogen, prolactin, thyroid hormones, and stress hormones may all play a role.
Cellulite;14;There are lots of treatments for cellulite reduction, but none have been proven by doctors to be effective.
Cellulite;15;"Doctors have stated that "" there is no outstanding treatment for cellulite "" and that "" realistically, there is no cure for cellulite. """
Brain damage;1;Brain damage is damage to the brain from either illnesses or injuries.
Brain damage;2;Brain cells are damaged, which often affects one's brain in a way that stops the brain from thinking or reacting the same way as it did before the brain was damaged.
Brain damage;3;Physical damage to the brain is called traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Brain damage;4;It has occurred since ancient times, and old medical records exist.
Brain damage;5;Head injuries and their effects were known in ancient times.
Brain damage;6;Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech.
Brain damage;7;The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550 BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability.
Brain damage;8;Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain to be the center of thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.
Brain damage;9;Perhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage.
Brain damage;10;He survived an accident in 1848 when a large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying at least his left frontal lobe.
Brain damage;11;He recovered with no apparent sensory, movement, or big cognitive damage.
Brain damage;12;"However, his behaviour so altered that friends described him as "" no longer being Gage "" ."
Brain damage;13;"This suggested that the damaged areas are involved in "" higher functions "" such as personality."
Brain damage;14;Many cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.
Brain damage;15;In the 1970s, awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew.
Brain damage;16;A great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research, such as the discovery of primary and secondary brain injury.
Brain damage;17;The 1990s saw the development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of TBI, with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure.
Brain damage;18;Research since the early 1990s has improved TBI survival.

Snoring;1;Snoring is the noise that people often make when they are sleeping.
Snoring;2;It is often caused by a blocked nose or throat.
Snoring;3;The noise is often loud, as it is made by air passing through the nasal passages, the nostrils, or the throat.
Appendicitis;1;Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix.
Appendicitis;2;The appendix is a pouch at the start of the large intestine.
Appendicitis;3;Symptoms usually include a sharp pain in the lower right abdomen.
Appendicitis;4;Also, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite are common.
Appendicitis;5;However, about 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms.
Appendicitis;6;If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful peritonitis, and sepsis.
Appendicitis;7;Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis.
Appendicitis;8;Usually the infected appendix is taken out.
Appendicitis;9;The function of the appendix in apes is the digestion of vegetable matter such as leaves.
Appendicitis;10;Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus.
Appendicitis;11;Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our immune system does not serve it well.
Appendicitis;12;An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body.
Appendicitis;13;The causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or bacterial infections.
Appendicitis;14;If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock.
Appendicitis;15;Most serious appendicitis happens to younger children and elder adults.
Appendicitis;16;Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females.
Appendicitis;17;The most usual treatment is an appendectomy which means removing the appendix.
Appendicitis;18;Sometimes, it gets better without surgery.
Appendicitis;19;Some people think that eating vegetables will help, but no chances should be taken.
Appendicitis;20;Seek medical advice if in doubt.
Appendicitis;21;Reginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886.
Appendicitis;22;"It is one of the leading causes worldwide of "" pain in the abdomen "" , a term used in medicine and surgery to cover a wide range of causes."
Cluster headache;1;Cluster headaches are a type of headache.
Cluster headache;2;They are the least common type of headache.
Cluster headache;3;Cluster headaches are very painful.
Cluster headache;4;They usually cause very strong pain on one side of the head, behind the eye and temple.
Cluster headache;5;The headaches can last anywhere from 15–180 minutes.
Cluster headache;6;People with severe cases may have cluster headaches many times a day.
Cluster headache;7;Cluster headaches may also cause other symptoms.
Cluster headache;8;Most people get restless or agitated during an attack.
Cluster headache;9;Some people get a runny or stuffy nose.
Cluster headache;10;The eye on the side of the head that hurts can also get red or start tearing up.
Cluster headache;11;"They are called "" cluster headaches "" because they usually come and go."
Cluster headache;12;For a while, person may have many attacks of cluster headaches.
Cluster headache;13;Sometimes, they may then have no cluster headaches for a while.
Cluster headache;14;If a person has no cluster headaches for a while, this is called a remission period.
Cluster headache;15;No one knows why remission periods happen.
Cluster headache;16;Some people with cluster headaches never have a remission period.
Cluster headache;17;Cluster headaches can be genetic (passed down through families).
Cluster headache;18;However, when they are, a person may never have a cluster headache unless they have a bad head injury.
Cluster headache;19;In people who do not carry a gene for cluster headaches, nobody knows what causes them.

Self-harm;1;REDIRECT Self-injury
Concussion;1;Concussion is an injury to the brain caused by being hit on the head, as often happens in motor vehicle collisions, fights or contact sports such as football.
Concussion;2;It is the most common form of traumatic brain injury.
Concussion;3;Related terms include mild brain injury, mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), mild head injury (MHI), and minor head trauma.
Concussion;4;Patients with severe concussion are occasionally monitored in hospital.
Concussion;5;The main reason for this is the risk of bleeding in the brain, which can be life-threatening.
Concussion;6;Common symptoms of concussion include: headache, dizziness, fatigue, problems with vision, confusion and loss of consciousness.
Concussion;7;A person with a mild concussion may have nothing more than a headache or brief confusion.
Concussion;8;In more severe cases, symptoms tend to last longer, and may include loss of consciousness.
Concussion;9;Other associated symptoms are: worsening headache, inability to wake, dilation of the eyes, vomiting, nausea, loss of coordination and weakness of extremities.
Concussion;10;Symptoms may last less than a week in minor cases, but recovery from more severe concussions can take up to 4 weeks.
Concussion;11;"The most common causes of concussions are accidents; in some cases, wearing a helmet can help prevent major damage."
Concussion;12;One often underreported symptom of concussion is aphasia.
Concussion;13;"Aphasia is the loss of ability to produce or understand speech; it is caused by brain damage."
Concussion;14;Most of the important areas for speech and language are located in the left hemisphere.
Concussion;15;As such, patients who have concussions due to injury on the left side of the head could be more at risk for these symptoms.
Concussion;16;The most common kinds of aphasia associated with traumatic brain injury are amnestic aphasia and verbal paraphasia.
Concussion;17;Amnesic aphasia, also known as anomia, is an issue with word finding where patients struggle to find words for objects that they once knew.
Concussion;18;There is no impairment of comprehension associated with anomia.
Concussion;19;This can be especially challenging for students trying to return to school and professionals returning to work.
Concussion;20;The second kind of aphasia associated with concussion is verbal paraphasia, the substitution of one word for another.
Concussion;21;"Typically, the substituted word will have a similar meaning as the word it replaces; e.g."
Concussion;22;substituting sock with shoe.
Concussion;23;As with most concussion symptoms, aphasia symptoms correlated with concussion typically get progressively better, as evidenced by a study done by Inger Vibeke Thomsen.
Concussion;24;Of the concussion patients studied that showed aphasia symptoms, only one patient had long term aphasia.
Concussion;25;The others showed almost full recovery.
Concussion;26;The National Aphasia Association recognizes that concussions can cause aphasia.
Concussion;27;In serious concussions, aphasia is a documented symptom and can be temporary or permanent.
Concussion;28;This is correlated to injury of brain regions that are important for language production.
Concussion;29;However, traumatic brain injuries usually effect multiple areas of the brain, so other symptoms will also be present.
Concussion;30;The damage causing aphasia will usually be on the left side of the brain.
Vitiligo;1;Vitiligo is a skin disease that causes the skin to lose its color.
Vitiligo;2;It occurs when the melanocytes, cells that give skin their color, die or do not work.
Vitiligo;3;This is a problem because these cells protect against the light from the sun.
Vitiligo;4;The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood.
Vitiligo;5;It may be caused by the immune system, genetic, and environmental factors.
Vitiligo;6;Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system, leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment.
Vitiligo;7;People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease.
Vitiligo;8;These patches often occur to both sides symmetrically and may change shape.
Vitiligo;9;color of the skin is lighter because there are no pigments   purple or golden brown patches on and around the eyes, nose, and mouth   puffiness of the middle layer of the eye   quicker graying of hair   more sensitive to sun   This disease can also affect the mental state of the patient.
Vitiligo;10;As of 2020, doctors do not understand what causes the disease, so right now, it can not be cured.
Vitiligo;11;Some things can be done to fight its effects, though.
Vitiligo;12;Makeup or cosmetics can cover up the parts of the skin with vitiligo.
Vitiligo;13;Also, staying out of the sun to prevent tanning is good.
Vitiligo;14;But the treatment given by most skin doctors is cortico steroid cream.
Vitiligo;15;Breakthrough discovery in 2004 allowed for the transplant of melanocytes to vitiligo affected areas, repigmenting the region.
Vitiligo;16;Michael Jackson told Oprah in a 1993 interview that he had vitiligo.
Vitiligo;17;He is the most well known person to have had the disease.
Vitiligo;18;A lot of people thought that he was lying.
Vitiligo;19;He died in 2009, and his autopsy found that he was telling the truth.
Vitiligo;20;Apparently, when it got past the point where makeup could have hidden it, he chose to have the rest of the pigment removed.
Vitiligo;21;Jon Hamm got vitilgo when he was filmed acting for Mad Men because of stress.
Catarrh;1;Catarrh () is a thick fluid of mucus and white blood cells caused by the swelling of the mucous membranes in the head because of an infection.

Eating disorder;6;Many people with eating disorders are very sad and feel alone.
Eating disorder;7;They get depressed and do not want to eat in front of other people.
Eating disorder;8;They might use food as a way to cope, or they might restrict their food intake as a means of control.
Eating disorder;9;They might eat a lot of food in a very short period of time.
Eating disorder;10;They might throw up their food because they feel guilty.
Eating disorder;11;They might eat very little because they want to lose weight, even if they are already dangerously underweight (weighing less than what it is considered healthy).
Eating disorder;12;Even if they are underweight, they might see themselves as very fat.
Eating disorder;13;Many people with eating disorders suffer physical complications, like malnutrition (not getting enough nutrients that the body needs to be healthy), or electrolyte imbalances (a change in the amount of elements such as sodium or potassium that causes problems in the body's ability to work properly).

Diphtheria;6;These people may have no obvious signs or symptoms.
Diphtheria;7;Infected people who do not know they have diphtheria are called carriers of diphtheria, because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves.
Diphtheria;8;A second type of diphtheria can affect the skin.
Diphtheria;9;This type of diphtheria is called cutaneous diphtheria.
Diphtheria;10;It causes pain, redness, and swelling on the skin, like other bacterial skin infections.
Diphtheria;11;People with cutaneous diphtheria may get ulcers, covered by a gray membrane, on their skin.

Candidiasis;4;Candida albicans is the most common species.
Candidiasis;5;Candida yeasts are common in most people.
Candidiasis;6;The yeast is usually controlled in the body.
Candidiasis;7;When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.
Candidiasis;8;A weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop.
Candidiasis;9;HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.

Jet lag;1;Jet lag is a physiological condition, often occurring when humans travel from one time zone to another.
Jet lag;2;It happens because of the time difference between two places.
Jet lag;3;Some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do.
Jet lag;4;If the departure time (the original body clock) is not the same as the destination time, jet lag can occur.
Jet lag;5;Traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west.
Jet lag;6;That is because a cycle of the human's biological time is usually more than 24 hours, and going east makes the day shorter, which is a more difficult adjustment.
Jet lag;7;Jet lag can have several symptoms.
Jet lag;8;It usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia.
Jet lag;9;Also, headache, depression, even nausea may strike people.
Jet lag;10;Sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment.
Jet lag;11;Using caffeine (such as in tea or coffee) is helpful, either in the morning when going westward or in the afternoon when going eastward.
Jet lag;12;The hormone melatonin is said to help people sleep.
Jet lag;13;Also, doing things like changing sleeping patterns several days before departure may help people adjust to the new time zone.

Overweight;1;Overweight is the condition of a person when they have more fat in their body than what is thought as to be normal for their height.
Overweight;2;To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index.
Overweight;3;People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight.
Overweight;4;Anything above 30 is said to be obese (very overweight).
Overweight;5;Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more.
Overweight;6;In 1998 this changed.
Overweight;7;Being overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes.
Overweight;8;Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight.
Overweight;9;In 2006 Adams et al.
Overweight;10;estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people.
Overweight;11;Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought.
Overweight;12;A 2013 review of 97 Pubmed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight.
Overweight;13;Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick.
Overweight;14;51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy.
Overweight;15;Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women.
Overweight;16;Doctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health.
Overweight;17;People usually try to lose weight by eating less.
Overweight;18;This is called 'dieting'.
Overweight;19;They may exercise too.
Overweight;20;Dieting is often ineffective.
Overweight;21;41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began.
Overweight;22;Some people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass.
Overweight;23;Animals can also be overweight.
Overweight;24;Overweight is not just associated with bad health.
Overweight;25;People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad.
Overweight;26;Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this.
Overweight;27;This is called fatphobia.
Overweight;28;More than 1.4 billion adults are overweight in the world.
Overweight;29;The amount of overweight people is increasing.
Migraine;1;A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head.
Migraine;2;The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything.
Migraine;3;While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does.
Migraine;4;There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.
Migraine;5;Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises.
Migraine;6;"Some people have "" auras "" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different."
Migraine;7;They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all.
Migraine;8;Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes.
Migraine;9;Migraines can last a long time.
Migraine;10;Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours.
Migraine;11;Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine (EM).
Migraine;12;If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine (CM).
Migraine;13;Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time.
Migraine;14;Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later.
Migraine;15;Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine.
Migraine;16;Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines.
Migraine;17;"CGRP stands for "" calcitonin gene-related peptide "" ."
Migraine;18;CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain.
Migraine;19;What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain.
Migraine;20;There are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines.
Migraine;21;Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines.
Migraine;22;For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack.
Migraine;23;In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or fluctuates (goes up and down).
Migraine;24;The World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.
Migraine;25;Acephalgic migraine, also called a silent migraine, is a kind of migraine with aura but without the head pain.
Migraine;26;This type of migraine usually starts sometime during middle-age, which is after a person is 40 years old, and becomes more common as a person gets older.
Migraine;27;Unlike other migraines, males have acephalgic migraines more often then females do.
Migraine;28;Basilar-type migraine is a type of migraine with aura that causes headache usually in the occipital region of the brain with neurological symptoms that is believed to come from the brainstem, occipital cortex, and cerebellum and/or affects both hemispheres of the brain at the same time.
Migraine;29;Most people who have basilar-type migraine also experience migraines with aura without the basilar symptoms.
Migraine;30;This type of migraine usually more common in people under age 20 and young females.
Migraine;31;Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a type of migraine with aura that also may cause paralysis on one side of the body.
Migraine;32;When the migraine stops, the person can move normally again.
Migraine;33;Retinal migraine has repeated times of vision loss in one eye, that may happen before or during a headache.
Migraine;34;People who have retinal migraines usually have a history of having one of the other more common types of migraine.
Migraine;35;Menstrual migraine or catamenial migraine is a type of migraine that happens perimenstrually, which means around the time of menstruation during a woman's monthly menstrual cycle.
Migraine;36;Menstrual migraine is usually a migraine without aura, but sometimes a menstrual migraine with aura happens.
Migraine;37;About 7%-14% of women have migraines exclusively at the time of menstruation.
Migraine;38;These are considered true menstrual migraines.
Migraine;39;Most female migraneurs experience migraine attacks at all times during the menstrual cycle, with an increased number perimenstrually.
Migraine;40;These are referred to as menstrually related or menstrually triggered migraine.
Migraine;41;Both true menstrual migraines and menstrually related migraines are categorized under menstrual migraine.
Migraine;42;The role of estrogen   ::Estrogen is a hormone that is mostly made in a woman's ovaries.
Migraine;43;There are three types of estrogen: estrone, estradiol and estriol.
Migraine;44;In women who have migraines it is usually connected with their menstruation cycle.
Migraine;45;About 60% of women have these menstrual or menstrually-related migraines and the main trigger is believed to be reduced circulating estrogen levels, i.e.
Migraine;46;the amount of estrogen in the body, specifically estradiol.
Migraine;47;In some cases, fluctuation (going up and down) in the amount of circulating estrogen levels may trigger a migraine, i.e.
Migraine;48;not only too little but sometimes too much estrogen may trigger a migraine.
Migraine;49;Childhood periodic syndromes are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have.
Migraine;50;When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they become adults.
Migraine;51;Abdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the periumbilical area.
Migraine;52;Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults.
Migraine;53;"Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight."
Migraine;54;BPVC causes vertigo.
Migraine;55;Cyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting.
Migraine;56;CVS happens more often in children, but it can occur at any age.
Migraine;57;Episodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month.
Migraine;58;When compared to persons with episodic migraine, those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability.
Migraine;59;"Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke."
Migraine;60;About 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income.
Migraine;61;(The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)   Aura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache.
Migraine;62;About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura.
Migraine;63;The symptoms may include visual problems such as scotomas (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.
Migraine;64;), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.
Migraine;65;Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: skotos): a blind spot or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field.
Migraine;67;: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is.
Migraine;68;Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either absolute where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, relative with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma.
Migraine;69;"Scotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the fortification scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort."
Migraine;70;Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights.
Migraine;71;In medicine a factor is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening.
Migraine;72;If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a risk factor.
Migraine;73;A trigger factor or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin.
Migraine;74;";Risk factors   Gender: Women are three times more likely to have migraine headaches than men."
Migraine;75;Family history: A person has more of a chance of getting migraines if one of their parents has had them.
Migraine;76;The International Headache Consortium are doctors from a lot of different countries who study headaches and what causes them.
Migraine;77;They have found four genetic variations - these are differences in a persons genes - that are risk factors for migraine without aura in people who have these differences.
Migraine;78;Two of these genetic variations had already been shown to play a role in migraine with aura.
Migraine;79;Hormonal changes   Obesity: has shown to be a risk factor for chronic migraine not episodic migraine.
Migraine;80;";Triggers   Dietary habits: fasting, dehydration, or skipping meals."
Migraine;81;Diet: Eating certain foods such as those that contain tyramine which is found in certain foods and is the end result of the natural breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine.
Migraine;82;Various food contain tyramine such as aged cheeses, smoked fish, some kinds of beer.
Migraine;83;Tyramine as a trigger for migraine is thought to effect less than 10% of people with migraines.
Migraine;84;There are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms.
Migraine;85;The diagnosis of migraine is a clinical diagnosis which means it is based upon a person's medical history that a person reports to the doctor.
Migraine;86;The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the headache history includes information such as:   Does anyone else in the person's family have medical problems.
Migraine;87;If so what kind?
Migraine;88;What are all the symptoms you have?
Migraine;89;At what age did the symptoms first start?
Migraine;90;How often do the headaches and/or other symptoms occur?
Migraine;91;How long do the symptoms last?
Migraine;92;Where is the pain?
Migraine;93;Unilateral: either left or right side of the head - bilateral: both left and right sides   Differential diagnoses are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms.
Migraine;94;Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them.
Migraine;95;Brain tumor   Cluster headache   Sinusitis   Stroke   Subarachnoid hemorrhage   Tension headache   Vascular pathologies: medical conditions that effect the vascular system such as arteriovenous malformation   Often, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders.
Migraine;96;"These other disorders are the "" comorbid disorders "" or "" comorbidities "" ."
Migraine;97;There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines.
Migraine;98;The treatment and prognosis (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.
Migraine;99;:Asthma   :Raynaud’s disease: is a circulatory disorder in which the smaller arteries that supply blood to the extremities - most often the hands, but it may also affect the, toes, the tip of the nose and the ears - become narrower reducing blood flow.
Migraine;100;This causes the extremities to become numb and to be cooler than the core body temperature.
Migraine;101;It can be triggered by exposure to stress and cold.
Migraine;102;:Epilepsy   :Fibromyalgia   Comorbid psychiatric conditions   :Major depressive disorder   :Anxiety   :Bipolar disorder   In medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines).
Migraine;103;Chronic migraine   Status migrainosus is the term used to describe a severe migraine attack which lasts more than 72 hours straight.
Migraine;104;Persistent aura without stroke   Migraine stroke   Migraine-triggered seizures   In medicine epidemiology is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to.
Migraine;105;Migraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys.
Migraine;106;By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do.
Migraine;107;The number of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older.
Migraine;108;Between 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines.
Migraine;109;Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress.
Migraine;110;About two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.
Migraine;111;Symptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history.
Migraine;112;The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E.
Migraine;113;A treatment for migraine can be found in the Ebers Papyrus, an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them.
Migraine;114;In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E.
Migraine;115;"migraine is refereed to as "" suffering in half the head "" ."
Migraine;116;Another remedy for suffering in half the head.
Migraine;117;The skull of a catfish fried in oil.
Migraine;118;Anoint the head herewith.-Ebers Papyrus,1552 B.C.E.
Migraine;119;The Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed heterocrania is considered a description of migraine.
Dengue fever;1;"Dengue fever (pronounced "" DEN-gi "" ) is a tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus."
Dengue fever;2;People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes.
Dengue fever;3;Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking.
Dengue fever;4;Most people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough.
Dengue fever;5;However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.
Dengue fever;6;These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.
Dengue fever;7;There is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;8;There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever.
Dengue fever;9;"Doctors can only provide "" supportive care, "" which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms."
Dengue fever;10;Since the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever.
Dengue fever;11;Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world.
Dengue fever;12;It is common in more than 110 countries.
Dengue fever;13;Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.
Dengue fever;14;Most people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever).
Dengue fever;15;About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker.
Dengue fever;16;A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them.
Dengue fever;17;After a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick.
Dengue fever;18;(This is called the virus's incubation period.)
Dengue fever;19;Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days.
Dengue fever;20;Often, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold.
Dengue fever;21;However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.
Dengue fever;22;Dengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.
Dengue fever;23;In the febrile stage, people with dengue usually have a high fever.
Dengue fever;24;"( "" Febrile "" means that a person has a fever.)"
Dengue fever;25;The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
Dengue fever;26;Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back.
Dengue fever;27;During the febrile stage, people may also have:   Pain all over their bodies   A headache   A rash (this happens in 50% to 80% of people who get sick from dengue)   Petechiae (small red spots on the skin).
Dengue fever;28;These are caused by capillaries (which carry blood) breaking.
Dengue fever;29;This makes the blood leak out and show up under the skin.
Dengue fever;30;Small amounts of bleeding from the mucous membranes in the mouth and nose   The febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days.
Dengue fever;31;This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone.
Dengue fever;32;In about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a critical stage next.
Dengue fever;33;"( "" Critical "" means "" very dangerous. """
Dengue fever;34;) The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days.
Dengue fever;35;During this stage, plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels.
Dengue fever;36;The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen.
Dengue fever;37;This is a serious problem for a few reasons.
Dengue fever;38;Plasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body.
Dengue fever;39;Every part of the body needs these things to survive.
Dengue fever;40;If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs.
Dengue fever;41;Without these things, the organs cannot work normally.
Dengue fever;42;This is called dengue shock syndrome.
Dengue fever;43;Plasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding).
Dengue fever;44;If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding.
Dengue fever;45;With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract.
Dengue fever;46;When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever;47;"( "" Hemorrhage "" means "" dangerous bleeding. """
Dengue fever;48;)   The recovery stage is when the patient's body is overcoming the disease process.
Dengue fever;49;In this stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream.
Dengue fever;50;This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days.
Dengue fever;51;During this stage, people with dengue often feel much better.
Dengue fever;52;However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate.
Dengue fever;53;Serious problems can also happen during the recovery stage.
Dengue fever;54;"If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, this can cause "" fluid overload. """
Dengue fever;55;This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems.
Dengue fever;56;Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior).
Dengue fever;57;Every once in a while, dengue can affect other systems in the body.
Dengue fever;58;For example, dengue can cause:   Altered mental status: This happens in 0.5% to 6% of people with very bad dengue fever.
Dengue fever;59;It can happen when the dengue virus causes an infection in the brain.
Dengue fever;60;It can also happen when important organs, like the liver, are not working correctly because of dengue.
Dengue fever;61;Neurological disorders: These are problems with the brain and the nerves, like Guillain–Barré syndrome and Post-dengue acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
Dengue fever;62;Infection of the heart, or sudden liver failure (these are very uncommon).
Dengue fever;63;Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;64;In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus.
Dengue fever;65;Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus.
Dengue fever;66;Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.
Dengue fever;67;Dengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus, especially the Aedes aegypti species of mosquito.
Dengue fever;68;Aides aegypti is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals.
Dengue fever;69;A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite.
Dengue fever;70;Sometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans.
Dengue fever;71;If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood.
Dengue fever;72;"After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or "" spit "" )."
Dengue fever;73;Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;74;When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue.
Dengue fever;75;A person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus.
Dengue fever;76;In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue.
Dengue fever;77;The dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born.
Dengue fever;78;This is called vertical transmission.
Dengue fever;79;Dengue is usually not spread in any other ways.
Dengue fever;80;Once a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells.
Dengue fever;81;(The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.)
Dengue fever;82;As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself.
Dengue fever;83;The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body.
Dengue fever;84;These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue.
Dengue fever;85;If a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body.
Dengue fever;86;Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow).
Dengue fever;87;The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally.
Dengue fever;88;This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen.
Dengue fever;89;Babies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick.
Dengue fever;90;Women are more likely than men to get very sick.
Dengue fever;91;Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma.
Dengue fever;92;There are four different types of the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;93;Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life.
Dengue fever;94;However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time.
Dengue fever;95;If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever;96;Usually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue.
Dengue fever;97;However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses.
Dengue fever;98;"The World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if:   He has a fever; AND   He has two of these symptoms:   #Nausea and vomiting;   #A rash;   #Pain all over the body;   #A low number of white blood cells; or   #A positive tourniquet test."
Dengue fever;99;(To do this test, a doctor wraps a blood pressure cuff around a person's arm for five minutes, then counts any red spots on the skin.
Dengue fever;100;If the person has many spots, they are more likely to have dengue fever.)
Dengue fever;101;The World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever.
Dengue fever;102;Some blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever.
Dengue fever;103;The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood.
Dengue fever;104;A low number of platelets can also signal dengue.
Dengue fever;105;"Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus."
Dengue fever;106;However, these special tests are expensive.
Dengue fever;107;Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines.
Dengue fever;108;It can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya.
Dengue fever;109;Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world.
Dengue fever;110;Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease.
Dengue fever;111;Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead.
Dengue fever;112;In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever.
Dengue fever;113;Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler.
Dengue fever;114;It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories.
Dengue fever;115;In 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever.
Dengue fever;116;However, the older system often is still used.
Dengue fever;117;The WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories:   Undifferentiated fever   Dengue fever   Dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever;118;This was then divided into four stages, called grades I-IV:   #In Grade I, the person has a fever.
Dengue fever;119;He also bruises easily or has a positive tourniquet test.
Dengue fever;120;#In Grade II, the person bleeds into the skin and other parts of the body.
Dengue fever;121;##	In Grade III, the person shows signs of circulatory shock.
Dengue fever;122;This is called dengue shock syndrome.
Dengue fever;123;##	In Grade IV, the person has shock so severe that his blood pressure and heartbeat cannot be felt.
Dengue fever;124;This is a more serious version of dengue shock syndrome.
Dengue fever;125;In 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types:   Uncomplicated: People who just have the febrile stage of dengue fever, and never go into the critical phase.
Dengue fever;126;They get better on their own or just need basic medical help.
Dengue fever;127;Severe: People who have symptoms that could kill them, or have serious complications from dengue.
Dengue fever;128;There are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;129;The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population.
Dengue fever;130;The best way to control the mosquito is to get rid of its (the places it lives) The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move).
Dengue fever;131;Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay its eggs, to prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can:   Wear clothing that fully covers their skin   Use bug spray   Use mosquito netting when they are resting.
Dengue fever;132;"The WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an "" Integrated Vector Control "" program) that includes five different parts:   #	Advocacy, people working together, and legislation (laws) should be used to make public health organizations and communities stronger."
Dengue fever;133;#	All parts of society should work together.
Dengue fever;134;This includes the public sector (like the government), the private sector (like businesses and corporations), and the health care field.
Dengue fever;135;#	All ways of controlling disease should be brought together.
Dengue fever;136;#	Decisions should be make based on evidence.
Dengue fever;137;This will help make sure that the things that are done to address dengue are helpful.
Dengue fever;138;#	Areas where dengue is a problem should be given help, so that they can build their abilities to respond well to the disease on their own.
Dengue fever;139;There are no specific treatments for dengue fever.
Dengue fever;140;No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus.
Dengue fever;141;"Health workers can give "" supportive treatment "" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better."
Dengue fever;142;Different people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms.
Dengue fever;143;Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better.
Dengue fever;144;Treating dehydration is very important.
Dengue fever;145;Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein.
Dengue fever;146;Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two.
Dengue fever;147;Doctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain.
Dengue fever;148;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely.
Dengue fever;149;People with bad dengue may need blood transfusions.
Dengue fever;150;Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever).
Dengue fever;151;When people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body).
Dengue fever;152;If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid.
Dengue fever;153;Most people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward.
Dengue fever;154;Without treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 100) die from dengue.
Dengue fever;155;With good treatment, less than 1% die.
Dengue fever;156;However, 26% of people with severe dengue die.
Dengue fever;157;Dengue is common in more than 110 countries.
Dengue fever;158;Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world.
Dengue fever;159;It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths around the world each year.
Dengue fever;160;However, the World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be.
Dengue fever;161;"It calls dengue one of 16 "" neglected tropical diseases "" - diseases which do not get enough attention."
Dengue fever;162;In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost.
Dengue fever;163;This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis.
Dengue fever;164;However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures.
Dengue fever;165;Dengue is becoming much more common around the world.
Dengue fever;166;It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods.
Dengue fever;167;In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960.
Dengue fever;168;Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because:   More people are living in cities.
Dengue fever;169;There are more people in the world.
Dengue fever;170;The world's population is growing.
Dengue fever;171;More people are travelling internationally (between countries).
Dengue fever;172;Global warming is thought to play a part in the increase in dengue.
Dengue fever;173;Dengue happens most around the equator.
Dengue fever;174;2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens.
Dengue fever;175;70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific.
Dengue fever;176;In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling.
Dengue fever;177;In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria.
Dengue fever;178;Dengue fever is probably a very old disease.
Dengue fever;179;An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue.
Dengue fever;180;"The book talked about a "" water poison "" that had to do with flying insects."

Coeliac disease;1;Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in people when the indigestion of Gluten leads to problems in the body.
Coeliac disease;2;If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten (for example, wheat, rye, barley), cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine.
Coeliac disease;3;This means that they cannot digest (eat) food properly, making them unable to have enough energy, vitamins, or minerals.
Coeliac disease;4;Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly.
Coeliac disease;5;People with coeliac disease often lose weight.
Coeliac disease;6;They are also frequently tired.
Coeliac disease;7;People with coeliac disease often have bloating and pain in their abdominal (stomach) area, diarrhoea (watery stools) or steatorrhea (fat in their stools).
Coeliac disease;8;These symptoms can lead to flatulence.
Coeliac disease;9;Their stomachs also start to hurt and they might suffer from joint pains, seizures, rashes, fatigue, slowness in growth and puberty, loss in weight, loss of bone density and fertility issues.
Coeliac disease;10;To relieve the effects of coeliac disease, one must stop eating gluten.
Coeliac disease;11;There are no medicines or cure that can stop Coeliac disease.
Coeliac disease;12;To get fully better, it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten, during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover.
Coeliac disease;13;They must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition.
Coeliac disease;14;Coeliac disease is genetic and relatives (such a children, siblings, parents) with this disease have a 1 in 10 chance of developing Coeliac disease.
Coeliac disease;15;This means that the person affected by it is born with genes that cause the immune system to react poorly to gluten.
Coeliac disease;16;However, Coeliac disease is not always present during childhood.
Coeliac disease;17;It can be triggered as an adult by an event such as pregnancy (hormone shifts) or illness.
Coeliac disease;18;To find out if a person has Coeliac disease, doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten.
Coeliac disease;19;The protein that attacks the intestine is called an antibody.
Coeliac disease;20;Antibodies are produced by white blood cells, and they normally stop illnesses from growing in the body, but in the case of coeliac disease, one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness.
Coeliac disease;21;Doctors can also look into the patient's intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope.
Coeliac disease;22;This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged, because of coeliac disease.

Claustrophobia;1;Claustrophobia is a fear of narrow or closed places.
Claustrophobia;2;It is an anxiety disorder and often results in panic attack.
Kleptomania;1;"Kleptomania (, kleptomania, "" to steal "" , μανία, "" mania "" ) is an impulse control disorder."
Kleptomania;2;It is mental disorder with a frequent urge of stealing.
Kleptomania;3;Kleptomaniacs often steal many of the same thing and hoard, throw away or give away the things they steal.
Kleptomania;4;Some may not be aware that they have committed the theft.
Kleptomania;5;It is often found in people who have other mental disorders, such as depression, panic attacks, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction.
Kleptomania;6;The condition is more common in females, and especially those with bulimia.
Anal fissure;1;An anal fissure, or fissura ani, is a fissure (a small tear) in the anal canal.
Anal fissure;2;Patients typically complain of sharp anal pain during and after defecation, lasting minuters or hours .
Anal fissure;3;This small wound can sometimes bleed a little bit during or after defecation.
Anal fissure;4;It's not completely clear what causes an anal fissure.
Anal fissure;5;It is possibly caused by constipation, too much strain on the anal sphincter (the circular muscle of the anus), reduced blood circulation, the skin is not made dry enough after taking a shower or swimming, the skin has been stretched too much, pregnancy, giving birth, and not changing a baby's diaper in time.
Anal fissure;6;After the anal fissure closes, it takes 6 weeks to 3 months before the wound is healed completely.
Anal fissure;7;In this period the fissure easily opens again.
Anal fissure;8;Therefore, the wound can return repeatedly .
Anal fissure;9;A doctor can prescribe several products to treat the anal fissure.
Anal fissure;10;"For example, a pain relieving ointment or suppository (an anal medication); a laxative (that makes it easier to go to the toilet); zinc-ointment (this will protect the skin and contract it, so it will heal faster) ."
Anal fissure;11;Further more a doctor can give advice about taking care of the wound and improve digestion and defecation.
Anal fissure;12;Most fissure are acute, lasting about 4-6 weeks .
Anal fissure;13;The anal fissure becomes chronic and will not go away if it lasts for more than 6 weeks.
Anal fissure;14;In such cases medical surgery can be a solution.
Anal fissure;15;The circular muscle of the anus is usually cut or stretched.
Anal fissure;16;Also an injection with botox in the muscle can have a positive result.
Anal fissure;17;The anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing, for example during defecation.
Anal fissure;18;The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return.
Anal fissure;19;The advice includes the following tips.
Anal fissure;20;As long as the fissure is open (a painful, small tear next to the anus which can bleed a little) the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide (protects and contracts) and pramocaïne (relieves pain and itching) on and around the fissure (in Europe available without prescription as Nestosyl).
Anal fissure;21;Use toilet your finger with a glove to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap.
Anal fissure;22;This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again.
Anal fissure;23;Besides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation.
Anal fissure;24;The longer the faeces is in the intestine, the more liquid will be withdrawal.
Anal fissure;25;Because of this, the faeces will become harder and get more volume, and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again.
Anal fissure;26;Patients are advized to eat fibres every day (for example: unpolished rice, muesli, whole grain bread, dried apricots, figs, dates, prunes, saltless nuts, beans, peas, etc.
Anal fissure;27;"); to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day; to use a little bit of butter or oil every day; to drink enough during the day; and to exercise every day."
Anal fissure;28;The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation (possible: white bread, white pasta/pizza/noodles, eggs, cheese, sugar, coffee, chocolate, etc.).
Anal fissure;29;If necessary, one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread.
Anal fissure;30;Patients should not postpone going to the toilet.
Anal fissure;31;While waiting, the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus, which causes a pressure.
Anal fissure;32;Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while.
Anal fissure;33;When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet, the best thing is to go immediately.
Anal fissure;34;While sitting on the toilet, the patient has to press as little as possible, but instead relax the circular muscle.
Anal fissure;35;As long as the wound is not healed, taking a daily bath with soda (sodium carbonate) can give relief.
Anal fissure;36;Further more that will keep the wound clean.
Anal fissure;37;Sit in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water for 20 minutes, 2 or 3 times a day.
Anal fissure;38;This is called a sitz bath.
Anal fissure;39;It relaxes the tissue and helps relax the anal muscle .
Anal fissure;40;It's very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed.
Anal fissure;41;The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily.
Anal fissure;42;Some patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus.
Anal fissure;43;For example, olive oil or sunflower oil.
Anal fissure;44;The skin softens and will not tear or crack as easily.
Anal fissure;45;Always remind hygiene.
Anal fissure;46;If the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open, the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation.
Anal fissure;47;The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again.
Anal fissure;48;One can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper, baby wipes, or instead use warm water to clean himself after bowel movement.
Anal fissure;49;While following all mentioned tips and advice, do not forget the good principles of hygiene.
Anal fissure;50;These recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure.
Anal fissure;51;If there is any doubt, especially when there is blood in the stool, please consult a doctor   .
Nystagmus;1;"Nystagmus, often called "" dancing eyes "" , is an eye condition which causes uncontrolled, rapid, jerky, movement of the eyes, usually from side to side, but sometimes up and down or in a circular motion."
Nystagmus;2;Most people with nystagmus have poor vision.
Nystagmus;3;It causes problems in education, employment and many social situations.
Nystagmus;4;Nystagmus cannot be fixed by spectacles or contact lenses, although many people with nystagmus wear glasses or contact lenses to correct other eye problems.
Nystagmus;5;There are two types of Nystagmus.
Nystagmus;6;The first is Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (INS) which some people have at birth.
Nystagmus;7;The second type is known as acquired nystagmus which has a number of causes including:   Alcohol   Drugs, especially sedatives   Head injury   Inner ear problems like labyrinthitis or Meniere's disease   Thiamine deficiency   Vitamin B12 deficiency   Diseases that can affect the brain's control of the eyes such as a tumor, or multiple sclerosis.
Nystagmus;8;People with nystagmus do not normally see the world as moving, but they do occasionally.
Nystagmus;9;They have poor distance vision, but most have good close vision.
Nystagmus;10;Nystagmus is not painful.
Nystagmus;11;Between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 2000 people have nystagmus.
Nystagmus;12;Nystagmus can be hereditary, but it can also be a result of something else.
Nystagmus;13;Most people with nystagmus can see well enough to drive an automobile   Nystagmus does not get worse with age.
Nystagmus;14;There are currently no cures for nystagmus, but UK Nystagmus Network supports and encourages medical and other research into this complex condition.

Sleep apnea;1;Sleep apnea (or Sleep apnoea) is a problem certain people have: When they sleep, they may stop breathing for short periods.
Sleep apnea;2;These periods can last for 10 seconds or more.
Sleep apnea;3;3-4 breaths are missed.
Sleep apnea;4;As a result of this, those affected are often tired during the day.
Sleep apnea;5;Mainly because such people also tend to have microsleep, they should not drive vehicles.
Sleep apnea;6;Sleep apnea is a treatable disease.
Sleep apnea;7;loud snoring   lowering of concentration   People can ask their partner or family member if they are breathing strangely when they are sleeping.
Sleep apnea;8;In case the patient is obese, losing weight improves sleep apnea.
Sleep apnea;9;Fixing the environment where they sleep   Continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP)   Expiratory positive airway pressure(EPAP)   Circular breathing technique (It makes muscle of the upper airway stronger, so airway remains opening when sleeping.
Sleep apnea;10;Playing didgeridoo is good for learning this technique.
Sleep apnea;11;Diseases which may complicate sleep apnea are: obesity, high blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia, arrhythmia, polyemia, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes etc.
Sleep apnea;12;Sleep apnea is a risk factor of arteriosclerotic disease.
Sleep apnea;13;Intolerable sleepiness of daytime   Depression   Less concentration   Loud snoring   Night frequent urination   Headache when waking up   When there are no house mates, it may take time to discover this condition.

Retrograde amnesia;1;Retrograde amnesia is a type of amnesia when someone cannot remember what happened before the event that caused the memory loss (such as a head injury).
Retrograde amnesia;2;This is different from anterograde amnesia, when someone cannot remember what happened after the event.
Melanoma;1;Melanoma () is a malignant tumor of melanocytes which are found predominantly in skin but also in the bowel and the eye (see uveal melanoma).
Melanoma;2;It is one of the rarer types of skin cancer but causes the majority of skin cancer related deaths.
Melanoma;3;Malignant melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer.
Melanoma;4;It is due to uncontrolled growth of pigment cells, called melanocytes.
Melanoma;5;According to a report by the WHO, about 48,000 people die of melanoma every year.
Melanoma;6;Melanoma is prominent in New Zealand and Australia due to the hole in the ozone layer and the many beaches.
Melanoma;7;Melanoma that has metastasised (spread beyond the initial primary tumor) is treated with Dacarbizine or Interleukin-2, also known as Proleukin, in many cases.
Melanoma;8;Interleukin-2 has a response rate of up to sixteen-percent.
Melanoma;9;Recent studies support the use of a new drug called Ipilimumab, which appears to prolong survival in metastatic melanoma patients.
Melanoma;10;Percutaneous liver perfusion with a chemotherapeutic agent known as melphalan can prolong progression free survival in patients with melanoma metastatic to the liver, although the majority of patients in this study had melanoma starting in the eye rather than the skin.
Mania;1;Mania is a type of mood.
Mania;2;Mania is usually a symptom of a medical problem or a mental illness.
Mania;3;A person with mania is described as manic.
Mania;4;When people are manic, they usually have much more energy than usual.
Mania;5;They often have very strong emotions, and their moods may change very quickly.
Mania;6;"The word "" mania "" comes from the Greek language (μwordsανία means mania)."
Mania;7;"That word comes from μαίνομαι (mainomai), which means "" to rage "" or "" to be furious "" (very angry)."
Mania;8;Mania is a symptom, not an illness by itself.
Mania;9;Many different things can cause mania.
Mania;10;These things include illegal drugs and brain tumors.
Mania;11;However, most of the time, mania happens in people with bipolar disorder.
Mania;12;Bipolar disorder causes periods of mania that switch off with periods of depression.
Mania;13;Like with other symptoms, mania can be mild (not very bad), severe (very bad), or anywhere in between.
Mania;14;"Mild mania is usually called "" hypomania. """
Mania;15;Very bad mania can cause psychosis, with hallucinations and delusions.
Mania;16;In some cases, people with mania may need to be hospitalized so they do not hurt themselves or other people.
Mania;17;On the other hand, many people with mania and hypomania have special creativity and artistic talents.
Mania;18;The most common symptoms of mania are:   A mood that is either euphoric (very happy) or irritable (easily irritated or angered)   Being very talkative.
Mania;19;This includes talking very quickly (pressured speech) and jumping from one idea to the next very quickly (flight of ideas).
Mania;20;Having an unusual amount of energy   Not needing sleep   Being very hyper   Other symptoms of mania can include:   Racing thoughts, which can sometimes make it impossible for the person to concentrate on anything other than their thoughts   Acting impulsively (doing things without thinking them through), like spending a lot of money or having unsafe sex.
Mania;21;People are more likely to put themselves in danger when they are manic.
Mania;22;"Physical symptoms, like sweating, pacing, and losing weight   Hypersexuality (wanting to have sex much more than usual)   Delusions, like:   Delusions of grandeur: The person believes he is very important - for example, that he knows everything, or is famous, all-powerful, or very wealthy   Delusions of potential: The person believes he can do things he cannot really do (for example, believing he can build a house on his own, when he has never built anything before)   Delusions of persecution: The person believes other people are "" out to get him "" and are causing his problems on purpose   In the United States, a book called The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, is used to diagnose mental illnesses."
Mania;23;"According to the latest version of the DSM, the DSM-5, a person is having a "" manic episode "" if all of these things are true:   The person's mood has been unusually euphoric or irritable for seven days or more   The person's mood changes are not caused by illegal drugs, medicine, or a medical illness   The person's mania is:   #Causing them obvious problems at work, with family, or friends; OR   #Making them psychotic; OR   #Making them a danger to self or others   In addition, the person must also have three or more of these symptoms:   Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity (the person feels like he is very important and special)   Needs only a little sleep to feel rested   More talkative than usual; or the person seems like they have to keep talking (pressured speech)   Jumping from one idea to another; or the person feels like their thoughts are racing   Increase in "" goal-directed activity, "" like taking on big new projects; or "" psychomotor agitation "" (moving around a lot, unable to sit still)   Being easily distracted (the person's attention is drawn too easily to things that are not important)   Doing a lot of activities that have a high risk of turning out badly (for example, spending a lot of money; going on sexual adventures)   The ICD-10 is the World Health Organization's system for classifying health problems."
Mania;24;"It describes a manic episode this way:   The person's mood is euphoric, and can change from being happy and carefree, to "" almost uncontrollable excitement ""   The person has an unusual amount of energy and is always doing some kind of activity   The person seems like they have to keep talking   The person does not seem to need sleep   The person cannot pay attention to anything, and gets distracted very easily   Often, the person feels very important, is much more confident than usual, and has unreasonable ideas about what they can do (for example, they may feel like nothing can stop them from getting what they want)   The person does not have normal social inhibitions (a sense of what is right and appropriate to do around other people)."
Mania;25;This can lead to behavior that is inappropriate, reckless, and unusual for the person.
Mania;26;Mental illness   Mania is usually a symptom of mental illness, most often bipolar disorder.
Mania;27;A diagnosis of type I bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder) can be made based on a single manic episode.
Mania;28;This is the most common cause of mania.
Mania;29;However, if a person is hypomanic, they may have type II bipolar disorder or cyclothymia.
Mania;30;Also, if a person has psychosis that lasts longer than their mania, they may have schizoaffective disorder.
Mania;31;Medical causes   Mania is usually caused by a mental illness.
Mania;32;However, some medical illnesses can cause symptoms of mania.
Mania;33;Some doctors use the mnemonic E-MANIC to remember the possible medical causes of mania:   Endocrine: Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or Cushing's syndrome can cause mania.
Mania;34;(These are all problems with hormones in the body)   Medications: Many different medications can have mania as side effects.
Mania;35;"These medications include amphetamines (often used to treat Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD); antidepressants; corticosteroids; opiate painkillers, and many others."
Mania;36;Abuse of alcohol or illegal drugs: Alcohol and many other drugs can cause mania.
Mania;37;These drugs include cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), inhalants, opiates, anabolic steroids, and MDMA (Ecstasy).
Mania;38;Neurologic problems: Many different problems with the brain can cause mania.
Mania;39;For example, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease can all cause manic symptoms.
Mania;40;Infection: Infections in the brain can cause mania.
Mania;41;Examples include meningitis, brain infections caused by HIV/AIDS, and neurosyphilis (the last stage of syphilis, when the disease reaches the brain)   Cardiovascular causes and Cerebrovascular accidents (strokes)   Not having enough vitamin B-12 (vitamin B-12 deficiency) can also cause mania and psychosis.
Mania;42;If mania is caused by a medical problem, the best thing to do is to treat that medical problem.
Mania;43;If mania is caused by a mental illness, the best treatment is a combination of medicines and psychotherapy (talking with a therapist or counselor).
Mania;44;Doctors usually treat mania with a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medicines.
Mania;45;While taking these medicines, the patient should see their doctor regularly to be checked for side effects.
Mania;46;When the symptoms of mania have ended, long-term treatment then focuses on preventative treatment.
Mania;47;The goal of this kind of treatment is to prevent periods of mania or depression from happening.
Mania;48;Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy.
Mania;49;Medication works best for bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses, when it is combined with other treatments like psychotherapy.

Urolagnia;1;Urolagnia (also urophilia, undinism) is a paraphilia where people gain sexual pleasure from urine and/or urination.
Urolagnia;2;The term has origins in the Greek Language (from ouron, urine, and lagneia, lust).
Urolagnia;3;Those who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people, or being urinated on.
Urolagnia;4;The practice of drinking the urine is called urophagia, although this word also applies to non-sexual situations.
Urolagnia;5;People who practice urolagnia may participate in urolagnia as part of a domination and submission scene, though not all sexual activity involving urine is so.
Urolagnia;6;These activities are often described with the slang terms golden showers, water sports, or piss play.
Urolagnia;7;Urolagnia is sometimes associated with omorashi, but omorashi is usually described in Western culture using terms such as bladder desperation or panty wetting.
Urolagnia;8;In New Zealand, publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia, whether in print or online, is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison.
Myelodysplastic syndrome;1;The Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of diseases and conditions that affect how blood is made.
Myelodysplastic syndrome;2;These diseases were formerly known as preleukemia, mostly because sometimes they can lead to leukemia.
Myelodysplastic syndrome;3;Often, its name is shortened to MDS.
Myelodysplastic syndrome;4;Myelodysplastic syndromes affect the bone marrow stem cells.
Myelodysplastic syndrome;5;The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells, but ones that have been modified genetically.

Swine influenza;9;The director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that the United States' cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses—North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe.
Swine influenza;10;A new strain of swine influenza A called H1N1 was responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans.
Swine influenza;11;In 2009, the government of Egypt ordered over 300,000 pigs killed to prevent the spread of H1N1, even though experts said the pigs were not going to spread H1N1 anyway.
Swine influenza;12;Most of the pigs' owners were not paid for their dead pigs.

Personality disorder;31;Cluster C is the anxious or fearful group of personality disorders.
Personality disorder;32;They are:   Avoidant personality disorder   Dependent personality disorder   Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder   The World Health Organization has a different way of describing personality disorders.
Personality disorder;33;It makes use of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).
Mood disorder;1;A mood disorder or affective disorder is a type of mental illness where the main problem is the person's mood.
Mood disorder;2;The two main kinds of mood disorder are depressive disorders (like major depressive disorder) and bipolar disorder.
Mood disorder;3;Some other mood disorders can be caused by using drugs.
Mood disorder;4;Most people who have mood disorders also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.

Ischemic colitis;1;Ischemic colitis (also called Colonic ischemia) is a medical condition in which inflammation and injury cause an inadequite blood supply to the large instestine.
Ischemic colitis;2;It occurs more often in older people.
Ischemic colitis;3;In fact, more than 90% of cases occur in people over the age of 60.
Ischemic colitis;4;Ischemic colitis is the most common form of bowel ischemia.
Ischemic colitis;5;Abdominal pain   Lower digestive bleeding   Diarrhea   Fever higher than 100.4°F (38°C)   Vomiting   Most cases of ischemic colitis are mild and will get better on their own.
Ischemic colitis;6;IV fluids are givin to patients to treat dehydration.
Ischemic colitis;7;Patients are also told not to eat or drink anything until the symptoms get better.
Ischemic colitis;8;Severe ischemic colitis that leads to gangrene can be treated with antibiotics and surgery.
Ischemic colitis;9;Mesenteric ischemia
Hypotension;1;Hypotension is low blood pressure.
Hypotension;2;A person with low blood pressure is called hypotensive.
Hypotension;3;Everybody's blood pressure is different.
Hypotension;4;Some people have naturally low blood pressure.
Hypotension;5;However, for most adults, a systolic blood pressure of under 90, or a diastolic blood pressure of under 60, is low blood pressure.
Hypotension;6;"(Systolic is the top number in a blood pressure reading; diastolic is the bottom number.)"
Hypotension;7;Low blood pressure is not always dangerous.
Hypotension;8;However, low blood pressure is dangerous if it causes any of these symptoms:      If low blood pressure makes a person faint, the person could hurt themselves while falling.
Hypotension;9;If a person's blood pressure is very low, the heart will be unable to pump blood and oxygen to important parts of the body.
Hypotension;10;Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to live.
Hypotension;11;Without blood and oxygen, important parts of the body, like the heart and brain, can be damaged.
Hypotension;12;If a person's blood pressure is low enough that they are feeling dizzy, they should lay down on the ground.
Hypotension;13;Putting their feet up, or bending their knees, is also helpful.
Hypotension;14;This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing).
Hypotension;15;Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint.
Hypotension;16;Doctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure.
Hypotension;17;Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration.
Hypotension;18;This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) get fluids through a needle placed into a vein.
Hypotension;19;If low blood pressure is caused by medicines, doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much.
Hypotension;20;There are also medications that increase blood pressure.
Hypotension;21;They work by making it harder for blood vessels to relax.
Hypotension;22;(When blood vessels relax, blood pressure goes down.
Hypotension;23;If the blood vessels cannot relax as easily, blood pressure goes up.)
Hypotension;24;Blood pressure   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
Uremia;1;Uremia is a Greek word used in English to describe the condition of a person's blood.
Uremia;2;Uremia is caused by urine products building up in the blood.
Uremia;3;If those come over the normal filtration system of the kidneys then the condition is called uremia.
Uremia;4;People with chronic renal disease or acute renal failure are usually affected by uremia.
Uremia;5;Fatigue   Peripheral neuropathy   Anorexia   Decreased sense of smell and taste   Cramps   Restless legs   Sleep disturbances   Coma   Reduced muscle membrane potential   asterixis and tremor   lethargy/deterioration in mental status, encephalopathy, seizures   hyperreflexia and upgoing toes   uremic fetor   pericarditis and/or bruising (from qualitative, not quantitative, platelet dysfunction)   fall in BP and body temperature   nausea/vomiting   Amenorrhea and sexual dysfunction   Reduced body temperature   Altered amino acid levels   Bone disease due to phosphate retention, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin D deficiency   Insulin resistance   Increase protein-muscle catabolism   Anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency and shortened red-cell survival
Osteoporosis;1;Osteoporosis is the weakening of bones in the body.
Osteoporosis;2;It is caused by lack of calcium deposited in the bones.
Osteoporosis;3;This lack of calcium causes the bones to become brittle.
Osteoporosis;4;They break easily.
Osteoporosis;5;Side effects include limping.
Osteoporosis;6;Some symptoms late in the disease include pain in the bones, bones breaking very easily and lower back pain due to spinal bone fractures.
Osteoporosis;7;It is more likely for a woman to get osteoporosis than a man.
Osteoporosis;8;Elderly people are more likely to develop osteoporosis than younger people.
Osteoporosis;9;The amount of calcium in the bones decreases as a person gets older.
Osteoporosis;10;There are three kinds of osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis;11;There is no cure for osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis;12;A person can keep it from happening by exercising and taking the right amount of calcium each day.
Osteoporosis;13;75 million people in the United States, Japan, and Europe have osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis;14;30 million people in the US have poor bone density.
Osteoporosis;15;Vitamin D, calcium, and exercise are the three main things for healthy bones.
Osteoporosis;16;Consuming too much alcohol and caffeine can cause an increase in the risk of weak bones.
Osteoporosis;17;Too much salt increases the amount of calcium lost in urine.
Osteoporosis;18;This is bad because calcium makes bones strong.
Osteoporosis;19;People should not take iron and calcium supplements at the same time.
Osteoporosis;20;This is because calcium competes with the absorption of minerals such as iron.
Typhus;1;:Typhus is unrelated to both typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever   Typhus is the name for a number of diseases, caused by bacteria called Rickettsiae.
Typhus;2;These bacteria are parasites that cannot survive outside their host organism.
Typhus;3;Depending on the species the host organisms are, fleas (on rats), harvest mites (on several rodents and humans), or lice (on humans).
Typhus;4;When the term is commonly used, it usually means endemic typhus, which is spread by lice.
Typhus;5;The name typhus comes from Greek, where it means smoky or hazy.
Typhus;6;This was the word used to describe the state of mind the patients are in.
Typhus;7;Typhus can be treated with antibiotics.

Pneumothorax;1;"Pneumothorax (sometimes called "" collapsed lung "" ) is a health problem where air or gas is in the pleural space (the space between the lung and the pleura)."
Pneumothorax;2;The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs.
Pneumothorax;3;The two parts of the pleura usually touch.
Pneumothorax;4;A hole might grow in the surface of the lung.
Pneumothorax;5;Air then enters between the pleura and the lung.
Pneumothorax;6;The lung will collapse.
Pneumothorax;7;If enough air gets into the pleural space, it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest, like the heart or the aorta.
Pneumothorax;8;Pneumothorax is a medical emergency.
Pneumothorax;9;There are two main types of pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;10;These are a Closed Pneumothorax, and an Open Pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;11;These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;12;The most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains.
Pneumothorax;13;The chest pains can be sharp, dull, or stabbing.
Pneumothorax;14;Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and coughing.
Pneumothorax;15;A Pneumothorax can occur for no obvious reason (spontaneous).
Pneumothorax;16;It is typically men who are tall (or perhaps have long torsos), between the ages of 20 and 40 who present a spontaneous pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;17;Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the surface of the lungs.
Pneumothorax;18;These blebs sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the pleural space that surrounds the lungs, causing the lung to collapse.
Pneumothorax;19;Otherwise, it can be caused by blunt or penetrating injuries or lung diseases that result in the lung leaking air into the pleural cavity.
Pneumothorax;20;Consuming cannabis via smoking is also related to victims of a pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;21;Simple Pneumothorax will heal by itself.
Pneumothorax;22;Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention.
Pneumothorax;23;One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur.
Pneumothorax;24;Closed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound.
Pneumothorax;25;This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow, like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis.
Pneumothorax;26;Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs.
Pneumothorax;27;Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus.
Pneumothorax;28;The mucus blocks ducts and passageways.
Pneumothorax;29;The most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax;30;The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known.
Pneumothorax;31;Open pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest.
Pneumothorax;32;This can happen with stab wounds, like from a knife.
Pneumothorax;33;It can also happen after a gunshot injury.
Pneumothorax;34;The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person (or animal) breathes, but does not let it back out.
Pneumothorax;35;"Sometimes this is called a "" sucking chest wound. """
Trisomy;1;A trisomy is when there are three copies of a chromosome.
Trisomy;2;Normally in humans there is only two copies of any given chromosome.
Trisomy;3;The most notable condition is Trisomy 21 syndrome which is better known as Down Syndrome, a form of developmental genetic disorder.
Patau syndrome;1;Patau Sydrome, also known as Trisomy 13 or Trisomy D is a problem with the chromosomes.
Patau syndrome;2;People who suffer from it have an extra copy of chromosome 13.
Patau syndrome;3;This is usually because of a problem that occurred during meiosis, but it can also be the result of Robertsonian translocation, a common rearrangement of chromosomes in humans.
Patau syndrome;4;The risk of getting a problem during meiosis increases when women have babies later in life.
Patau syndrome;5;The average age for this syndrome is at 31 years.
Patau syndrome;6;It is the rarest of the three common trisomies.
Patau syndrome;7;Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome are more common.
Patau syndrome;8;Patau syndrome affects about one in 25,000 live births.
Dwarfism;1;Dwarfism is used to describe a person of short stature, less than 4 feet, 10 inches (147 cm).
Dwarfism;2;This is often, though not always, because of a medical condition.
Dwarfism;3;People with this condition are called dwarves or little people.
Dwarfism;4;"A similar term for short people is midget; however, dwarves and midgets are not the same."
Dwarfism;5;Midgets are perfectly proportioned humans, while dwarves have a large head and misshapen limbs and torsos.
Dwarfism;6;Dwarfism is often caused by the person inheriting an allele (a mutant gene), which produces a defect in development.
Dwarfism;7;Defects caused by genetics are the main kind of congenital defects, and usually cannot be cured.
Dwarfism;8;The most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in bone development called achondroplasia, in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body.
Dwarfism;9;This accounts for 70% of cases.
Dwarfism;10;Extreme shortness, but with body parts of normal proportions, may be caused by growth hormone deficiency, once known as pituitary dwarfism.
Dwarfism;11;There are more than 200 other conditions which may cause dwarfism.
Dwarfism;12;In the 19th century in the United States, people with dwarfism were a major attraction of many circus sideshows.
Dwarfism;13;The most famous little people in the history of the American circus are General Tom Thumb and Michu.
Tic;1;A tic is a sudden body movement that a person can't control.
Tic;2;It might be a jerking movement of the hand, or blinking a lot, or a throat sound.
Tic;3;Even if the person is told that they are doing it, they usually can't stop.
Tic;4;Sometimes if they try really hard, they can make the tic go away for a little bit, but they can't make it go away all the time.
Tic;5;It's kind of like when you have something in your throat, eventually you just have to cough.
Tic;6;"Tics can be either "" motor tics "" or "" phonic tics. """
Tic;7;"If they are "" motor tics "" it means they're movements, like blinking or shrugging shoulders."
Tic;8;"If they are "" phonic tics "" it means they're sounds, like clearing your throat, sniffing, or yelling."
Tic;9;Tics are common in childhood, four to twelve percent of all children have from tics.
Tic;10;Very often they are transitory, they rarely last longer than six months.
Tic;11;Boys have tics more often than girls.
Tic;12;About three times more boys than girls have tics.
Tic;13;"Sometimes, people can have a "" tic "" in the family."
Tic;14;Some tics can be treated, usually with behaviour therapy.
Tic;15;In cases where the tic is difficult to treat, antipsychotics are sometimes used.
Edwards syndrome;1;Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome is a trisomy.
Edwards syndrome;2;It is a genetic disorder.
Edwards syndrome;3;"People with trisomy 18 have three copies of chromosome 18. """
Edwards syndrome;4;"Normal "" people have two copies of the chromosome."
Edwards syndrome;5;It is named after John H. Edwards, who first described the syndrome in 1960.
Edwards syndrome;6;It is the second most common autosomal trisomy, after Down Syndrome, that carries to term.
Edwards syndrome;7;It is estimated that about one in 3,000 live births are affected.
Edwards syndrome;8;The incidence increases as the mother's age increases.
Edwards syndrome;9;The syndrome has a very low rate of survival.
Edwards syndrome;10;People with Edwards syndrome often have heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders.
Edwards syndrome;11;About 95% of the babies with Edwards syndrome die before they are born.
Edwards syndrome;12;About half of all babies born with the condition will reach two months of age, and only 5-10% will survive for a year.
Edwards syndrome;13;The median life span is five to fifteen days.
Edwards syndrome;14;One percent of children born with this syndrome live to age ten, typically in cases of the less severe mosaic Edwards syndrome.
Trench foot;1;Trench foot or fat foot is a medical condition that is caused by keeping feet in the cold, in dirty places, or in water for a long time.
Trench foot;2;Trench foot was a big problem in the trenches of World War I.
Trench foot;3;Many of the soldiers fighting got this condition.
Trench foot;4;The soldiers found it difficult to cope with the swelling wearing their boots but after realised that they could not get the boot on again as the foot had swollen to twice its size.
Trench foot;5;Many men who suffered from it ending up having their feet amputated because they could not deal with the pain.
Trench foot;6;This can be treated by rubbing it to cause friction and if it is kept warm it can heal itself.
Neglect;1;Neglect is a kind of abuse where a person harms another person by not giving them the things they need to live.
Neglect;2;"For example, a parent or caregiver may neglect a child by not giving them enough food, clothing, hygiene, medical care, affection or education; this is a form of child abuse."
Neglect;3;Victims of neglect are those that need looking after, like children, physically or mentally disabled adults, elderly people, medical patients, animals or plants.
Thought disorder;1;In psychiatry the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g.
Thought disorder;2;with spoken and written language.
Thought disorder;3;The people who have this condition use language that is disordered, or sometimes hard to follow.
Thought disorder;4;According to the psychiatrists, language is a reflection of thought processes.
Thought disorder;5;People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking.
Thought disorder;6;Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness, but there can also be other causes for it.
Thought disorder;7;The condition it describes is permanent.
Thought disorder;8;It affects speech and writing.
Thought disorder;9;Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence.
Thought disorder;10;"They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as 'word salad'."
Thought disorder;11;Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process.
Thought disorder;12;However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language.
Thought disorder;13;This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate, more commonly used but abbreviated term, 'thought disorder', is used.
Avoidant personality disorder;1;Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is a type of personality disorder, a long-term mental illness.
Avoidant personality disorder;2;They feel that they are not good people and are afraid of people rejecting them.
Avoidant personality disorder;3;Avoids jobs or activities that involve a lot of contact with other people because of being very afraid of rejection or being criticised by other people   Does not want to get involved with people unless they are sure that the other person likes them   Is restrained or reserved in relationships and does not let people get too close because of being afraid of being made to feel bad   Spends a lot of time thinking about being criticised or rejected in social situations   Feels inhibited when meeting new people because of feeling not as good as other people   Thinks that they are not good with people, not attractive, or not as good as other people   Does not like to take risks or do new things in case they get embarrassed or feel bad   The symptoms of AvPD are much more serious than ordinary shyness.
Vascular dementia;1;Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease.
Vascular dementia;2;It is a type of dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain.
Vascular dementia;3;Brain cells need a good supply of blood to stay healthy and function properly.
Vascular dementia;4;The blood is delivered through a network of blood vessels called the vascular system.
Vascular dementia;5;If the vascular system within the brain becomes damaged and blood cannot reach the brain cells, the cells will eventually die.
Vascular dementia;6;This can lead to the onset of vascular dementia.
Hypothermia;1;Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal.
Hypothermia;2;Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than .
Hypothermia;3;Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop.
Hypothermia;4;The person then becomes confused and acts strange.
Hypothermia;5;Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy.
Hypothermia;6;Sometimes they become very tired.
Hypothermia;7;If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital.
Hypothermia;8;If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink.
Hypothermia;9;When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop.
Hypothermia;10;The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands.
Hypothermia;11;They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well.
Hypothermia;12;Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems.
Hypothermia;13;It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs.
Hypothermia;14;This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest.
Hypothermia;15;The person begins shivering very strongly.
Hypothermia;16;Their large muscles do not work well.
Hypothermia;17;They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking .
Hypothermia;18;The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue.
Hypothermia;19;This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm.
Hypothermia;20;The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere.
Hypothermia;21;Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering.
Hypothermia;22;"They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands."
Hypothermia;23;Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse.
Hypothermia;24;They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep.
Hypothermia;25;If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions.
Hypothermia;26;Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster.
Hypothermia;27;Finally, the person dies.

Stomach cancer;1;Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a kind of cancer from any part of the stomach.
Stomach cancer;2;Stomach cancer causes about 800,000 deaths worldwide per year.
Stomach cancer;3;Odds of survival is 5 to 15%.
Stomach cancer;4;The life span of someone with stomach cancer is five to fifteen years.
Stomach cancer;5;This is because this type of cancer can spread faster than other cancers.
Stomach cancer;6;Most stomach cancer is caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.
Stomach cancer;7;Diet foods are not proven causes, but some foods, such as smoked foods, salted fish and meat, and pickled vegetables are associated with a higher risk.
Binge drinking;1;Binge drinking is an unhealthy way of drinking alcoholic beverages.
Binge drinking;2;When people binge drink, they usually drink a lot of alcohol in a short time, or drink with the goal of getting drunk.
Binge drinking;3;Binge drinking is very common in the United States.
Binge drinking;4;"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that in the U.S.:   More than half of the alcohol drunk by adults is drunk during binge drinking; and   About 90% of the alcohol drunk by youth under age 21 is drunk during binge drinking."
Binge drinking;5;Different researchers and countries sometimes have different definitions of what exactly binge drinking is.
Binge drinking;6;In the United States, the most common definition of binge drinking was created by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2009.
Binge drinking;7;It says that binge drinking is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) to 0.08 or more.
Binge drinking;8;Blood alcohol content is the percentage of ethanol in the person's blood.
Binge drinking;9;(In the United States, a BAC of 0.08 means a person is legally drunk.)
Binge drinking;10;This means that a person would be binge drinking if:   A usual adult man had five or more drinks in about two hours   A usual adult woman had four or more drinks in about two hours.
Binge drinking;11;"In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service says that binge drinking is having "" eight or more units [of alcohol] in a single [drinking] session for men and six or more for women. """
Binge drinking;12;(Units are used in the United Kingdom to measure alcohol.)
Binge drinking;13;"This means a person would be binge drinking if:   A usual adult man drank four glasses of wine, or three and a half pints of beer, in a single drinking session   A usual adult woman drank three glasses of wine, or three pints of beer, in a single drinking session   A recent report paid for by the European Union suggested that binge drinking should be defined, across Europe, as drinking "" 60g alcohol (men) and 40g alcohol (women) in a period of about two hours. """
Binge drinking;14;Binge drinking can be dangerous.
Binge drinking;15;It can cause alcohol poisoning.
Binge drinking;16;If a person drinks too much, they can stop breathing and die.
Binge drinking;17;Binge drinking can also damage the liver.
Binge drinking;18;Also, it increases binge drinkers' risks of having other problems.
Binge drinking;19;Binge drinkers are more likely than people who do not binge drink to:   Hurt themselves accidentally (for example, by falling or drowning)   Drive while drunk, crash the car, and hurt or kill themselves or other people   Hurt themselves or other people on purpose (injuries from guns, rape, and domestic violence are all more common among binge drinkers)   Get sexually transmitted diseases or get pregnant without meaning to (because they are more likely to take risks and not use birth control like condoms)   Have children who are born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome   Have high blood pressure, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases   Get liver disease, like cirrhosis   Get brain damage   Have erectile dysfunction
Viral hemorrhagic fever;1;Viral hemorrhagic fever is the name for a number of diseases.
Viral hemorrhagic fever;2;They often include fever and bleeding.
Viral hemorrhagic fever;3;They are caused by viruses.
Viral hemorrhagic fever;4;These fevers are one of the possible causes of the Black Death (most people think it is the bubonic plague).

Hyperkalemia;1;Hyperkalemia is a medical term to indicate that the level of potassium in the blood is too high.
Hyperkalemia;2;Depending on the level of potassium in the blood, this can be a medical emergency.
Hyperkalemia;3;A level that is too high can lead to abnormal hearth rhythms.
Hyperkalemia;4;Many medications can cause hyperkalemia, and it is much more likely to occur in people kidney problems.
Hyperkalemia;5;Although hyperkalemia often doesn't cause symptoms, doctors worry about hyperkalemia because it can cause a sudden change of heart rhythm in people who had not been having any symptoms.
Hyperkalemia;6;These abnormal heart rhythms can be deadly.
Hyperkalemia;7;In the cases where death penalty is carried out using lethal injection, a hyperkalemia may be provoked atificially.
Hyperkalemia;8;Some of the mixtures used in the injections contain potassium chloride which will raise the level of potassium in the blood considerably.
Measles;1;Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus.
Measles;2;People catch measles from other people.
Measles;3;It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe.
Measles;4;People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose.
Measles;5;They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body.
Measles;6;These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching.
Measles;7;Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch.
Measles;8;If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it.
Measles;9;In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles.
Measles;10;Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella.
Measles;11;The three vaccinations are all in one injection.
Measles;12;Measles is sometimes also called rubeola, but it is not the same as rubella (German measles).
Measles;13;The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists.
Measles;14;There is no cure for measles.
Measles;15;People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away.
Measles;16;Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it.

Renal cell carcinoma;1;Renal cell carcinoma is a type of renal cancer (cancer of the kidneys).
Renal cell carcinoma;2;Often, if it is found early, it can be cured.
Renal cell carcinoma;3;However, if the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body metastasized by the time it is diagnosed, it is much more difficult to treat successfully.
Renal cell carcinoma;4;Pain in the flanks (the sides of the abdomen)   Weight loss   Fever   Blood in the urine   A mass that can be felt through the skin   In bad cases, patients may also have symptoms of metastasis (symptoms in other parts of the body where the cancer has spread)   When renal cell carcinoma is diagnosed early on, the best treatment is to remove the sick kidney.

Hypertrophy;1;In biology, hypertrophy is the increase in size of an organ, beyond normal growth.
Hypertrophy;2;Hypertrophy happens because the cells grow bigger.
Hypertrophy;3;The condition where an organ is bigger, because there are more cells is called hyperplasia.
Hypertrophy;4;Some cells like adipocytes (fat cells) get larger by expanding outward while filling up with more lipid contents, while myocytes (muscle cells) can fuse with other myocytes to form huge myotube cells.
Hypertrophy;5;Organs or tissues can grow larger due to the enlargement of their component cells.
Hypertrophy;6;One of the most common and visible forms of normal, organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding.
Hypertrophy;7;In contrast, tissues and organs can also get larger by another mechanism, hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number.
Hypertrophy;8;Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together.
Hypertrophy;9;The hormonally-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy is an example of this combination under normal conditions.
Hypertrophy;10;In some tumors, enlargement can occur by an increase in the number of cells together with the occurrence of some abnormally large cells.

Bladder cancer;2;It is much more common in men than in women.
Ketosis;1;Ketosis occurs when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver.
Ketosis;2;Ketone bodies are created by the breakdown of fatty acid.
Ketosis;3;Ketosis can be understood as the use of body fat as a source of energy.
Ketosis;4;The body goes through ketosis when there is not enough carbohydrate to refill glycogen in the liver.
Ketosis;5;An example of this kind of diet is the Atkins diet, where followers start by eating fewer than 20g of carbohydrates per day.
Ketosis;6;It takes 48 hours for the brain to switch from glucose to ketone bodies.
Ketosis;7;Ketosis helps the body prevent using protein, from muscles, for gluconeogenesis to make glucose.
Ketosis;8;Ketosis   In essence, a ketogenic diet mimics starvation, allowing the body to go into a metabolic state called ketosis (key-tow-sis).
Ketosis;9;Normally, human bodies are sugar-driven machines: ingested carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is mainly transported and used as energy or stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue.
Ketosis;10;When deprived of dietary carbohydrates (usually below 50g/day), the liver becomes the sole provider of glucose to feed your hungry organs – especially the brain, a particularly greedy entity accounting for ~20% of total energy expenditure.
Ketosis;11;The brain cannot DIRECTLY use fat for energy.
Ketosis;12;Once liver glycogen is depleted, without a backup energy source, humanity would’ve long disappeared in the eons of evolution.
Ketosis;13;The backup is ketone bodies that the liver derives primarily from fatty acids in your diet or body fat.
Ketosis;14;These ketones – ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate and acetone – are released into the bloodstream, taken up by the brain and other organs, shuttled into the “energy factory” mitochondria and used up as fuel.
Ketosis;15;Excess BHB and acetoacetate are excreted from urine, while acetone, due to its volatile nature, is breathed out (hence the characteristically sweet “keto breath”).
Ketosis;16;Meanwhile, blood glucose remains physiologically normal due to glucose derived from certain amino acids and the breakdown of fatty acids – voila, low blood sugar avoided!
Ketosis;17;"Carbohydrate restriction induces the pancreas to "" tell "" fat cells to release fatty acids, which get taken up by the liver and converted into ketones and released into blood."
Ketosis;18;Once taken up by the brain, ketones enter the TCA cycle to generate energy.
Ketosis;19;Source: Shelly Fan.
Ketosis;20;(click to see large)   Brain on ketones: Energetics, Oxidation and Inflammation   So the brain is happily deriving energy from ketones – sure, but why would this be protective against such a variety of brain diseases?
Ketosis;21;One answer may be energy.
Ketosis;22;Despite their superficial differences, many neurological diseases share one major problem – deficient energy production.
Ketosis;23;During metabolic stress, ketones serve as an alternative energy source to maintain normal brain cell metabolism.
Ketosis;24;In fact, BHB (a major ketone) may be an even more efficient fuel than glucose, providing more energy per unit oxygen used.
Ketosis;25;A ketogenic diet also increases the number of mitochondria, so called “energy factories” in brain cells.
Ketosis;26;A recent study found enhanced expression of genes encoding for mitochondrial enzymes and energy metabolism in the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for learning and memory.
Ketosis;27;Hippocampal cells often degenerate in age-related brain diseases, leading to cognitive dysfunction and memory loss.
Ketosis;28;With increased energy reserve, neurons may be able to ward off disease stressors that would usually exhaust and kill the cell.
Ketosis;29;A ketogenic diet may also DIRECTLY inhibit a major source of neuronal stress, by -well- acting like a blueberry.
Ketosis;30;Reactive oxygen species are unfortunate byproducts of cellular metabolism.
Ketosis;31;Unlike the gas Oxygen, these “oxidants” have a single electron that makes them highly reactive, bombarding into proteins and membranes and wrecking their structure.
Ketosis;32;Increased oxidants are a hallmark of aging, stroke and neurodegeneration.
Ketosis;33;Ketones directly inhibit the production of these violent molecules, and enhance their breakdown through increasing the activity of glutathione peroxidase, a part of our innate anti-oxidant system.
Ketosis;34;The low intake of carbohydrates also directly reduces glucose oxidation (something called “glycolysis”).
Ketosis;35;Using a glucose-like non-metabolized analogue, one studyfound that neurons activate stress proteins to lower oxidant levels and stabilize mitochondria.
Ketosis;36;Due to its high fat nature, keto increases poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, such as DHA and EPA, both sold over-the-counter as “brain healthy” supplements), which in turn reduces oxidant production and inflammation.
Ketosis;37;Inflammatory stress is another “root of all evil”, which PUFAs target by inhibiting the expression of genes encoding for pro-inflammatory factors.
Ketosis;38;Neurons on Ketones:   Excited neurons transmit signals, process information and form the basis of a functioning brain.
Ketosis;39;OVER-excited neurons tend to die.
Ketosis;40;The brain teeters on a balance between excitation and inhibition through two main neurotransmitters, the excitatory glutamate and the inhibitory GABA.
Ketosis;41;Tilt the scale towards glutamate, which occurs in stroke, seizures and neurodegeneration, and you get excitotoxicity.
Ketosis;42;In other words, hyper-activity is toxic.
Ketosis;43;Back in the 1930s, researchers found that direct injection of various ketone bodies into rabbits prevented chemically-induced seizures through inhibiting glutamate release, but the precise mechanism was unclear.
Ketosis;44;A recent study in hippocampal neurons showed that ketones directly inhibited the neuron’s ability to “load up” on glutamate – that is, the transmitter can’t be packaged into vesicles and released – and thus decreased excitatory transmission.
Ketosis;45;In a model of epilepsy that used a chemical similar to glutamate to induce damage, the diet protected miceagainst cell death in the hippocampus by inhibiting pro-death signaling molecules.
Ketosis;46;On the other end of the excitation-inhibition balance, ketones increase GABA in the synapses (where neurotransmitters are released) of rats and in the brains of some (but not all) epileptic humans subjects.
Ketosis;47;This increase in inhibition may confer both anti-seizure effects and neuroprotection, though data is still scant.
Ketosis;48;Then there are some fringe hypotheses.
Ketosis;49;The acidity of ketones may decrease the pH of certain brain microdomains, which might be the mechanism of keto’s positive effect on Type II Bipolar disorder (lots of mays and mights, I know).
Ketosis;50;As keto affects the whole body, global changes due to calorie restriction and regulation of the satiety hormone Leptin are bound to alter brain function, and play a circumstantial role.
Ketosis;51;evidence ketosis are neuroprotector .
Ketosis;52;All these molecular changes suggest that a ketogenic diet is protective against brain injury.
Ketosis;53;But is there any REAL evidence?
Ketosis;54;A study with 23 elderly with mild cognitive impairment showed that a ketogenic diet improved verbal memory performance after 6 weeks compared to a standard high carbohydrate diet.
Ketosis;55;In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 152 patients with mild- to moderate Alzheimer’s disease were given either a ketogenic agent or a placebo, while maintaining a normal diet.
Ketosis;56;90 days later, those receiving the drug showed marked cognitive improvement compared to placebo, which was correlated with the level of ketones in the blood.
Ketosis;57;In a pilot study in 7 patients with Parkinson’s disease, 5 were able to stick to the diet for 28 days and showed marked reduction in their physical symptoms.
Ketosis;58;"In an animal model of Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a ketogenic diet also led to delayed motor neuron death and histological and functional improvements, although it did not increase life span; clinical trials are on the way."
Ketosis;59;Remarkably, a long-term ketogenic diet does not seem to be associated with significant side effects, although constipation, dehydration and electrolyte and micronutrient deficiencies are common complaints.
Ketosis;60;More serious complications include increased chance of kidney stones, gallbladder problems and bone fractures, especially in children.
Ketosis;61;Menstrual irregularities often occur in women, with potential impact on fertlity.
Ketosis;62;Although ketoacidosis – acidification of the blood due to pathological levels of ketones – was historically proposed as a side effect, nutritional ketosis simply cannot achieve the level of ketones required to induce this life-threatening state.
Ketosis;63;Nevertheless, there are no studies directly monitoring the side effects of ketosis yet, hence it’s too early to conclude that the diet is completely safe for everyone.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;1;Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that is most common in children.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;2;Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer that begins in muscle tissue - usually the muscles that are attached to bones to help a person move.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;3;"Rhabdomyosarcoma should not be confused with rhabdomyolysis, which is often called "" rhabdo "" for short."
Rhabdomyosarcoma;4;There are three different kinds of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;5;This is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;6;More than half of people with this cancer have ERMS.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;7;It is most common in children under age 6.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;8;"Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma usually happens in:   The head or neck;   The genitals; or   The urinary system."
Rhabdomyosarcoma;9;This is the second most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;10;Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in older children and teenagers, but it can also happen in younger children and adults.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;11;"ARMS usually happens in the big muscles in:   The arms or legs;   The chest; or   The abdomen   However, it can also happen in the genitals or the area around the anus."
Rhabdomyosarcoma;12;This type of rhabdomyosarcoma usually grows faster than embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and needs more treatment than ERMS.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;13;Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma does not happen very often.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;14;"When it does happen, it usually affects adults; is very rare in children."
Rhabdomyosarcoma;15;This type of cancer usually grows quickly and needs a lot of treatment.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;16;The choice of how to treat rhabdomyosarcoma depends on many things.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;17;For example:   Where is the tumor?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;18;How big is the tumor?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;19;Has the tumor spread to other parts of the body?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;20;Can the entire tumor be taken out by surgery?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;21;What type of rhabdomyosarcoma does the person have?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;22;Has the cancer caused changes to the person's genes?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;23;How old is the patient?
Rhabdomyosarcoma;24;Based on all of these things, the patient and their medical team can decide what treatment is best.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;25;There are three types of treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma:   Radiation   Chemotherapy   Surgery   The prognosis of a person with rhabdomyosarcoma also depends on many different things.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;26;For example, adults with rhabdomyosarcoma usually have tumors that grow faster and are harder to treat.
Rhabdomyosarcoma;27;Prognosis also depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma a person has, what kind of treatment they get, whether their cancer has spread, and many other things.
Underweight;1;The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should.
Underweight;2;Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected.
Underweight;3;It is normal what a person's weights changes over time.
Underweight;4;Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score, based on height and weight.
Underweight;5;If this score is below 18.5, a person is generally said to be underweight.
Underweight;6;This is only a general indication, though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone.
Underweight;7;It does not apply to children and adolescents, for example.
Underweight;8;Being underweight can have different causes:   Malnutrition, not eating enough, or eating the wrong kinds of foods.
Underweight;9;The right kinds may not be available, or they may be too expensive to buy.
Underweight;10;The weight of a person is also determined by genetic factors.
Underweight;11;"One of these factors is that some people have a "" lighter build "" than others."
Underweight;12;Stress, anxiety and depression can influence weight   There are eating disorders that cause people to become underweight.
Underweight;13;The most common of these are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa   Sudden unexplained weight loss can point to a disease, such as cancer, tuberculosis, hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease   Sometimes the use of drugs leads to weight loss   Organs of the digestive tract may not be working as expected   People who train sports too much may be using more energy than they get.
Underweight;14;There are problems that are related to being underweight.
Underweight;15;Very often being underweight is not the first problem.
Underweight;16;Rather, it often is the effect of another condition or disease.
Underweight;17;Unexpected weight loss requires the attention of a doctor.
Underweight;18;There might be another disease.
Underweight;19;If that disease is treated, the weight problem also disappears.
Underweight;20;Another problem underweight people face is that the weight problem affects their health: Their immune system is weakened, and they may get sick more often.
Underweight;21;People who are underweight because they cannot get or afford the right food need special attention.
Underweight;22;Women who are underweight may not have their menstruation and face difficult pregnancies.
Underweight;23;Once they were being underweight, psychically, they may feel sad and worried about their health.
Underweight;24;Therefore, family and friends should support them to help them get rid of their unhappiness.

Type 1 diabetes;1;Diabetes mellitus type 1, also called type 1 diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that results in high blood sugar.
Type 1 diabetes;2;The disease is thought to be strongly linked to genetic factors, but the trigger that starts the autoimmune disease is not currently known.
Type 1 diabetes;3;In the past, type 1 diabetes was generally thought to be a disorder in children and teenagers.
Type 1 diabetes;4;However, it's now been found that adults can be diagnosed with the disease.
Type 1 diabetes;5;Although type 1 diabetes can now be diagnosed at any age, it is one of the most common chronic conditions in children and young adults.
Type 1 diabetes;6;Being diagnosed at ages 5–7 or at the start of puberty is particularly common.
Type 1 diabetes;7;Type 1 diabetes is also slightly more common in boys.
Type 1 diabetes;8;Cases of type 1 diabetes have been increasing across the world for several decades.
Type 1 diabetes;9;Approximately 1 in 300 people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by the age of 18 in the United States.
Type 1 diabetes;10;If this rate continues, the number of cases of type 1 diabetes could double in the next decade.
Type 1 diabetes;11;In type 1 diabetes, symptoms generally develop over a few days or weeks, though may take longer in adults.
Type 1 diabetes;12;The main symptoms are:   - Feeling very thirsty   - Urinating more often then normal, especially at night   - Exhaustion   - Loss of weight   - Itchiness around the genital area   - Blurring of sight   - Slow healing of wounds and grazes   Nausea, vomiting and heavy breathing are more serious symptoms.
Type 1 diabetes;13;They occur at a later stage in the disease, and if they're seen a sufferer should be taken to hospital immediately.
Type 1 diabetes;14;Sufferers of type 1 diabetes may have to deal with both short-term and long-term complications, particularly if the disease is not well managed.
Type 1 diabetes;15;Hypoglycaemia is when blood sugar levels decrease to below normal.
Type 1 diabetes;16;This is most commonly due to overuse of medications for diabetes type 1 like insulin or from poor diet control.
Type 1 diabetes;17;The risk of suffering from low blood sugar is increased by drinking alcohol.
Type 1 diabetes;18;Leads to various symptoms, including confusion, loss of consciousness, clumsiness, seizures or death.
Type 1 diabetes;19;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a very serious complication of type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes;20;It is always a medical emergency and requires rapid medical attention to prevent further damage to a patient, if left untreated it can potentially lead to death.
Type 1 diabetes;21;DKA occurs when there is not enough insulin in the body to supply sugars to the body's cells.
Type 1 diabetes;22;In order to give its cells enough energy to survive, the body begins to produce acidic ketone bodies which are then used to feed energy to the cells.
Type 1 diabetes;23;If too many ketone bodies build up the blood becomes acidic, damaging the body and leading to the symptoms:   - Vomiting   - Dehydration   - Difficult breathing   - Fast heartbeat   - Confusion   - Coma   If diabetes is not treated, even mildly raised blood sugar levels can damage nerves, organs and blood vessels in the body .
Type 1 diabetes;24;Diabetic retinopathy, damage to the blood vessels prevent enough blood from reaching the eye.
Type 1 diabetes;25;This can lead the eye's retina being damaged, resulting in loss of vision or blindness.
Type 1 diabetes;26;Diabetic neuropathy, damage to blood vessels near nerves can result in reduced blood flow.
Type 1 diabetes;27;This can damage the nerves, leading to a loss in the sense of touch, normally starting from the hands or feet, before spreading up the body.
Type 1 diabetes;28;Diabetic nephropathy, blood vessels in the kidney become damaged, making the kidney work less effectively.
Type 1 diabetes;29;In sever cases.
Type 1 diabetes;30;this can result in kidney failure.
Type 1 diabetes;31;Sexual dysfunction   Increased risk of heart disease and stroke   Narrowing of blood vessels (peripheral arterial disease).
Type 1 diabetes;32;Diabetic foot, narrowing of blood vessels reduces sensitivity and slows wound healing in the foot.
Type 1 diabetes;33;If not managed appropriately, can lead to ulceration and gangrene in the foot.
Type 1 diabetes;34;In very severe cases, amputation may be required.
Type 1 diabetes;35;Currently, there is no known cure for diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes;36;Instead, treatment is designed to help keep blood sugar levels normal in order to reduce the chances of complications developing as the disease progresses.
Type 1 diabetes;37;There are two main method that are combined to manage diabetes type 1:   Healthy eating: eating a diet focused on fruit and vegetables, whilst limiting fats, salt and sugar helps keep blood sugar levels in check.
Type 1 diabetes;38;Exercise: regular physical activity helps to lower your blood sugar level.
Type 1 diabetes;39;A good goal to aim for is 150 minutes of exercise a week.
Type 1 diabetes;40;Stopping smoking: smoking further increases the risk of heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke.
Type 1 diabetes;41;Stopping or reducing smoking will reduce the risk of these complications.
Type 1 diabetes;42;Reducing alcohol: alcohol can either raise or lower blood sugar, and makes it difficult to monitor your own blood sugar levels.
Type 1 diabetes;43;Drinking alcohol in moderation can reduce these risks.
Type 1 diabetes;44;Type 1 diabetes occurs due to the bodies inability to produce its own insulin.
Type 1 diabetes;45;To counter this, insulin can be injected into the blood manually.
Type 1 diabetes;46;When diabetes is first diagnosed, a plan should be made for insulin treatment in order to not under or overdose, which can lead to serious complications.
Type 1 diabetes;47;A sufferer should monitor their own blood sugar levels continuously to know whether they need a dose of insulin to lower their blood sugar.
Type 1 diabetes;48;There are different kinds of insulin that can be taken:   Rapid-acting insulin and short-acting insulin get insulin into the bloodstream very quickly.
Type 1 diabetes;49;They are typically taken before a meal to prepare for the rise in blood sugar that follows eating food.
Type 1 diabetes;50;Long acting insulin provides insulin in the system for up to 24 hours.
Type 1 diabetes;51;It is generally taken once a day
Keloid;1;A keloid is a type of scar that can form where somebody has an injury.
Keloid;2;Keloids are tough and get larger over time, not going away.
Keloid;3;They can become as big as 30 centimeters long.
Keloid;4;They are shaped irregularly, rising high above the skin.
Klinefelter syndrome;1;Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY, or XXY syndrome is a genetic disorder where people have an extra number of X chromosomes.
Klinefelter syndrome;2;"People who have Klinefelter's Syndrome are often called "" XXY Males "" , or "" 47, XXY Males "" ."
Klinefelter syndrome;3;Males who have this condition are almost always infertile.
Klinefelter syndrome;4;This means that they cannot father babies.
Klinefelter syndrome;5;Other males can have Klinefelter's Syndrome as well as humans.
Klinefelter syndrome;6;The mouse is one example.
Klinefelter syndrome;7;Tortoiseshell or calico markings on male cats are an indicator of a similar syndrome.
Klinefelter syndrome;8;These cats are considered to be the model organism for Klinefelter syndrome, because the gene for a cat's tabby coat markings is found on the X chromosome.
Heartburn;1;Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling in the chest that happens when acids from the stomach travel up the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach).
Heartburn;2;When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a symptom.
Heartburn;3;"The burning sensation is commonly called "" heartburn, "" but it has nothing to do with the heart."
Heartburn;4;The symptom may be helped by taking antacids, such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.
Heartburn;5;Gastroesophageal reflux disease   MedicineNet, GERD   National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC), GERD   MedlinePlus, GERD
Chemical burn;1;A chemical burn is an uncomfortable sensation caused by the destruction of body tissue.
Chemical burn;2;It is destroyed by various chemicals.
Chemical burn;3;For example, concentrated sulfuric acid makes very bad chemical burns.
Chemical burn;4;Hydrochloric acid makes milder burns.
Chemical burn;5;There are several ways to protect against chemical burns, such as wearing gloves and a lab apron when working with chemicals.
Chemical burn;6;Each chemical has its own way to remove it from the skin, but normally drenching the burn with water should help.
Chemical burn;7;Chemistry   Burn
Persistent vegetative state;1;A persistent vegetative state is what happens when a person in a coma becomes somewhat aware of what is happening around them.
Persistent vegetative state;2;However, they have little or no control over their body.
Persistent vegetative state;3;Most people who are in a PVS cannot live without medicine or machinery, such as a ventilator.
Muscle atrophy;1;Muscle atrophy or “muscle wastage” is a medical problem where a person loses muscle tissue.
Muscle atrophy;2;This makes the person's muscles weaker.
Muscle atrophy;3;With muscle atrophy, muscles can waste away completely, or only partly.
Muscle atrophy;4;Many older people have muscular atrophy.
Muscle atrophy;5;Muscle atrophy can also happen to people with certain diseases or medical conditions, like cancer, AIDS, congestive heart failure, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure (where the kidneys do not work correctly).
Muscle atrophy;6;Muscles can atrophy (or get smaller and weaker) when those muscles are not used as much as usual - for example, when a person has to wear a cast for a broken arm or leg, or when a person must be on bed rest for a long time during a long illness.
Muscle atrophy;7;Muscle atrophy can also be caused by Dejerine Sottas syndrome, cachexia, burns, liver failure, and starvation.
Muscle atrophy;8;Muscular atrophy can cause serious problems in a person's life.
Muscle atrophy;9;As the person loses muscle strength, he will lose the ability to do more and more things.
Muscle atrophy;10;When he tries to do things, he will be more likely to have accidents.
Muscle atrophy;11;Muscular atrophy also increases the risks of falling among people with certain medical conditions, such as IBM (inclusion body myositis).
Muscle atrophy;12;No one knows exactly what causes muscular atrophy.
Muscle atrophy;13;"It may be due to the gradual failure in the "" satellite cells "" which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibres, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival."
Muscle atrophy;14;In muscle atrophy, the normal balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation changes.
Muscle atrophy;15;There is a down-regulation of protein synthesis pathways, and an activation of protein breakdown pathways.
Muscle atrophy;16;In the ATP-dependent ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, particular proteins are targeted for destruction by the ligation of at least four copies of a small peptide called ubiquitin onto a substrate protein.
Muscle atrophy;17;The substrate is later targeted for destruction by the proteasome.
Muscle atrophy;18;Muscle atrophy can be treated   by exercise which induces an increase in muscle mass.
Muscle atrophy;19;The exercise downregulates the pathways which induce muscle hypertrophy, or an increase in muscle size.
Muscle atrophy;20;by the use of functional electrical stimulation to stimulate the muscles.
Muscle atrophy;21;This has seen a large amount of success in the rehabilitation of paraplegic patients.
Muscle atrophy;22;by therapy with muscle-building amino acids for regenerating damaged or atrophied muscle tissue.
Muscle atrophy;23;The branched-chain amino acids or BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are critical to this process, in addition to lysine and other amino acids.
Arteriosclerosis;1;Arteriosclerosis is a diseased condition of the arteries.
Arteriosclerosis;2;The artery walls are thickened, hardened and lose stretchiness, called elasticity.
Arteriosclerosis;3;There are three main types:   Atherosclerosis is the most common type.
Arteriosclerosis;4;It is the narrowing of arteries from a buildup of plaque, usually made up of cholesterol, fatty substances, cellular waste products, calcium and fibrin, inside the arteries.
Arteriosclerosis;5;"This affects large and medium-sized arteries; however, its positioning varies person to person."
Arteriosclerosis;6;Mönckeberg Arteriosclerosis.
Arteriosclerosis;7;This is when the middle layer of the artery stiffens.
Arteriosclerosis;8;This is because of calcium deposits.
Arteriosclerosis;10;This affects the body's smaller arteries.
Arteriosclerosis;11;The effects of arteriosclerosis can lead to lack of regular blood flow.
Arteriosclerosis;12;Low blood flow to the brain can make you dizzy, numb, have slurred speech, and have other symptoms.
Arteriosclerosis;13;Thromboses can further block the blood flow.
Arteriosclerosis;14;This causes you to be at risk of getting stroke, or a heart attack.
Arteriosclerosis;15;Arteriosclerosis is a major health problem.
Arteriosclerosis;16;Arteriosclerosis can be prevented by reducing risks.
Arteriosclerosis;17;Risks are smoking, obesity, and low amounts of exercise.
Arteriosclerosis;18;Doctors recommend dieting and exercise.
Arteriosclerosis;19;Diets consist of low amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats.
Arteriosclerosis;20;Some patients may take drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol in their blood.
Tennis elbow;1;Tennis elbow or archer's elbow is a condition where the outer part of the elbow becomes sore and tender.
Tennis elbow;2;It is often associated with playing tennis, golf or other kinds of sport that use a racquet.
Tennis elbow;3;"The following can cause the condition:   Only using part of the elbow; this can happen with mouse/keyboard users (called Repetitive strain injury), or with certain forms of mountain climbing."
Tennis elbow;4;Keeping the body in a bad tenure/positioning   Wrong technique in sports that use clubs or racquets (such as tennis or golf)   There are few specific means of treatment, but certain general forms may help:   Physical therapy   Using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen or aspirin   Using heat or cold   Using a brace or strap to reduce the strain on the elbow
Gangrene;1;Gangrene is a serious medical condition that causes the decay and death of body tissue, usually in the extremities such as the fingers, hands, toes, and feet.
Gangrene;2;The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene.
Gangrene;3;A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as gas gangrene.
Gangrene;4;A very rare type which affects the internal organs is known as internal gangrene.
Gangrene;5;Dry gangrene is usually caused by a loss of blood supply to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the blood vessels to the affected area.
Gangrene;6;Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes infected with various types of bacteria.
Gangrene;7;Gas gangrene is usually caused by clostridium bacteria and mainly affects the muscles.
Gangrene;8;Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the intestines, gallbladder, or appendix.
Gangrene;9;There are a number of risk factors which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene.
Gangrene;10;These includes advanced blockage of the arteries in medical conditions such as diabetes.
Glycogen storage disease type II;1;Glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe's Disease) is a disease that causes glycogen to accumulate in lysosomes.
Glycogen storage disease type II;2;It I done of the rarest diseases in India.
Gastritis;1;Gastritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach.
Gastritis;2;It has many possible causes.
Gastritis;3;The main causes are drinking too much alcohol, or using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also known as NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen for too long.
Gastritis;4;Sometimes gastritis starts after major surgery, serious injury, burns, or infections.
Gastritis;5;People who have had weight loss surgery may also get gastritis.
Gastritis;6;Long term causes are infection with bacteria, mainly Helicobacter pylori.
Gastritis;7;Certain diseases, such as pernicious anemia, chronic bile reflux, stress and certain autoimmune disorders can cause gastritis as well.
Gastritis;8;The most common symptom is abdominal pain.
Gastritis;9;Other symptoms are indigestion, abdominal bloating, nausea, and vomiting.
Gastritis;10;Some may have a feeling of fullness or burning in the upper abdomen.
Gastritis;11;A gastroscopy, blood test, complete blood count test, or a faeces test may be used to diagnose gastritis.
Gastritis;12;Treatment includes taking antacids or other medicines, such as proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics, and avoiding hot or spicy foods.
Gastritis;13;For those with pernicious anemia, B  injections are given.
Osteoarthritis;1;Osteoarthritis normally affects older people: it is a disease where joints wear out.
Osteoarthritis;2;As the joint surface wears away, it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid.
Osteoarthritis;3;This causes the joint to swell.
Osteoarthritis;4;When the joint cartilage wears away, the core of the bone becomes exposed.
Osteoarthritis;5;The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone.
Osteoarthritis;6;Joints will be stiff and painful, and may be swollen.
Osteoarthritis;7;The pain may be worse after exercise.
Osteoarthritis;8;It may get harder to move the joint.
Cerebral palsy;1;Cerebral palsy (CP) is the name given to a number of motor problems (trouble moving the body).
Cerebral palsy;2;CP is usually caused by damage done to the brain during early childhood.
Cerebral palsy;3;"It is called "" cerebral palsy "" because the part of the brain that is damaged is the cerebrum."
Cerebral palsy;4;CP cannot be cured.
Cerebral palsy;5;It is treated with therapies.
Cerebral palsy;6;CP was first identified by an English surgeon called William Little in 1860.
Cerebral palsy;7;There are several types of cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy;8;The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy;9;Today, 1 in every 400 children in the UK has cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy;10;People with CP often have trouble standing or walking.
Cerebral palsy;11;They may also be partly paralysed.
Cerebral palsy;12;While the main problem of cerebral palsy is problems with moving, difficulties with having thoughts, learning, feeling, talking and behaviour often come with cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy;13;Of children with cerebral palsy, 3 out of 4 children have pain, 1 out of 2 have intellectual disability, 1 out of 3 children cannot walk, 1 in 3 have a hip displacement, 1 in 4 cannot talk, 1 out of 4 children have epilepsy, 1 in 4 have behaviour disorders, 1 out of 4 children have trouble controlling their bladder, 1 in 5 have trouble with sleep (sleeping too much or not enough), 1 out of 5 children dribble, 1 out of 10 are blind, 1 out of 15 need to be fed through a tube, and 1 in 25 are deaf.
Cerebral palsy;14;Most people with cerebral palsy live for as long as people without CP.
Cerebral palsy;15;5-10% of children with CP die before growing up.
Cerebral palsy;16;Over time, the way to take care of cerebral palsy has changed from fixing a person's physical problems such as spasticity in one leg or arm.
Cerebral palsy;17;Now, the way to take care of cerebral palsy is about making therapies for the body part of a larger purpose of making the person's quality of life better, helping them have choice and make their own decisions about looking after themselves, and helping them be part of society.
Cerebral palsy;18;Much of children's therapy is about helping them walk better.
Cerebral palsy;19;Roughly 60% of people with CP are able to walk by themselves or with mobility aids when they become grown up.
Cerebral palsy;20;Mobility aids may help people with CP move around more easily.
Dysgraphia;1;People who never learned how to read and write are called illiterate.
Dysgraphia;2;Dysgraphia or agraphia is the inability to write texts, even though the person has the necessary motoric skills.
Dysgraphia;3;People with dysgraphia can move their hand enough, and are also capable of understanding how to write.
Dysgraphia;4;Dysgraphias occur because of damage done to the brain.
Dysgraphia;5;They often occur with other illnesses, such as speech problems.
Dysgraphia;6;Many people who suffered a stroke may have lost the ability to move parts of their body.
Dysgraphia;7;There are different forms of dysgraphia:   Lexical agraphia: words that are hard to tell apart cannot be written down properly   Phonological agraphia: words can be written down correctly, but they cannot be pronounced   Semantic agraphia: words with a certain meaning cannot be pronounced   Apractical agraphia: The motor skills can no longer be used for writing   Dyslexia
Amoebiasis;1;Amoebiasis, also known as amebiasis or entamoebiasis, is an intestinal infection caused by amoebas of the Entamoeba group.
Amoebiasis;2;The infection is usually caused by Entamoeba histolytica.
Amoebiasis;3;The infection is normally got when someone drinks water with the parasite in it.
Amoebiasis;4;In some cases, the parasite lives in a person's large intestine and does not cause any symptoms.
Amoebiasis;5;Symptoms vary from serious to none at all.
Amoebiasis;6;There may be abdominal pain, mild diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea or severe colitis with tissue death and perforation.
Amoebiasis;7;This last complication may cause peritonitis.
Amoebiasis;8;People affected may develop anaemia due to loss of blood.
Amoebiasis;9;Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by water contaminated with faeces.
Amoebiasis;10;It can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects.
Amoebiasis;11;Infection is spread by ingesting the cyst form of the parasite.
Amoebiasis;12;This tough and semi-dormant structure is found in faeces.
Amoebiasis;13;Since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in parts of the world with poor sanitation (such as México, Central America, western South America, South Asia, and western and southern Africa).
Amoebiasis;14;"Amoebic dysentery is often confused with "" traveller's diarrhoea "" because of its prevalence in developing nations."
Amoebiasis;15;In fact, most traveller's diarrhoea is bacterial or viral in origin.
Amoebiasis;16;E. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver.
Amoebiasis;17;So, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location.
Amoebiasis;18;Such anti-amoebic drugs are known as amoebicides.

Foot-and-mouth disease;1;Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the acute infectious diseases (highly contagious disease) of animals.
Foot-and-mouth disease;2;Foot-and-mouth disease virus causes the disease which can infect domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer.
Foot-and-mouth disease;3;Generally, it is believed that FMD is not very contagious to humans.
Foot-and-mouth disease;4;However, humans can spread FMD by carrying the virus on their clothes and body.
Foot-and-mouth disease;5;FMD breaks out all over the globe, because it is highly contagious to many animals.
Foot-and-mouth disease;6;The earliest description of FMD was that by Hieronymi Fracastorii (1546).
Foot-and-mouth disease;7;He described the disease, as being unusual and affecting only cattle, when it occurred in northern Italy in 1514.
Foot-and-mouth disease;8;While the disease is widespread around the world, North America, Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Chile, and many countries in Europe are considered free of FMD.
Foot-and-mouth disease;9;Various types of FMD virus have been found in Africa, South America, Asia, and some parts of Europe.
Foot-and-mouth disease;10;The most obvious signs of Foot and Mouth Disease are excessive slobbering (letting liquid fall from their mouth), a lack of appetite and lameness (unable to walk properly because of damage to one or both of their legs).
Foot-and-mouth disease;11;Affected animals may experience a sudden rise in temperature, sores in the mouth or other areas.
Foot-and-mouth disease;12;Slobbering and smacking lips   Shivering   Tender and sore feet   Reduced milk yield   Sores and blisters on feet   Raised temperature   Sudden lameness   Prefers to lie down   Sore on the upper edge of the hoof, where the skin and horn meet, and on the heels   FMD is caused by a virus.
Foot-and-mouth disease;13;Signs of illness can appear after an incubation period (the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear) of one to eight days, but often develop within three days.
Foot-and-mouth disease;14;Immunity to one type does not protect an animal against other types.
Toxic shock syndrome;1;Toxic shock syndrome or TSS is a non-common, deadly infection caused by toxins from bacteria.
Toxic shock syndrome;2;Toxic shock syndrome is usually caused by Staphylococcus bacteria, but it can also be caused by Streptococcus bacteria.
Toxic shock syndrome;3;Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome can show up suddenly, and the disease can be deadly.
Toxic shock syndrome;4;The symptoms are different when the toxic shock syndrome is caused by different bacteria.
Toxic shock syndrome;5;When it is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, the symptoms are generally high fever, low blood pressure, confusion, and malaise.
Toxic shock syndrome;6;If the disease is not treated, someone with toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus aureus can go into a coma.
Toxic shock syndrome;7;When toxic shock syndrome is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, it usually is a rash that was already there getting worse.
Toxic shock syndrome;8;People with toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes have pain where the rash is, then the symptoms below happen very quickly.
Toxic shock syndrome;9;The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome include:   A high fever that starts quickly   Low blood pressure   Vomiting or diarrhea   A rash that looks like a sunburn, mostly on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet   Confusion   Muscle pain   Redness of the eyes, mouth, and throat   Seizures   Headaches   Toxic shock syndrome can be caused by many things.
Toxic shock syndrome;10;The most common reasons are injuries to the skin that allow bacteria to get into the bloodstream and tampons.
Toxic shock syndrome;11;Many people with toxic shock syndrome have to stay in the hospital.
Toxic shock syndrome;12;If it is very bad, they might have to go to the intensive care unit so that doctors can make sure that they are getting good care.
Toxic shock syndrome;13;If the reason that they have toxic shock syndrome is because of tampon use, doctors will make sure that they take the tampon out.
Toxic shock syndrome;14;If the reason that they have toxic shock syndrome is an injury (an abscess or other infection), the injury has to be drained.
Toxic shock syndrome;15;Antibiotics like cephalosporin, penicillin, and vancomycin are used to stop the bacteria from growing.
Toxic shock syndrome;16;Clindamycin and gentamicin stop the toxins from being produced.
Toxic shock syndrome;17;In 1978, Procter and Gamble (a United States company that sells many different products) started selling tampons called Rely.
Toxic shock syndrome;18;Rely tampons could be left in for a whole menstrual cycle, which is from 2 to 8 days.
Toxic shock syndrome;19;Women who used Rely tampons sometimes got toxic shock syndrome because of this.
Toxic shock syndrome;20;Other tampons that are left in for a long time can also cause toxic shock syndrome.
Binge eating;1;Binge eating is a disease characterized by episodes of compulsive overeating.
Binge eating;2;It has the following characteristics:   #People eat too much.
Binge eating;3;This is known as overeating.
Binge eating;4;When this happens, they often lose control, and cannot stop.
Binge eating;5;#Very often, they eat more food than other people in the same time.
Binge eating;6;#People feel very painful and distraught while they eat or after eating.
Binge eating;7;#People want to make up the consequences of binge eating by some inappropriate and unhealthy ways.
Binge eating;8;The vicious cycle of binge eating   It can make people feel satisfied for a while, but after that, they will feel guilty and they will regret eating so much.
Binge eating;9;People overeat to feel better, but they actually feel worse, and go back to overeating for relief, forming a vicious cycle.
Binge eating;10;Other characteristics:   If binge eating becomes a pattern, this is an eating disorder.
Binge eating;11;People who suffer from this have a high risk of weight gain.
Binge eating;12;They may feel ashamed of their eating habits and become depressed.
Binge eating;13;People who binge and then purge, (usually by vomiting), have a different eating disorder called bulimia.
Binge eating;14;People with anorexia may also binge and purge.
Precancerous condition;1;A precancerous (or premalignant) condition is not malignant.
Precancerous condition;2;However, it has the potential to become cancer if proper treatment is not taken in time.
Precancerous condition;3;A premalignant lesion is a visually (morphologically) altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than its normal counterpart.
Precancerous condition;4;The condition was named in 1875 by Romanian physician Victor Babeş.
Lactose intolerance;1;Lactose intolerance is when a person cannot digest milk or milk products (such as cheese or yogurt).
Lactose intolerance;2;Lactose is a disaccharide sugar (double sugar molecule), which must be split (digested) into two simple sugars (monosaccharides), glucose and galactose.
Lactose intolerance;3;An enzyme called lactase is needed to break it down.
Lactose intolerance;4;People with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities.
Lactose intolerance;5;Because of this they are unable to digest lactose.
Lactose intolerance;6;Up to 75% of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults.
Lactose intolerance;7;This loss of ability ranges from 5% in northern Europe, to over 71% in Sicily and to over 90% in parts of Africa and Asia.
Lactose intolerance;8;There is no cure for lactose intolerance.
Lactose intolerance;9;People need to change their diet to only include food with very little lactose.
Lactose intolerance;10;There are many milk substitutes.
Lactose intolerance;11;Milk is not a fermented product.
Lactose intolerance;12;If is not digested, then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy.
Lactose intolerance;13;Amino acids are changed to other substances, which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy.
Lactose intolerance;14;Lactose intolerance is not the same as milk allergy, which is an immune reaction to some of the proteins in milk.
Lactose intolerance;15;Normally infant mammals drink their mother's milk.
Lactose intolerance;16;Then the gene which causes the body to make lactase is switched off, and the young move on to adult food.
Lactose intolerance;17;They can no longer digest milk.
Lactose intolerance;18;Humans are somewhat different from other mammals.
Lactose intolerance;19;Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not.
Lactose intolerance;20;It is a type of genetic polymorphism.
Lactose intolerance;21;The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry.
Lactose intolerance;22;People kept animals which could provide milk.
Lactose intolerance;23;Hunter-gatherer people before the Neolithic revolution were mostly lactose intolerant.
Lactose intolerance;24;So are modern hunter-gatherers.
Lactose intolerance;25;A mutation on chromosome 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production.
Lactose intolerance;26;This makes it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.
Lactose intolerance;27;This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy products.
Lactose intolerance;28;It occurred in both northern Europe and east Africa in people with a historically pastoral lifestyle.
Lactose intolerance;29;Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait.
Lactose intolerance;30;Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence have only become common in human populations in the last 10,000 years.
Lactose intolerance;31;Because of this, lactase persistence is often given as an example of recent human evolution.
Lactose intolerance;32;As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution.
Sirenomelia;1;Sirenomelia, also known as Mermaid Syndrome, is a very rare disorder in which the legs are stuck together, making them look like a mermaid's tail.
Sirenomelia;2;This, however, is as rare as conjoined twins, and only happens to one out of every 100,000 live births.
Sirenomelia;3;It is usually very bad for the kidney and bladder, and only about four survivors were known to be alive as of July 2003.
Hernia;1;A hernia is a medical condition.
Hernia;2;If an organ or its tissue moves from its normal position through to another position, this is called a hernia.
Hernia;3;There are various types of hernia.
Hernia;4;Most hernias happen in the abdomen.
Hernia;5;Hernias sometimes give pain and/or a lump that can be felt or seen.
Hernia;6;The cause can be hereditary or it can be from lifting objects especially heavy ones – in a wrong way.
Hernia;7;There are other things that can give hernias as well.
Hernia;8;Hernias especially if small or mild can be treated with medicine but will not take off although it wi relieve symptoms.
Liver failure;1;Liver failure or Hepatic failure is when the liver is no longer able to work.
Liver failure;2;Things the liver does include making proteins.
Liver failure;3;Liver failure can either be acute or chronic.
Liver failure;4;Alcoholism   Paracetamol
Yaws;1;Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints.
Yaws;2;It is caused by the spirochaete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue.
Yaws;3;The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, two to five centimeters in diameter.
Yaws;4;The center may break open and form an ulcer.
Yaws;5;This usually heals after three to six months.
Yaws;6;After several weeks, or even years later, the joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin sores may appear.
Yaws;7;The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open.
Yaws;8;The bones (especially those of the nose) may change shape.
Yaws;9;After five years or more large areas of skin can die.
Yaws;10;This leaves large scars.
Yaws;11;Yaws is spread by touching the fluid from the sores of a person with the disease.
Yaws;12;The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together.
Yaws;13;Other similar diseases are caused by different strains of the same bacterium, such as syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum).
Yaws;14;Once the lesions have appeared doctors are able to tell it is yaws.
Yaws;15;Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best method of diagnosis.
Yaws;16;The main way of stopping the disease spreading, is by curing those who have it.
Yaws;17;This stops them passing it on to others.
Yaws;18;Where the disease is common, treating the entire community is effective.
Yaws;19;Improving cleanliness and sanitation will also decrease spread.
Yaws;20;Yaws can be treated with antibiotics.
Yaws;21;Without treatment, physical deformities happen in 10% of cases.
Yaws;22;Yaws is common in at least 14 tropical countries as of 2012.
Yaws;23;The disease infects only humans.
Yaws;24;In the 1950s and 1960s the World Health Organization (WHO) nearly destroyed yaws.
Yaws;25;Since then the number of cases has increased.
Yaws;26;One of the first descriptions of the disease was made in 1679 by Willem Piso.
Yaws;27;Archaeology shows that yaws may have been present among humans as far back as 1.6 million years ago.
False pregnancy;1;A false pregnancy, hysterical pregnancy or pseudopregnancy is when a mammal shows some of the symptoms associated with a pregnancy, but without being pregnant.
False pregnancy;2;False pregnancies commonly occur in dogs and mice.
False pregnancy;3;False pregnancy in humans is less common, and usually has psychological causes.
False pregnancy;4;False pregnancy is probably caused by changes in the endocrine system of the body, which leads to the secretion of hormones.
False pregnancy;5;These hormones are the reason physical changes happen, similar to those during pregnancy.
False pregnancy;6;The underlying cause is often mental.
Q fever;1;Q fever is a disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, bacteria that affect humans and other animals.
Q fever;2;It is not common but can be found in cattle, sheep, goats, and other household animals, including cats and dogs.
Q fever;3;People can get infected if they inhale endospores or touch the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals.
Q fever;4;The disease is rarely carried by ticks.
Q fever;5;A human can be infected by a single bacterium.
Q fever;6;Q fever at the CDC
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;1;Oculocerebrorenal syndrome (also called Lowe Syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder in humans.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;2;It affects the eyes, the brain and the kidneys.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;3;It is also known as Oculocerebrorenal syndrome.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;4;People with lowe syndrome are born with cataracts, that is the lenses of their eyes are not totally clear.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;5;Many people with the syndrome develop kidney problems at an early age.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;6;The brain develops differently, the development of the child happens slower.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;7;Such children may often have learning difficulties.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;8;Epilepsy can also occur.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;9;The disorder is caused by a gene defect on the X-chromosome.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;10;As a result, much more boys are affected than girls.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;11;The syndrome is named after Dr. Charles Lowe, who first described it in 1952.
Oculocerebrorenal syndrome;12;Its occurrence is about one case in half a million live births.
Frostbite;1;Frostbite is the localized medical condition where very cold temperatures damage skin and other tissue.
Frostbite;2;It is most likely to happen in body parts farthest from the heart and in body parts with large exposed areas with many blood circulations.
Frostbite;3;It most often occurs in toes.
Frostbite;4;Also, if the affected parts are not amputated, the person is likely to suffer from a disease called gangrene.
Sleepwalking;1;Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, is a disorder belonging to the parasomnia family of sleeping problems.
Sleepwalking;2;People with this disorder leave bed, without waking up, and walk around.
Sleepwalking;3;In certain cases, people do things they also do in everyday life.
Sleepwalking;4;According to research done, sleepwalking seems to be a problem related to the mechanism of waking up.
Sleepwalking;5;The activities can be as simple as sitting up in bed, walking to the bathroom, and cleaning.
Sleepwalking;6;"Sometimes they are dangerous; examples include cooking, driving, extremely violent gesture or grabbing at hallucinated objects, or even homicide."
Sleepwalking;7;"Generally, sleepwalking cases consist of simple, repeated behaviours; occasionally there are reports of people performing complex behaviours while asleep, but the legitimacy of these claims is often disputed."
Sleepwalking;8;In 2004, sleep medicine experts in Australia claimed to have successfully treated a woman who claimed to have sex with strangers in her sleep.
Sleepwalking;9;In December 2008, reports were published of a woman who sent semi-coherent emails while sleepwalking, including one inviting a friend around for dinner and drinks.
Sleepwalking;10;Sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the what they do, because they are not truly conscious.
Sleepwalking;11;Their eyes are open, but their expression is dim and glazed over.
Sleepwalking;12;Sleepwalking may last as little as 30 seconds or as long as thirty minutes.
Sleepwalking;13;There is no data about how common sleepwalking is.
Sleepwalking;14;Estimates say that one to two percent of adults are sleepwalkers.
Sleepwalking;15;"Sleepwalking seems to be more common in children, between ten and thirty percent of children are affected; in most cases, they stop sleepwalking during puberty."
Sleepwalking;16;Most cases of sleepwalking are temporary, they occur once, or only a few times.
Sleepwalking;17;"It looks like some sleepwalking may be inherited; very often, people who are sleepwalkers have other sleepwalkers in the family."
Sleepwalking;18;Because people can hurt themselves while sleepwalking, it is a good idea to either wake a sleepwalker, or to guide the person back to bed.
Sleepwalking;19;There are drugs that can be given to treat the condition.
Sleepwalking;20;As there is no therapy, many experts are against the use of drugs.
Leukodystrophy;1;Leukodystrophies are disorders which affect the white matter of the brain and the nervous system.
Leukodystrophy;2;Nerves are surrounded by fatty cover of a substance called myelin.
Leukodystrophy;3;In a leukodystrophy, there are problems with the growth or the development of this cover.
Leukodystrophy;4;This affects the function of the respective nerve.
Leukodystrophy;5;Myelin is made of at least ten different chemicals.
Leukodystrophy;6;Leukodystrophy is a gene defect.
Leukodystrophy;7;As a result of this defect, one of the molecules that make up myelin cannot be synthesized as it should.

Achondroplasia;1;Achondroplasia is a form of Dwarfism.
Achondroplasia;2;It is part of the chondrodystrophies or osteochondrodysplasias family which makes bones in a human's skeleton be too short or grow too slowly.
Achondroplasia;3;It often affects the femur and humerus.
Achondroplasia;4;It is caused by a dominant allele.
Achondroplasia;5;That means only one parent has to have the gene.
Achondroplasia;6;This gives a child a 50% chance of getting the condition.
Achondroplasia;7;If both parents have the gene the chances are increased to 75%, but in 25% of the cases, it is very unlikely that the child would live more than a few months.
Achondroplasia;8;However, the condition can also occur without either parent having the gene.
Achondroplasia;9;Achondroplasia is caused by a change in the DNA for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.
Achondroplasia;10;This change affects the making of cartilage.
Achondroplasia;11;Now that the part of the DNA that causes the condition is known, there is hope that new treatments may be developed.
Chagas disease;1;Chagas disease is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi.
Chagas disease;2;The disease is also known as American trypanosomiasis.
Chagas disease;3;It is common in Central and South America.
Chagas disease;4;Carlos Chagas first described it in 1909.
Chagas disease;5;Humans are usually infected because they are bitten by a blood-sucking bug of the subfamily Triatominae.
Chagas disease;6;The disease can also be spread by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or by eating food contaminated with the parasite.
Chagas disease;7;Pregnant women may spread it to the fetus.
Chagas disease;8;The disease has four stages.
Chagas disease;9;It can be cured by anti-parasitic drugs.
Chagas disease;10;Between eight and eleven million people may suffer from the disease, but many do not know they are infected.
Chagas disease;11;Strategies of controlling the disease are mostly focused on eliminating the insect vector, and on preventing contamination from other sources.
Trypanosomiasis;1;"Trypanosomiasis is the name for several diseases, caused by parasites of the genus Tryposoma:   African typanosomiasis or Sleeping sickness, caused by 'Trypanosoma brucei and spread by the Tsetse fly   American typanosomiasis or Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and spread by various bloodsucking bugs of the subfamily Triatominae   There are also various diseases that only affect animals, caused by such parasites, amongst others:   Nagana, or Animal African trypanosomiasis; the animal counterpart of sleeping sickness   Surra   Covering sickness or douring (which affects horses)"
African trypanosomiasis;1;REDIRECT Sleeping sickness
Lead poisoning;1;Lead poisoning is a condition where there is too much lead in the body.
Lead poisoning;2;Lead interferes with many processes, and is toxic to many organs and tissues.
Lead poisoning;3;Treatment of the condition is usually focused on removing the source of lead.
Type 2 diabetes;1;Diabetes mellitus type 2 (or adult-onset diabetes) is a metabolic disorder where high levels of blood sugar occur.
Type 2 diabetes;2;Left untreated, it can cause heart attacks, strokes, blindness and kidney failure.
Type 2 diabetes;3;Usually, blood sugar levels are regulated by insulin, but in type 2 diabetes this does not work properly.
Type 2 diabetes;4;Insulin is a hormone which tells the muscle and fat cells of the body to take up sugar from the blood.
Type 2 diabetes;5;If there is too much sugar in the blood for a long period of time, the muscle and fat cells start to ignore insulin.
Type 2 diabetes;6;As a result, sugar stays in the blood and is not taken up, leading to a high blood sugar.
Type 2 diabetes;7;This situation is different from diabetes mellitus type 1.
Type 2 diabetes;8;In this case, the islet cells, which make insulin in the pancreas, have been destroyed by the body, and as a result there is no insulin.
Type 2 diabetes;9;Diabetes type 1 usually occurs in children or young adults, whilst diabetes type 2 usually occurs in older people.
Type 2 diabetes;10;However, recently childhood obesity has led to some young adults and teenagers developing type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes;11;Type 2 diabetes makes up around 90% of cases of diabetes, while type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes make up the other 10%.
Type 2 diabetes;12;Type 2 diabetes is a result of both genetics and lifestyle.
Type 2 diabetes;13;People who have relatives with diabetes type 2 are at an increased risk.
Type 2 diabetes;14;They may develop diabetes if they have other risk factors in their lifestyle, for example obesity or low amount of exercise.
Type 2 diabetes;15;Poorly managed diabetes can lead to heart attacks, strokes, blindness and kidney failure.
Type 2 diabetes;16;Type 2 diabetes can often be treated just by losing weight and exercising more, as these increase the body’s sensitivity to insulin.
Type 2 diabetes;17;A medicine called Metformin is often prescribed, which works by helping the fat and muscle cells of the body listen to the signal from insulin to take up sugar from the blood.
Ovarian cancer;1;Ovarian cancer is cancer that involves different regions of the ovary.
Ovarian cancer;2;Recent evidence suggests the Fallopian tube may be related to the cancer.
Ovarian cancer;3;Other types of this condition involve egg cells.
Ovarian cancer;4;The risk increases with age and decreases with pregnancy.
Ovarian cancer;5;Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for females, and the survival rates for this condition vary.
Endometrial cancer;1;Endometrial cancer is cancer in the endometrium (lining of the uterus).
Endometrial cancer;2;The cancer is usually diagnosed during its early stages, resulting in a better survival rate than most cancers.
Endometrial cancer;3;Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States: over 35,000 women are diagnosed each year.
Blister;1;Blisters are small pockets of fluid in an upper layer of the skin caused by friction, burning or freezing.
Blister;2;Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid called serum or plasma (blister water).
Blister;3;"Some blisters, however, are filled with blood; they are called blood blisters."
Hypoglycemia;1;Hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that involves lower than normal blood sugar.
Hypoglycemia;2;Normal blood sugar is about 70 to 100mg per deciliter.
Hypoglycemia;3;All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive.
Hypoglycemia;4;When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally.
Hypoglycemia;5;Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms.
Hypoglycemia;6;Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding).
Hypoglycemia;7;Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs.
Hypoglycemia;8;Very bad hypoglycemia can look exactly like a stroke.
Hypoglycemia;9;Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic.
Hypoglycemia;10;It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications.
Hypoglycemia;11;Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal.
Hypoglycemia;12;Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating.
Hypoglycemia;13;In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein).
Hypoglycemia;14;The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar.
Hypoglycemia;15;Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough.
Neuroblastoma;1;Neuroblastoma is a kind of cancer that usually happchens to children and infants.
Neuroblastoma;2;This kind of cancer mostly affects the Autonomic nervous system.
Neuroblastoma;3;The cancer creates tumors, but the cells (pieces) of the tumors do not fully finish growing.
Neuroblastoma;4;There are about 650 cases per year in the United States.
Neuroblastoma;5;About half of these cases occur in children younger than two years old.
Neuroblastoma;6;The tumors can grow from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system.
Neuroblastoma;7;Most of the time, it comes from one of the adrenal glands.
Neuroblastoma;8;It can also start growing in nerve tissues in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Neuroblastoma;9;Neuroblastoma is one of the few malignant types of cancer that sometimes goes away on its own, for no obvious reason.
Neuroblastoma;10;The illness can have many different forms.
Neuroblastoma;11;There are three risk categories (types): low, intermediate (medium), and high risk.
Neuroblastoma;12;Low-risk disease is most common in infants, who usually get better, though they may need to have surgery.
Neuroblastoma;13;High-risk disease is very difficult for doctors to make better.
Neuroblastoma;14;"Esthesioneuroblastoma, which is also called "" olfactory neuroblastoma "" , comes from the olfactory epithelium and doctors are still not sure what type of cancer it is."
Neuroblastoma;15;It is not a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, and is not the same thing as neuroblastoma.
Freckle;1;Freckles are clusters of concentrated melanin that are most often visible with a fair skin complexion.
Freckle;2;Freckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun, such as the lips, neck, arms, shoulders, back, chest and gluteus maximus.
Freckle;3;They are an inherited trait, caused by variation in the MC1R gene that is involved in the determination of red hair, fair skin, and freckles.
Freckle;4;Freckle formation is triggered through exposure to sunlight.
Freckle;5;Two types of melanin, the red pheomelanin and the black eumelanin, are present in human skin.
Freckle;6;Eumelanin protects against sunlight.
Freckle;7;People with red hair have mostly pheomelanin in their hair and skin and/or a reduced ability to produce eumelanin.
Freckle;8;This may explain why they fail to tan and are at risk from the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight.
Freckle;9;About 2.5 billion people in the world have freckles.
Freckle;10;About 75 per cent of Filipino people have freckles.
Prostatitis;1;Prostatitis is any form of inflammation of the prostate gland.
Prostatitis;2;Because women do not have a prostate gland, it is a condition only found in men, although women do have microscopic paraurethral Skene's glands connected to the distal third of the urethra in the prevaginal space that are homologous to the prostate, and may cause symptoms.
Prostatitis;3;A prostatitis diagnosis is assigned at 8% of all urologist and 1% of all primary care physician visits in the USA.
Prostatitis;4;The term prostatitis refers in its strictest sense to histological (microscopic) inflammation of the tissue of the prostate gland, although historically the term has loosely been used as a rubric to describe a set of quite different conditions.
Prostatitis;5;To try to remedy this, the NIH devised a new classification system in 1999.
Prostatitis;6;According to the 1999 National Institute of Health (NIH) Classification, there are four categories of prostatitis:   Category I:   Category II:   Category III:   ::    Category IV:   Men with this disease often have chills, fever, pain in the lower back and genital area, urinary frequency and urgency often at night, burning or painful urination, body aches, and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract, as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine.
Prostatitis;7;There may be discharge from the penis.
Prostatitis;8;Acute prostatitis is relatively easy to diagnose due to its symptoms that suggest infection.
Prostatitis;9;Common bacteria are E. Coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Serratia, and Staphylococcus aureus.
Prostatitis;10;This can be a medical emergency in some patients and hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics may be required.
Prostatitis;11;A full blood count reveals increased white blood cells.
Prostatitis;12;"Sepsis from prostatitis is very rare, but may occur in immunocompromised patients; high fever and malaise generally prompt blood cultures, which are often positive in sepsis."
Prostatitis;13;Antibiotics are the first line of treatment in acute prostatitis (Cat.
Prostatitis;15;Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short period of time.
Prostatitis;16;Appropriate antibiotics should be used, based on the microbe causing the infection.
Prostatitis;17;Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule, others, such as Ciprofloxacin, Co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines penetrate well.
Prostatitis;18;Severely ill patients may need hospitalization, while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest, analgesics, stool softeners, and hydration.
Prostatitis;19;Full recovery without sequelae is usual.
Prostatitis;20;"Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a relatively rare condition (    Pelvic Myoneuropathy   Quercetin (alternative medicine- a flavonoid which has anti-inflammatory properties; found in various foods)   Trigger Points   Saw Palmetto (alternative medicine- a small North American palm, used by American Indians for treating a variety of urinary and genital problems."

Stereotypic movement disorder;1;People with stereotypic movement disorder often hurt themselves.
Stereotypic movement disorder;2;Some people make behaviors such as keeping their hands in their pockets, to prevent these movements.
Stereotypic movement disorder;3;Cause of stereotypic movement disorder is certain physical conditions, head injuries and use of some drugs (cocaine).
Stereotypic movement disorder;4;Childhood habits can result in negative social interactions and avoidance by peers and family members.
Stereotypic movement disorder;5;Some repetitive behaviors can cause damage.
Stereotypic movement disorder;6;The most common treatment approaches used for children with this condition are therapies aimed at reducing stress that may trigger the movements and changing behaviors.
Stereotypic movement disorder;7;Some medications may also help reduce stereotypic behavior.
Stereotypic movement disorder;8;Naltrexone has been used with some success in reducing stereotypic self-injurious behavior.
Stereotypic movement disorder;9;In some cases, antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft and Luvox (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), or Anafranil (a tricyclic antidepressant) may be helpful.
Schizophreniform disorder;1;Schizophreniform disorder is a mental illness.
Schizophreniform disorder;2;Usually, people suffering from this disorder show certain symptoms of schizophrenia, but they do not have all of them, or the symptoms are not present long enough.
Schizophreniform disorder;3;To be recognised as schizophrenia, the symptoms need to be present a full six months.
Schizophreniform disorder;4;If symptoms are not present for that time period, the illness may be classified as shizophreniform disorder.
Schizophreniform disorder;5;The disorder can be treated in much the same way as schizophrenia.
Schizophreniform disorder;6;There are certain antipsychotic drugs and therapies that can help treat the symptoms.

Agoraphobia;1;Agoraphobia is a medical condition that causes anxiety.
Agoraphobia;2;Sufferers are afraid of large open spaces, crowds, and new places.
Agoraphobia;3;Many doctors believe that people with the condition are afraid of becoming anxious.
Agoraphobia;4;Places that make them feel unsafe and increase their feelings of anxiety and panic.
Agoraphobia;5;They may be afraid they might lose control and embarrass themselves.
Agoraphobia;6;They worry that they may not be able to get away, or find help if they have a panic attack.
Agoraphobia;7;"The word agoraphobia means "" fear of the market place "" ."
Agoraphobia;8;People with agoraphobia often believe that their home is the only safe place.
Agoraphobia;9;Extreme sufferers may be unable to leave their homes for months or in some cases years.
Agoraphobia;10;Agoraphobia is sometimes treated successfully with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, but some people never recover.
Agoraphobia;11;"People with agoraphobia may show these signs and symptoms:   Anxiety in "" unsafe "" places   Being short of breath   Sweating   Dizziness   Fast heartbeat   Nausea   Feelings of extreme fear   Feeling anxious if they know they will have to leave their safe place (such as their home)   Low self-esteem   Loss of self-confidence   Do not want to visit new places   Depression"
Graves' disease;1;Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid.
Graves' disease;2;In people affected by the disease, the thyroid produces a bigger quantity of hormones than normal, which is commonly known as hyperthyroidism.
Graves' disease;3;It occurs more often in women than men.
Polydactyly;1;Polydactyly is a birth defect which may affects the hands, feet, or both.
Polydactyly;2;It causes one or more extra fingers or toes.
Polydactyly;3;It can affect people, and other mammals such as dogs, and cats.
Night terror;1;A night terror, also known as a sleep terror, is a sleep disorder that causes extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full consciousness.
Night terror;2;The person having the night terror wakes up suddenly, usually gasping, moaning, or screaming while waking.
Night terror;3;It is often impossible to wake up the person fully because they are so concentrated on waking, and after the terror the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking.
Night terror;4;A night terror can rarely be recalled by the subject.
Night terror;5;They typically occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep.

Dyssomnia;1;REDIRECT Sleep disorder
Parasomnia;1;Parasomias are sleep disorders that interrupt sleep.
Parasomnia;2;They can be broadly classified:   Problems with arousal (NREM sleep): Sleepwalking and night terrors (Pavor nocturnus)   Problems associated with REM sleep: Nightmares, sleep paralysis   Other problems, including for example hallucinations, or eating disorders.
Hemorrhoid;1;Hemorrhoid or haemorrhoid (also commonly called piles) are vascular structures (similar to veins) in the anal canal which help with stool evacuation.
Hemorrhoid;2;We only speak of hemorrhoids (or piles) when they become swollen or inflamed.
Hemorrhoid;3;But Hemorrhoids are a normal part of the anatomy and everyone has these structures.
Hemorrhoid;4;They act as a cushion that is made of complex tissue.
Hemorrhoid;5;Their job is to aid the passage of stool.
Hemorrhoid;6;Hemorrhoids are very common.
Hemorrhoid;7;Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time.
Hemorrhoid;8;It is not known what causes hemorrhoids, but doctors often speak of several main factors.
Hemorrhoid;9;These factors include chronic constipation or diarrhea, sitting on the toilet for a long time and straining during defecation.
Hemorrhoid;10;Hemorrhoids may also appear because of sports.
Hemorrhoid;11;When something heavy is lifted, additional pressure is applied on the area.
Hemorrhoid;12;Women are in danger of having hemorrhoids during pregnancy.
Hemorrhoid;13;This also happens due to increased pressure from the baby.
Hemorrhoid;14;Hemorrhoids are more likely with aging because the tissue becomes weaker.
Hemorrhoid;15;Some people are more likely to get hemorrhoids if other family members have them.
Hemorrhoid;16;According to their anatomical origin hemorrhoids can be two types - internal and external.
Hemorrhoid;17;Internal hemorrhoids originate from inside the anus.
Hemorrhoid;18;But internal hemorrhoids can also go down and show outside the anus.
Hemorrhoid;19;In this case, medical professionals are talking about prolapse.
Hemorrhoid;20;Symptoms of internal hemorrhoids include itching, bleeding, swelling, mucus discharge, burning sensation, prolapse, and soiling.
Hemorrhoid;21;Patients also complain of general discomfort while sitting, feeling of fullness and presence of a foreign body inside the anus.
Hemorrhoid;22;Internal hemorrhoids can only cause painless bleeding from the anus, while external hemorrhoids are painful.
Hemorrhoid;23;External hemorrhoids are located on the outside of the anus.
Hemorrhoid;24;They look like a bluish lump.
Hemorrhoid;25;But sometimes internal hemorrhoids can also become extremely painful.
Hemorrhoid;26;This happens because they develop a clot.
Hemorrhoid;27;In these cases, a thrombosed hemorrhoid occurs and it may have to be operated.
Hemorrhoid;28;Pain in the area around the anus may be due to another disease, such as anal fissure, anal fistula, or proctitis.
Hemorrhoid;29;Hemorrhoids are diagnosed by a doctor.
Hemorrhoid;30;A visual examination of the anus is usually needed.
Hemorrhoid;31;The doctor may want to perform a rectal examination which will help detect internal hemorrhoids, tumours, polyps, or abscesses.
Hemorrhoid;32;The visual examination usually requires a special device, called anoscope to be inserted in the anus.
Hemorrhoid;33;The procedure is painless unless another disease is presented.
Hemorrhoid;34;Treatment of hemorrhoids can be done at home or in the hospital.
Hemorrhoid;35;Usually, the best option is to prevent getting them.
Hemorrhoid;36;This can be done by keeping the stools soft and bulk, so they pass easily during defecation.
Hemorrhoid;37;Stools can be made softer and larger by increasing fiber intake.
Hemorrhoid;38;This means eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Hemorrhoid;39;Most people do not have enough fiber in their diet.
Hemorrhoid;40;In such case, fiber supplements, such as psyllium or methylcellulose, can be of benefit.
Hemorrhoid;41;It is also important to increase fluids intake and maintain hydration.
Hemorrhoid;42;It is recommended to drink six to eight glasses of water a day to help keep stools soft.
Hemorrhoid;43;Home treatment may include sitz baths, topical creams, and suppositories.
Hemorrhoid;44;There are many types available for the treatment of hemorrhoids, but there is little evidence supporting their use.
Hemorrhoid;45;Small lifestyle modifications are important when dealing with hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;46;Not straining during defecation and going as soon as the urge appears are important measures.
Hemorrhoid;47;Staying active can help prevent constipation and reduce weight.
Hemorrhoid;48;Sometimes hemorrhoids can not be treated at home or the patient seeks help.
Hemorrhoid;49;Doctors can treat hemorrhoids with office procedures or in a hospital setting.
Hemorrhoid;50;Office treatments include:   Rubber band ligation - Rubber band ligation is a simple procedure.
Hemorrhoid;51;The doctor uses a special device to place a rubber band around the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;52;The band cuts off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;53;The hemorrhoid will then fall within a week.
Hemorrhoid;54;Scar tissue then forms to keep the remaining tissue fixated.
Hemorrhoid;55;This procedure is usually painless, because there are no nerve endings where the rubber band is placed.
Hemorrhoid;56;The patient should seek medical assistance if extreme pain is felt.
Hemorrhoid;57;This might be due to thrombosis.
Hemorrhoid;58;Sclerotherapy - the procedures involves an injection into the internal hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;59;The injection contains special solution which causes scar tissue to form and shrink the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;60;Infrared photocoagulation - In this procedure infrared light is applied at the internal hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;61;The infrared light causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;63;A special device is used to apply electric current onto the internal hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;64;The procedure causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid.
Hemorrhoid;65;In severe cases when home and office procedures fail, a surgical approach can be considered.
Hemorrhoid;66;There are several surgical techniques used.
Hemorrhoid;67;All of them are associated with different complications, such as bleeding, infection (sepsis), anal strictures, fecal incontinence, etc.
Hemorrhoid;68;Some of the procedures involve hemorrhoid removal.
Hemorrhoid;69;These procedures are commonly known as Hemorrhoidectomy.
Hemorrhoid;70;There are several variants, but in all of them, the surgeon will remove the hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;71;The procedure can be performed to remove external and large prolapsing internal hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;72;Hemorrhoidectomy is infamous for being very painfu.
Hemorrhoid;73;l This is due to specific location, where the procedure is performed.
Hemorrhoid;74;The anal canal contains many nerves, which can easily be traumatized.
Hemorrhoid;75;Other surgical procedures include - stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PPH, Longo's procedure) and doppler-guided artery ligation (DG-HAL/RAR or THD).
Hemorrhoid;76;Stapled hemorrhoidopexy involves a special device, called stapler, which lifts and fixates the prolapsed hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;77;The stapler will also excise mucosal tissue to block the blood flow to the remaining hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;78;However, stapling procedure is associated with a greater risk of recurrence.
Hemorrhoid;79;Doppler-guided ligation of hemorrhoidal arteries (DG-HAL/RAR or THD) has been recently purposed as a safe and relatively painless alternative to hemorrhoidectomy.
Hemorrhoid;80;A special ultrasound device is applied to identify the arteries that supply the hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoid;81;The surgeon will then will the ligate them, cutting the blood supply and preventing further problems.
Hemorrhoid;82;However, the procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate.
Hemorrhoid;83;Hemorrhoidolysis, a treatment for hemorrhoids
Glaucoma;1;Glaucoma is a disease that causes damage to the eye.
Glaucoma;2;If a person who has glaucoma does not get help from a doctor, they will not be able to see.
Glaucoma;3;This disease happens because of increased pressure in the eye.
Glaucoma;4;The pressure causes damage to the optic nerve.
Glaucoma;5;This can cause loss of vision, and may also be painful.
Glaucoma;6;Sometimes, it is hard for a person to know that they have glaucoma.
Glaucoma;7;The vision can be lost very slowly.
Glaucoma;8;When sight is lost from glaucoma, it cannot be recovered.
Glaucoma;9;There are two kinds of glaucoma, the kind that happens very fast, and the kind that happens slowly, over a long time.
Glaucoma;10;Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the world.
Glaucoma;11;There is often a hereditary tendency to glaucoma.
Glaucoma;12;A family history of glaucoma is a risk factor.
Glaucoma;13;"The relative risk of having what is called "" primary open-angle glaucoma "" (POAG) is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma."
Glaucoma;14;Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several different genes   Also, the likelihood of it happening is different in different populations.
Glaucoma;15;Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open angle glaucoma.
Brief psychotic disorder;1;Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms.
Brief psychotic disorder;2;This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for only an hour, but it can be any psychotic disorder, such as delusions or hallucinations.
Brief psychotic disorder;3;Doctors describe three types of BPD.
Brief psychotic disorder;4;The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress.
Brief psychotic disorder;5;The second type has no known cause.
Brief psychotic disorder;6;Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine, morphine or any type of drug.
Brief psychotic disorder;7;There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder.
Brief psychotic disorder;8;The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby.
Conduct disorder;1;Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder in which a person habitually, deliberately violates the rights of others.
Conduct disorder;2;They are typically aggressive and threaten to hit people.
Conduct disorder;3;"Habitual stealing is common; some people with CD are sex offenders."
Conduct disorder;4;They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people, and often enjoy doing so.
Conduct disorder;5;Many people with CD go on to develop antisocial personality disorder.
Conduct disorder;6;Everyone who has ASPD previously had CD.
Conduct disorder;7;The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them attention (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of importance.
Conduct disorder;8;Some risk factors are heredity, child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent.
Conduct disorder;9;Anti-psychotic therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic.
Conduct disorder;10;A high proportion of people who have CD also have other mental disorders, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes the affects of CD worse.
Skin cancer;1;Skin cancer is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin.
Skin cancer;2;In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too.
Skin cancer;3;These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably.
Skin cancer;4;Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis.
Skin cancer;5;Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage.
Skin cancer;6;Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring.
Skin cancer;7;Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive.
Skin cancer;8;Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer.
Skin cancer;9;Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.
Skin cancer;10;Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths.
Skin cancer;11;It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK.
Skin cancer;12;Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds.
Skin cancer;13;Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers.
Skin cancer;14;The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas.
Skin cancer;15;These are usually small spot growths caused by too much exposure to the sun over time.
Skin cancer;16;They do not usually spread, and rarely kill.
Skin cancer;17;Cancer   Description   Illustration   Basal-cell carcinoma   Note the pearly translucency to fleshy color, tiny blood vessels on the surface, and sometime ulceration which can be characteristics.
Skin cancer;18;The key term is translucency.
Skin cancer;19;Squamous-cell skin carcinoma   Commonly presents as a red, crusted, or scaly patch or bump.
Skin cancer;20;Often a very rapid growing tumor.
Skin cancer;21;Malignant melanoma   The common appearance is an asymmetrical area, with an irregular border, color variation, and often greater than 6 mm diameter.
Acute radiation syndrome;1;Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation.
Acute radiation syndrome;2;The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period.
Acute radiation syndrome;3;It is mainly damage to the blood, digestive system, and nervous system.
Botulism;1;Botulism is a rare disease caused by a bacteria called Clostridium botulinum.
Botulism;2;You can get it from eating meat that is not cooked properly.
Botulism;3;Babies can get it as well as adults.
Botulism;4;Symptoms include fever, vomiting, difficulty talking and weakness of the facial muscles.
Botulism;5;Botulism toxin is a major ingredient in botox, a gel that relaxes the facial muscles to make people look younger.
Botulism;6;Botulism is caused by a species of Clostridium, C. botulinum.
Botulism;7;It is transmitted through food containing endospores or through a wound.
Botulism;8;The most potent neurotoxin known is produced when the bacteria is exposed to low oxygen and body temperature.
Botulism;9;Foods which have been improperly canned are responsible for 90% of the cases of botulism.
Botulism;10;Natural, unpasteurized honey has been known to transmit infection and intoxication with the pathogen and the neurotoxin.
Botulism;11;"Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease causing a flaccid paralysis; the neurotoxin blocks neurotransmitters."
Botulism;12;This results in an inability to contract muscles.
Botulism;13;The neurotoxin has been used medically in the management of severe pain by anaesthetists and also cosmetically to reduce wrinkles.
Erysipeloid;1;Erysipeloid is a mild disease caused by the bacterium Erysipelothrix.
Erysipeloid;2;The only symptom is mild cellulitis.

Epidemic typhus;6;The signs of epidemic typhus include:   Chills   Cough   Fever   Pain in the joints   Pain in muscles   Eyes sensitive to light   Low blood pressure   Rash   Headache   Stupor
Paratyphoid fever;1;Paratyphoid fever, also known as enteric fever, is a waterborne disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Paratyphi.
Paratyphoid fever;2;It is related to Typhoid fever, but like Typhoid, it is unrelated to Typhus.
Paratyphoid fever;3;Symptoms include:   Fever,   Abdominal pain   Swelling of the liver or spleen   Slow heart rate.
Paratyphoid fever;4;The disease is rarely fatal and people usually recover in a few days, but some people can carry the bacteria for months.
Pemphigus;1;Pemphigus is an extremly rare skin disease.
Pemphigus;2;It happens because the antibodies attack the skin cells.
Pemphigus;3;It is an autoimmune disease.
Pemphigus;4;It causes blisters and sores on the skin.
Pemphigus;5;There are three types of pemphigus.
Pemphigus;6;Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type.
Pemphigus;7;It is more common in Ashkenazi Jews.
Nocardiosis;1;Nocardiosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Nocardia Asteroides.
Nocardiosis;2;It causes a dangerous form of pneumonia.
Nocardiosis;3;It affects the lungs, brain and skin.
Nocardiosis;4;It affects mainly people with a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV/AIDS, chronic lung disease, cancer or people who have had a transplant.
Brucellosis;1;Brucellosis is a disease that is caused by bacteria in the Brucella genus.
Brucellosis;2;It is also called Bang's disease, Crimean fever, Gibraltar fever, Malta fever, Maltese fever, Mediterranean fever, rock fever, and undulant fever.
Brucellosis;3;It is a very contagious disease (can be spread very easily from one person to another.)
Brucellosis;4;Brucellosis is a zoonosis, a disease that is spread from animals to humans.
Brucellosis;5;Humans get the disease by drinking milk that is unsterilized, or by eating meat from sick animals.
Brucellosis;6;Sometimes, but not very often, the disease can be spread from human to human.
Brucellosis;7;"The disease was first called "" Malta fever. """
Brucellosis;8;British doctors in the military first discovered it in Malta during the Crimean War (1850s).
Brucellosis;9;Dr. David Bruce was the first person to discover the bacteria that caused brucellosis.
Relapsing fever;1;Relapsing fever is an infection caused by some bacteria in the genus Borrelia.
Relapsing fever;2;It is sometimes called typhinia.
Relapsing fever;3;It is carried and spread by lice and ticks.
Relapsing fever;4;"The word "" relapse "" means to come back."
Relapsing fever;5;"The disease is called "" relapsing fever "" because the symptoms can go away and come back several times until the person is cured."
Murine typhus;1;Murine Typhus is a disease spread by fleas.
Murine typhus;2;It is also called endemic typhus.
Murine typhus;3;It is a type of typhus.

Zoonosis;1;Zoonosis or a zoonotic disease is an infectious disease which an animal can give to a human.
Zoonosis;2;These diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.
Zoonosis;3;Zoonotic diseases are very common.
Zoonosis;4;About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals.
Zoonosis;5;Zoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways.
Zoonosis;6;They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human - for example, through bites and infected saliva (like with rabies), or through the air.
Zoonosis;7;This is called direct zoonosis.
Zoonosis;8;Zoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector.
Zoonosis;9;This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected.
Zoonosis;10;Diseases like this are called vector-borne diseases.
Zoonosis;11;Sometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal.
Zoonosis;12;For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans.
Zoonosis;13;Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick.
Zoonosis;14;Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague.
Zoonosis;15;The rat is the host of the disease, and the flea is the vector.
Zoonosis;16;Many foodborne illnesses are zoonotic diseases.
Zoonosis;17;In these cases, a human gets sick from eating food that came from a sick animal.
Zoonosis;18;The most common pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses are Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria.
Zoonosis;19;Eggs, seafood, meat, poultry, and dairy products can all carry these bacteria and cause foodborne illnesses, like food poisoning, in humans.
Zoonosis;20;"Other zoonotic illnesses that humans can get from eating or drinking include:   Disease   Pathogen   Host   Spread By...   Brucellosis Brucella bacteria Cattle, goats, sheep, camels Having unpasteurized milk or cheese; Eating under-cooked meat."
Zoonosis;21;Cholera Vibrio cholerae bacteria Shellfish Eating under-cooked shellfish.
Zoonosis;22;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Prions Cattle Eating meat from cattle who had mad cow disease.
Zoonosis;23;"Listeriosis Listeria bacteria Cattle, fish Having unpasteurized milk or cheese; Eating under-cooked meat or seafood."
Zoonosis;24;Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii parasite Pigs, lambs, deer, cattle Eating under-cooked meat.
Zoonosis;25;Often, people can avoid foodborne illnesses by cooking meat, seafood, and eggs well enough to kill the bacteria or parasites in them.
Zoonosis;26;Below are some examples of zoonotic diseases that humans can get directly from sick, live animals.
Zoonosis;27;Disease   Pathogen   Host   Spread By...   Anthrax Bacillus anthracis bacteria Cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses, pigs Breathing in anthrax spores or getting them on the skin.

Hypersexuality;1;Hypersexuality is known as nymphomania when in females and satyriasis when in males.
Hypersexuality;2;It is a stronger than usual urge to have sexual intercourse.
Hypersexuality;3;Masturbation causes euphoria (extreme pleasure).
Hypersexuality;4;It is caused by some stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine.
Hypersexuality;5;It is also caused by some mental disorders: bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder.
Hypersexuality;6;Some cases are of unknown cause.
Hypersexuality;7;Some psychologists think it can be caused by a hormone imbalance.
Hypersexuality;8;Others believe it is caused by early exposure to pornography and sex.
Trichomoniasis;1;Trichomoniasis (often called trich) is a sexually transmitted disease.
Trichomoniasis;2;It is caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis, which is a protozoa made of just one cell.
Trichomoniasis;3;Trichomoniasis can affect both men and women.
Trichomoniasis;4;It is usually an infection of the urinary system and genitals.
Trichomoniasis;5;The Trichomonas vaginalis parasite can only live in the human genital tract.
Trichomoniasis;6;Trichomoniasis is only spread through sex, or if two people's genitals touch.
Trichomoniasis;7;Most people with trichomoniasis do not have any symptoms.
Trichomoniasis;8;When people do have symptoms, they usually start about 5 to 28 days after the person got infected.
Trichomoniasis;9;Symptoms may include:   Pain, burning, or itching in the urethra (urethritis), the vagina (vaginitis), or the penis   Pain while having sex (dyspareunia)   Women may have a yellow-green, badly-smelling vaginal discharge   Lower abdominal pain (this does not happen often)   Complications are serious problems that can happen because a person has a disease.
Trichomoniasis;10;These problems do not happen to everyone with trichomoniasis.
Trichomoniasis;11;They are the most serious problems that trichomoniasis can cause.
Trichomoniasis;12;Some of the most dangerous problems that can happen to a person with trichomoniasis include:   People with trichomoniasis are more likely to get (or spread) HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Trichomoniasis;13;If a woman is pregnant, trichomoniasis can cause her to have a premature infant, or an infant that weighs less than normal.
Trichomoniasis;14;Trichomoniasis may work together with human papillomavirus (HPV) to cause cervical cancer, although this has not been proven.
Trichomoniasis;15;In men, trichomoniasis can cause inflammation (swelling) of the urethra and the prostate.
Trichomoniasis;16;In the prostate, trichomoniasis may create chronic (long-term) inflammation that may eventually cause prostate cancer.
Trichomoniasis;17;Treatment for trichomoniasis is usually metronidazole (Flagyl), which kills protozoa like Trichomonas vaginalis.
Trichomoniasis;18;However, this medication has to be used carefully with woman who are in the early stages of pregnancy.
Trichomoniasis;19;Anyone the infected person has had sex with should also get treatment, even if they have no symptoms.
Trichomoniasis;20;About 95% to 97% of people with trichomoniasis are cured after one dose of metronidazole.
Trichomoniasis;21;Without treatment, trichomoniasis can stay in a woman's body for months to years.
Trichomoniasis;22;In many (but not all) men, it seems to go away on its own.
Trichomoniasis;23;Trichomoniasis can be prevented by having safe sex (for example, by using condoms).
Trichomoniasis;24;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that women who are having vaginal discharge should get tested for trichomoniasis.
Trichomoniasis;25;Trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world that is not caused by a virus.
Trichomoniasis;26;Every year, about 248 million more people get trichomoniasis.
Trichomoniasis;27;It is more common in women than men.
Trichomoniasis;28;It is also the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the United States.
Trichomoniasis;29;In the U.S., about 3.7 million people have trichomoniasis, and about 1.1 million more people get infected every year.
Trichomoniasis;30;Recent research has said that 3% of the U.S. population (3 in every 100 people) have trichomoniasis.
Trichomoniasis;31;In people who are at higher risk of getting trichomoniasis, like people with HIV and people in prison, between 7.5% to 32% are infected.

Schistosomiasis;3;It was previously called Bilharzia.
Schistosomiasis;4;Its intermediate host is freshwater snails.
Voyeurism;1;Voyeurism is when a person gets sexual pleasure from the fact that they can see other people doing things that are normally private, such as getting undressed, or being naked, or having sex.
Voyeurism;2;The people being watched are usually not aware of the voyeur (watcher).
Voyeurism;3;Voyerurism is an important concept in movie.

Hyponatremia;1;Hyponatremia (British English: hyponatraemia) is when a human body does not have enough salt (sodium) in its blood.
Hyponatremia;2;It is mostly caused by the presence of too much water.
Hyponatremia;3;Hyponatremia is most often a complication of other medical illnesses in which excess water collects in the body faster than can be excreted (for example in congestive heart failure, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), or polydipsia).
Hyponatremia;4;Some runners who drink a lot of water before running a marathon also suffer this illness.
Hyponatremia;5;Drinking too much water can impair the ability of marathon runners.
Delirium tremens;1;"Delirium tremens (often called DTs or "" the DTs "" ) is a medical emergency."
Delirium tremens;2;"It is the worst form of alcohol withdrawal, which can happen when a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking. """
Delirium tremens;3;"Delirium "" means very bad confusion that comes on quickly; "" tremens "" means "" shaking. """
Delirium tremens;4;Scientists think the DTs happen because the autonomic nervous system gets too excited.
Delirium tremens;5;It works too hard and will not shut off.
Delirium tremens;6;DTs were first written about in 1813.
Delirium tremens;7;Most people who stop drinking alcohol do not get the DTs.
Delirium tremens;8;But some people are more likely to get the DTs if they suddenly stop drinking.
Delirium tremens;9;DTs are more likely in people who:   Have had seizures when they tried to stop drinking alcohol before   Have drunk a lot of alcohol every day for several months   Have drunk alcohol for more than 10 years   Are sick or have other medical problems when they suddenly stop drinking   About 5% of people who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms get the DTs.
Delirium tremens;10;About 5-10% of chronic (long-term) alcoholics get the DTs at some point in their life.
Delirium tremens;11;DTs cause symptoms that can be very bad and very dangerous.
Delirium tremens;12;Even though not many people get DTs when they stop drinking, many people that do get DTs die from them.
Delirium tremens;13;Others get permanent brain damage or other problems.
Delirium tremens;14;Symptoms usually start within 2 to 3 days after the person had their last drink.
Delirium tremens;15;But in some people, DTs can happen up to a week or 10 days after their last drink.
Delirium tremens;16;"Most people who die from DTs die from one or more of these symptoms:   Very bad seizures, especially status epilepticus   Hyperthermia (a very high body temperature; if the body's temperature gets high enough, the brain will die)   Severe hypertension (very high blood pressure; if the blood pressure gets high enough, it can cause a stroke)   Severe tachycardia (very high heart rate; if the heart beats too fast, it cannot get blood and oxygen to the rest of the body."
Delirium tremens;17;Without enough blood and oxygen, no part of the body can survive.
Delirium tremens;18;Eventually breathing can stop.
Delirium tremens;19;The brain can die or be damaged.
Delirium tremens;20;The heart can stop beating normally or stop beating completely.)
Delirium tremens;21;Other body symptoms caused by DTs include:   Very bad sweating   Shaking or tremor  s (which may be uncontrollable)   Insomnia (being unable to sleep)   Feeling very restless   DTs can cause changes to thinking and feelings that can be very scary for the patient:   Very bad anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, or agitation (feeling very upset and unable to relax)   The person may be so anxious or upset that they are certain they are going to die   Being very confused (for example, the person might not recognize their family members)   Being disoriented (for example, the person may not know who he is, where he is, or what is happening)   Being unable to think normally or pay attention to anything   Being unable to talk normally   DTs can cause major changes to the senses, especially what a person sees, hears, and feels.
Delirium tremens;22;For example:   Visual hallucinations: seeing things that are not really there.
Delirium tremens;23;These things seem very real to the person with DTs.
Delirium tremens;24;For example, sometimes people with DTs see very scary visions of insects, snakes, or rats.
Delirium tremens;25;These visions often go along with the feeling that things like bugs are crawling on the person with DTs.
Delirium tremens;26;Auditory hallucinations: hearing things that are not really there.
Delirium tremens;27;DTs always need to be treated in a hospital.
Delirium tremens;28;If a person starts having symptoms of DTs at home, 9-1-1 (or their local emergency number) should be called for an ambulance right away.
Delirium tremens;29;Several types of medicines can be used to treat DTs:   Benzodiazepines are the most common type of medicine used for DTs.
Delirium tremens;30;In the United Kingdom, chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) are most often used.
Delirium tremens;31;In the United States, lorazepam (Ativan) and oxazepam are often used too.
Delirium tremens;32;These medicines will keep the person asleep or relaxed, make them more comfortable, and help prevent seizures.
Delirium tremens;33;Sometimes anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medicines are also used to prevent or treat seizures.
Delirium tremens;34;Antipsychotic medicines, like haloperidol (Haldol), may be used to help make hallucinations go away.
Delirium tremens;35;People with DTs are also often given thiamine (vitamin B1), an important vitamin, because alcoholics often do not have enough thiamine.
Delirium tremens;36;If thiamine levels are low enough, this can cause brain damage.
Alien hand syndrome;1;Alien Hand Syndrome (also known as anarchic hand, AHS or Doctor Strangeglove Syndrome) is a condition that seems to cause a person's hand to move on its own.
Tremor;1;In biology, a tremor is when antagonist muscles move repeatedly without being controlled.
Tremor;2;There are different forms of tremors.
Tremor;3;Very often, a tremor is a symptom for another condition, and not its cause.
Tremor;4;People with a tremor are not necessarily sick.
Tremor;5;"For example, physiological tremors are measurable, but not visible; they occur in all humans."
Diabetic ketoacidosis;1;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency that can happen in people with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;2;DKA happens mostly in people with Type 1 diabetes, although it may happen in some people that have Type 2 diabetes.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;3;DKA happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;4;All of the cells in the body need glucose (sugar) to survive, because the body needs sugar to make energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;5;Insulin breaks down glucose into a form that the body can use for energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;6;Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood and cannot get into the cells.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;7;This causes high blood sugar levels and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;8;DKA can be caused by not having enough insulin, eating too many carbohydrates, and sometimes physical or mental stress.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;9;DKA can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered, or is not being controlled well.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;10;DKA is diagnosed through blood and urine testing.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;11;These tests will show high blood sugar, which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;12;DKA was first discovered around 1886.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;13;Before insulin therapy was first used in the 1920s, DKA almost always caused death.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;14;"Symptoms of DKA include:   Nausea and vomiting   dehydration   The "" 3 polys "" of DKA:   Polydipsia (feeling very thirsty; this is caused by dehydration)   Polyphagia (feeling very hungry; the brain realizes the body's cells are not getting enough sugar and triggers hunger, because normally eating would give the cells the sugar they need)   Polyuria (urinating a lot; this is the body's way of trying to get rid of the extra glucose in the bloodstream)   A "" fruity "" smell on the breath (acetone breath, caused by the body trying to blow off the acids and waste products created by DKA)   Abdominal pain   As DKA gets worse, it can cause these symptoms:   Confusion, which becomes worse and worse (because the brain is not getting enough sugar to work properly)   Lethargy (feeling very tired), because the body is not able to make enough energy   Eventually, the person will go into a coma because the brain does not have enough sugar to stay awake   Kussmaul respirations (breathing that is deep, gasping, and difficult), because the body is trying to blow off extra acids   Without proper treatment, DKA can cause death."
Diabetic ketoacidosis;15;First, because there is not enough insulin to bring glucose into the cells, glucose builds up in the blood.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;16;This causes there to be too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;17;The cells start starving, because they do not have insulin to break down glucose into a form that the cells can use for energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;18;To try to create energy for the cells, the liver breaks down fat into fatty acids and ketones.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;19;These create a little bit of energy, but they are also acidic.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;20;The blood starts to get too acidic, and the body starts to get poisoned.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;21;Because the cells still do not have enough glucose to create the energy they need, the liver also breaks down glycogen to make more glucose.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;22;(The body stores sugar in different forms in case it needs energy later.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;23;Glucagon helps break down some of these sugar stores into glucose.)
Diabetic ketoacidosis;24;However, there is still not enough insulin in the blood to break down the glucose into energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;25;Because of this, the glucose stays in the blood (making the blood sugar levels get even higher) and the cells keep starving.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;26;Next, the body begins to break down protein.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;27;(When the body cannot create enough energy by breaking down fat and glycogen into sugar, it breaks down protein.)
Diabetic ketoacidosis;28;This causes the tissues in the body to lose nitrogen.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;29;Now there is much more glucose in the bloodstream than in the cells.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;30;The body always tries to stay in homeostasis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;31;In homeostasis, there would be an equal amount of sugar in the bloodstream and the cells.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;32;To try to make this happen, the cells (which have very little sugar in them) give up water to the blood (which is very sugary).
Diabetic ketoacidosis;33;The goal is to try to dilute the sugar in the blood, and decrease the high levels of hyperglycemia.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;34;If the cells give up too much water, they can get dehydrated (not have enough fluid left in them).
Diabetic ketoacidosis;35;Because DKA also causes a person to urinate often, a person with DKA can get dehydrated very quickly.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;36;This dehydration can be a medical emergency.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;37;The kidneys try to filter out the extra glucose in the bloodstream.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;38;This causes glucosuria (too much sugar in the urine).
Diabetic ketoacidosis;39;The extra glucose going through the kidneys causes more urine to be created.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;40;When a person urinates more, they lose more electrolytes, like sodium and potassium.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;41;Without enough electrolytes, the heart, muscles, and nerve cells cannot work properly.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;42;Also, eventually, the kidneys can fail because they are overworked by the amount of glucose they are trying to filter.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;43;People with DKA need to be treated in a hospital.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;44;Usually, treatment involves:   Giving insulin.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;45;Insulin reverses all of the changes in the body that cause DKA.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;46;It brings sugar out of the bloodstream and into the cells.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;47;Once the cells have enough insulin, they can break down glucose to get energy.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;48;Giving fluids.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;49;Because people with DKA can get so dehydrated, they are usually given fluids.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;50;Fluids may be given by mouth or through a needle placed in a vein.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;51;The extra fluid helps dilute all the sugar in the bloodstream.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;52;It also replaces the fluids that people with DKA lose by urinating so much.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;53;Giving electrolytes.
Diabetic ketoacidosis;54;"Not having enough insulin can lower the amount of electrolytes in the blood (see "" How Does DKA Happen? """
Diabetic ketoacidosis;56;To fix this, electrolytes can be given through a needle placed in a vein.
Sick building syndrome;1;Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a combination of illnesses (a syndrome) associated with a human's place of work (office building) or dwelling.
Sick building syndrome;2;A 1984 World Health Organization report into suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of SBS.
Sick building syndrome;3;Most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality.
Sick building syndrome;4;SBS can be caused by flaws in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Sick building syndrome;5;Other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), molds (see mold health issues), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (byproduct of some office machinery), using light industrial chemicals in the building, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value).
Sick building syndrome;6;People try to fix SBS symptoms by increasing the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange between the building's air and the outside air.
Sick building syndrome;7;But the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the SBS sources in the first place.
Sick building syndrome;8;Cleaners should lower their use of dangerous VOC cleaning compounds, and get rid of conditions that cause allergenic, potentially-deadly mold growth.
Sick building syndrome;9;"Building occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes, nose, throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; and odor and taste sensations."
Sick building syndrome;10;Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected.
Sick building syndrome;11;The key to discovery SBS is if a number of people first experience their illnesses within a period of weeks.
Sick building syndrome;12;In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone.
Sick building syndrome;13;However, there can be lasting effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building.
Sick building syndrome;14;Sensitive individuals can have long-term health effects.
Sick building syndrome;15;The following steps can avoid SBS:   Cleaning roof shingles for non-pressure removal of algae, mold & Gloeocapsa magma.
Sick building syndrome;16;Pollutant source removal or modification to storage of sources.
Sick building syndrome;17;Replacement of water-stained ceiling tiles and carpeting.
Sick building syndrome;18;Use paints, adhesives, solvents, and pesticides in well-ventilated areas, and use of these pollutant sources only during periods of non-occupancy.
Sick building syndrome;19;Increase the number of air exchanges, The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Engineers recommend a minimum of 8.4 air exchanges per 24 hour period.
Sick building syndrome;20;Proper and frequent maintenance of HVAC systems   Installing a UV-C light in the HVAC plenum   Regular vacuuming with a HEPA filter vacuum cleaner to collect and retain 99.97% of particles down to and including 0.3 micrometres.
Sick building syndrome;21;There might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men.
Sick building syndrome;22;Along with this, some studies found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema.
Sick building syndrome;23;Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors, because they have a tendency to have more clerical work where they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines), while men may more often have jobs based outside of offices.

Iodine deficiency;1;Iodine deficiency is when there is not enough iodine in the body.
Iodine deficiency;2;Iodine is an essential trace element.
Iodine deficiency;3;The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodotyronine have iodine.
Iodine deficiency;4;In areas where marine food is not eaten, there is low iodine in the diet.
Iodine deficiency;5;This causes iodine deficiency which gives rise to   goiter (so-called endemic goiter), as well as cretinism, which results in developmental delays and other health problems.
Iodine deficiency;6;"The Lancet has said, "" According to WHO, in 2007, nearly 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake, a third being of school age."
Iodine deficiency;8;"Thus iodine deficiency, as the single greatest preventable cause of mental retardation, is an important public-health problem. """
Iodine deficiency;9;Iodine deficiency causes diseases of the oral and salivary glands.
Iodine deficiency;10;In these areas,small amounts of iodine to table salt in form of sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and/or potassium iodate is added.
Iodine deficiency;11;This helps preventing iodine deficiency.
Iodine deficiency;12;This product is known as iodized salt.
Iodine deficiency;13;Iodine compounds have also been added to other foods.
Iodine deficiency;14;This includes flour, water and milk in areas of deficiency.
Iodine deficiency;15;Seafood is also a well known source of iodine.
Iodine deficiency;16;Thus, iodine deficiency is more common in mountainous regions of the world where food is grown in soil poor in iodine.
Iodine deficiency;17;International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders   Can Africa meet the goal of eliminating iodine-deficiency disorders by the year 2000?
Childhood obesity;1;Childhood obesity consists of excess body fat that adversely affects children's health and well being.
Childhood obesity;2;Obesity for children is especially dangerous because many overweight children will become overweight adults.
Childhood obesity;3;Health problems related to overweight kids include but are not limited to Type 2 diabetes in adolescence and young adulthood, heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure, diseases which until recently were not common in children and teenagers.
Abdominal obesity;1;Abdominal obesity, also called central body obesity, is a condition involving excess fat surrounding the abdomen and an increase in waist size in humans.
Abdominal obesity;2;Obesity in this area is linked to Type 2 Diabetes, insulin resistance and heart disease in humans of both genders.
Argyria;1;Argyria is a medical condition caused by the exposure to silver.
Argyria;2;"People with this condition may have a change in skin color to pale or "" greyish "" ."
Insulin resistance;1;Insulin resistance is a serious condition in which insulin becomes less able to lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood.
Insulin resistance;2;Usually, insulin helps sugar move out of the blood and into the body's cells.
Insulin resistance;3;In the cells, the body can use sugar to make energy.
Insulin resistance;4;If this does not happen correctly, too much sugar stays in the blood.
Insulin resistance;5;This is called hyperglycemia.
Insulin resistance;6;If the blood glucose level is above normal for a long time, this can lead to major health problems.
Insulin resistance;7;Insulin resistance often causes certain types of diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults.
Insulin resistance;8;A condition called 'metabolic syndrome' is strongly tied to insulin resistance.
Insulin resistance;9;High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia)   Fatigue, and sleepiness, especially after meals.
Insulin resistance;10;Brain fogginess and inability to focus (can't think clearly).
Insulin resistance;11;Weight gain, fat storage, difficulty losing weight.
Insulin resistance;12;High blood pressure (hypertension)   Increased thirst (called polydipsia) and hunger (called polyphagia)   Eat less carbohydrates, and very much less direct sugar.
Insulin resistance;13;Take more exercise, long walks, activity.
Insulin resistance;14;#Blood sugar level test after 12 hours starvation.
Metabolic syndrome;1;Metabolic syndrome is a combination of several medical issues.
Metabolic syndrome;2;They increase the risk for heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.
Metabolic syndrome;3;Twenty five percent of people of the United States have metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome;4;"The term "" metabolic syndrome "" dates back to at least the late 1950s, but came into common usage in the late 1970s to describe various associations of risk factors with diabetes mellitus that had been noted as early as the 1920s."
Metabolic syndrome;5;Related health matters include but aren't limited to:   Elevated cholesterol   Raised blood sugar   Insulin resistance   Reduced HDL cholesterol   Raised triglycerides   Central obesity   High blood pressure
Autoimmune disease;1;Autoimmune disease: when the body's immune system attacks its own body.
Autoimmune disease;2;The function of the immune system is to recognise and reject foreign bodies like bacteria.
Autoimmune disease;3;Sometimes the system goes wrong, and the body itself gets damaged by its immune system.
Autoimmune disease;4;Examples are:   Crohn's disease   Graves' disease   Type 1 diabetes   Multiple sclerosis   Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (also called juvenile idiopathic arthritis)   Celiac Disease   Myasthenia gravis

Stye;1;Styes (), also hordeolum () are infections at the base of a human eyelid or the eyelash.
Stye;2;"They are usually formed in the lids and are small red bumps; these styes can be either external or internal."
Stye;3;Styes are small-sized and rather short in duration.
Stye;4;They happen particularly often in infants, although people of all ages can get it.
Stye;5;They're triggered by eye rubbing or poor nutrition.
Stye;6;They often last four days under treatment to two weeks without.
Morquio syndrome;1;Morquio syndrome is a very rare inherited disease.
Morquio syndrome;2;It is called mucopolysaccharidosis because the body cannot break down mucopolysaccharides which make up mucous.
Morquio syndrome;3;It has very serious effects, but can be helped by a synthetic version of the enzyme which is not working.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;1;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), is a collection of diseases which make breathing gradually more difficult.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;2;Symptoms of COPD include difficulty breathing and cough, in particular coughing up lots of phlegm.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;3;It is usually caused by smoking cigarettes, and around half of people who smoke for their whole lives will develop COPD.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;4;Air pollution can be another cause, particularly in countries where indoor fires are used without ventilation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;5;At the beginning of the disease, the difficulty breathing is only noticeable when exercising, but over many years it gradually becomes worse, until there is difficulty breathing even when sitting or lying down.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;6;It can also lead to infections of the lung, which may be serious enough to cause death.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;7;The most important step in treating COPD is to stop smoking.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;8;Exercise and medications can also help.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;9;The most commonly used medications are called bronchodilators, which help to open up the airways and allow more air into the lungs.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;10;3% of all disability is related to COPD.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;11;People can die from COPD.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;12;The World Health Organization predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;13;It is thought that more people will die from it in the future because people are living longer and an increasing number of people in the world smoke.

Panic disorder;1;Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks.
Panic disorder;2;In addition, big changes in behavior might happen in at least one month, and the person might keep worrying about having other attacks.
Panic disorder;3;Panic disorder is a serious condition that can happen at any age.
Panic disorder;4;It can be treated with psychotherapy and antidepressants.
Generalized anxiety disorder;1;Generalized anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder which consists of excessive and irrational worry of everyday things.
Generalized anxiety disorder;2;This worry tends to interfere with normal daily functioning: people who have GAD anticipate disasters and they're always concerned about health matters, money, death, their own futures or family trouble.
Generalized anxiety disorder;3;Physical issues include though are not limited to trembling, numbness, muscle tension, sweating or hot flashes for at least six months.
Generalized anxiety disorder;4;Between six and eight million American adults have GAD.
Impetigo;1;Impetigo is a very contagious bacterial skin infection.
Impetigo;2;It is most common in pre-school children.
Impetigo;3;People who play close-contact sports like rugby and American football are also at risk.
Impetigo;4;Impetigo is not very common in adults.
Impetigo;5;Impetigo can also be called school sores.
Pain disorder;1;"Pain disorder is a condition where a patient experiences chronic pain in different places in the body; this pain seems to be caused by psychological stress."
Pain disorder;2;Treatment of the condition can be done with either therapy or drugs.
Folie à deux;1;This is about the mental disorder, the studio album is at Folie à Deux (album)   Folie à deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis.
Folie à deux;2;If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about folie à trois (3), folie à quatre (4), folie à plusieurs, or folie en famille.
Folie à deux;3;Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.
Folie à deux;4;Today, there are two main forms of the condition:   Folie imposée: A person forms a delusion, and passes it on to other people.
Folie à deux;5;If the people get separated, the delusions in those people who did not develop them first will usually disappear quickly.
Folie à deux;6;Folie simultanée: Two people suffering from delusions influence each other so that their delusions become very similar.
Folie à deux;7;Newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie à deux'.
Folie à deux;8;There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above.
Folie à deux;9;Also, in many cases, separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them.
Folie à deux;10;"Also, the person described as "" sane "" before developing the folie à deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness, or may develop one."
Folie à deux;11;The condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest-Charles Lasègue and Jules Farlet in 1877.
Folie à deux;12;Mass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie à deux.
Gigantism;1;Gigantism, also known as giantism, is a condition when growth and height are much above average.
Gigantism;2;Overactivity of growth hormone during childhood causes this condition in humans.

Psychopathy;1;Psychopathy is a personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder.
Psychopathy;2;Psychopaths are unemotional.
Psychopathy;3;They do not care about the emotions or rights of others.
Psychopathy;4;They show almost no empathy, and do not try to conform to social norms.
Psychopathy;5;They lack a conscience and do not feel guilt.
Psychopathy;6;A similar term is sociopathy.
Psychopathy;7;Many psychopaths are charming and often manage to have superficial ties with other people.
Psychopathy;8;They use other people for their own benefit.
Psychopathy;9;Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including sadism, violence and deception.
Psychopathy;10;They are very selfish and discard people whom they have no further use for.
Psychopathy;11;They tend to have many children by many partners.
Psychopathy;12;The definition of psychopathy has varied.
Psychopathy;13;Different definitions are used.
Psychopathy;14;They only partly overlap and sometimes seem contradictory.
Psychopathy;15;"There are efforts to use behaviour therapy to treat psychopaths; very often, this is done in prisons."
Psychopathy;16;Some people are mislabeled as psychopaths, but have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people.
Multiple sclerosis;1;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time.
Multiple sclerosis;2;In this disease, the body’s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system.
Multiple sclerosis;3;The disease has different effects in different people, and can make people’s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly.
Multiple sclerosis;4;People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.
Multiple sclerosis;5;In healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work.
Multiple sclerosis;6;Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire.
Multiple sclerosis;7;The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end.
Multiple sclerosis;8;A person with MS has myelin that is too thin or completely gone.
Multiple sclerosis;9;Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well.
Multiple sclerosis;10;Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.
Multiple sclerosis;11;Scientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS:   A person’s genetics (the qualities they are born with)   Too few vitamins in the body   Too much stress in a person’s life   Smoking cigars or cigarettes   Being ill many times as a child   Research about the causes of MS is still incomplete.
Multiple sclerosis;12;Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS.
Multiple sclerosis;13;Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease.
Multiple sclerosis;14;Quite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness.
Multiple sclerosis;15;The disease damages myelin.
Multiple sclerosis;16;Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin.
Multiple sclerosis;17;When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time.
Multiple sclerosis;18;This is called remission.
Multiple sclerosis;19;When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse.
Multiple sclerosis;20;The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS.
Multiple sclerosis;21;"In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called "" Primary Progressive MS "" ."
Multiple sclerosis;22;Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously.
Multiple sclerosis;23;People with MS have many problems.
Multiple sclerosis;24;Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing.
Multiple sclerosis;25;People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily.
Multiple sclerosis;26;Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor.
Multiple sclerosis;27;Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people.
Multiple sclerosis;28;Inside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment.
Multiple sclerosis;29;The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin.
Multiple sclerosis;30;The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells.
Multiple sclerosis;31;When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time.
Multiple sclerosis;32;Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has.
Multiple sclerosis;33;Inflammation is an important part of MS symptoms.
Multiple sclerosis;34;Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body.
Multiple sclerosis;35;It is the first part of an immune system response.
Multiple sclerosis;36;In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system.
Multiple sclerosis;37;Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae.
Multiple sclerosis;38;The people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too.
Multiple sclerosis;39;MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator.
Multiple sclerosis;40;Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself.
Multiple sclerosis;41;This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances.
Multiple sclerosis;42;To diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur.
Multiple sclerosis;43;The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis.
Multiple sclerosis;44;A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient.
Multiple sclerosis;45;A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin.
Multiple sclerosis;46;Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are.
Multiple sclerosis;47;Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons.
Multiple sclerosis;48;Once a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms.
Multiple sclerosis;49;Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely.
Multiple sclerosis;50;The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms.
Multiple sclerosis;51;Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over.
Multiple sclerosis;52;Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often.
Multiple sclerosis;53;These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead.
Multiple sclerosis;54;Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective.

Asbestosis;1;Asbestosis is a disease of the lungs caused by inhaling fibers of asbestos.
Asbestosis;2;It is not to be confused with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lungs which is also caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.
Asbestosis;3;Asbestosis has been the subject of many lawsuits, and many lawyers specialize in asbestosis and mesothelioma.
Asbestosis;4;Pneumoconiosis   Silicosis
Mesothelioma;1;Mesothelioma is a cancer of the mesothelial tissue, a membrane that surrounds several cavities inside of the human body, including the lungs .
Mesothelioma;2;Although mesothelioma has many possible causes, most cases can be traced to asbestos exposure.
Mesothelioma;3;Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer.
Mesothelioma;4;Most patients are diagnosed in their 60s and die at around age 70.
Mesothelioma;5;It is different from asbestosis, another disease caused by asbestos.
Mesothelioma;6;Mesothelioma has been the subject of many lawsuits.
Toxicity;1;Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism.
Toxicity;2;It is the subject-matter of toxicology.
Toxicity;3;A central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess.
Toxicity;4;Effects are dose-dependent: even water can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much.
Toxicity;5;For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect.
Toxicity;6;Toxicity is species-specific.
Toxicity;7;A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another.
Toxicity;8;Acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure, or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours).
Toxicity;9;To be known as acute toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something.
Toxicity;10;Acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity.
Toxicity;11;Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years).
Toxicity;12;It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research.
Toxicity;13;However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents).
Toxicity;14;Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, in vitro testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.
Bronchiolitis;1;Bronchiolitis is a medical condition where the smaller parts of the lung (called bronchioles) are irritated.
Bronchiolitis;2;This makes it very hard to move air in and out of the lungs.
Bronchiolitis;3;Many things can cause bronchiolitis.
Bronchiolitis;4;The most common is the respiratory syncytial virus.
Bronchiolitis;5;The disease Bronchiolitis is not the same as Bronchitis.
Bronchiolitis;6;The medicine used to treat bronchitis may not be the same as those used to treat bronchiolitis.
Bronchiolitis;7;The disease is more common in children.
Bronchiolitis;8;Usually treatment for bronchiolitis is to make the person as comfortable as possible.
Bronchiolitis;9;This can sometimes be giving them oxygen through tubes sitting on their nose (nasal cannula).
Bronchiolitis;10;A doctor may also use medicines such as epinephrine or dexamethasone.
Scarlet fever;1;Scarlet fever is an infectious disease that is caused by bacteria.
Scarlet fever;2;It is caused by exotoxin released by Streptococcus pyogenes.
Scarlet fever;3;It was once a major cause of death.
Scarlet fever;4;It is now treated with antibiotics.
Scarlet fever;5;The term scarlatina can be used to mean scarlet fever.
Scarlet fever;6;Scarlatina is a lesser form of scarlet fever.
Scarlet fever;7;At the early times, this disease could not be cured and this was a common reason for death in that time which applies to many famous people of the world.
Bone fracture;1;Bone fractures happen when a bone is damaged by stress.
Bone fracture;2;The bone can be fractured in many different ways.
Bone fracture;3;Most human bones are strong and do not break when hit by strong impacts or forces.
Bone fracture;4;However, if that force is too powerful, or there is something wrong with the bone, it can fracture.
Bone fracture;5;There are many different types of bone fractures.
Bone fracture;6;Fractures are often separated into categories.
Bone fracture;7;In an open fracture (also called a compound fracture), the broken bone breaks through the skin.
Bone fracture;8;This can cause infection, since the skin usually protects the body from germs.
Bone fracture;9;If the skin is broken, germs can get into the body.
Bone fracture;10;Open fractures can also damage muscles, tendons and ligaments if the sharp ends of the broken bone go through them.
Bone fracture;11;In a closed fracture, the broken bone does not break through the skin.
Bone fracture;12;In a simple fracture, the broken bone is the only thing that is damaged.
Bone fracture;13;In a complex fracture, the sharp ends of the broken bone damage the soft tissue around the bone.
Bone fracture;14;This is the type of injury in which the broken bone has passed through the skin, forming some wounds.
Bone fracture;15;That is why it is also called an open fracture or composite fracture.
Bone fracture;16;Compared to the simple fracture , the open wound has made it even more dangerous since the person suffering from it is exposed to infection.
Bone fracture;17;Therefore, an operation may be necessary to prevent the wound from becoming infected.
Bone fracture;18;In a complete fracture, the bone is broken all the way through.
Bone fracture;19;The broken bone is in two separate pieces.
Bone fracture;20;In an incomplete fracture, the bone is not broken all the way through.
Bone fracture;21;The bone is partly broken, but it is still in one piece.
Bone fracture;22;There are a few kinds of incomplete fractures, including:   Hairline fracture: Only the outer layer of the bone is broken.
Bone fracture;23;This is also called a fissure fracture.
Bone fracture;24;Greenstick fracture: These fractures usually happen only in children, because their bones are more flexible than adults'.
Bone fracture;25;In a greenstick fracture, only one side of the bone is broken.
Bone fracture;26;"The bone is usually "" bent, "" and is broken only on the outside of the bend."
Bone fracture;27;In a comminuted fracture, at least three pieces of a bone have broken off.
Bone fracture;28;This means the bone is in four separate pieces or more (the main bone, plus the three or more pieces that have broken off).
Bone fracture;29;Sometimes people have multiple fractures.
Bone fracture;30;"This can mean two different things:   One bone is broken in two different places, or more; or   One person has fractures in many different bones, all caused by the same injury (like being hit by a car)."
Bone fracture;31;On average, it usually takes 6-8 weeks for a fracture to heal.
Bone fracture;33;However, healing times depend on many different things, like which bones were broken, how bad the breaks were, age (younger people usually heal faster), and nutrition.
Bone fracture;34;Most fractures are diagnosed by using an X-ray.
Bone fracture;35;If the X-ray cannot see the fracture, other scans, like MRIs and CT scans, can show that a fracture exists.
Bone fracture;36;"The best way to "" fix "" a bone fracture is to make sure the ends of the broken bone are lined up and tight together."
Bone fracture;37;As the American Academy on Orthopedic Surgeons says:      To help decrease pain from the fracture, doctors can prescribe medications or suggest over-the-counter painkillers.
Bone fracture;38;"Scientists have come up with a few ways to "" regenerate bone "" (make the bone grow again)."
Bone fracture;39;Their many ideas for future strategies include doing gene therapy and using 3-D printers.

Cyclopia;1;Cyclopia (also called cyclocephaly or synophthalmia) is a birth defect.
Cyclopia;2;Cyclopia is characterized by a failure of the prosencephalon to separate the two orbits (eyes).
Cyclopia;3;This leads to the formation of a central deformed eye and an absence of a nasal cavity.
Cyclopia;4;It causes can be either genetic, or as a result of an exposure to poisons.
Cyclopia;5;"The term "" cyclopia "" comes from Cyclops, a giant one-eyed creature the Greek Greek mythology."
Adrenoleukodystrophy;1;Adrenoleukodystrophy is a disease that is linked on the X chromosome.
Adrenoleukodystrophy;2;It is a result of fatty acid digestive enzymes not breaking up the fats.
Adrenoleukodystrophy;3;These fats build up in the brain.
Adrenoleukodystrophy;4;They damage the myelin that surrounds nerves.
Adrenoleukodystrophy;5;This can cause seizures and hyperactivity.
Adrenoleukodystrophy;6;It can also cause problems with speaking, listening and understanding verbal instructions.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;1;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical problem involving the part of the body which runs from the mouth to the stomach.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;2;The problem exists when stomach contents move backwards towards the mouth.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;3;Food or liquid moves from the stomach into the tube between the mouth and the stomach.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;4;That tube is called the oesophagus.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;5;"The burning sensation is commonly called "" heartburn, "" but it has nothing to do with the heart."
Gastroesophageal reflux disease;6;MedicineNet, GERD   National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC), GERD   MedlinePlus, GERD
Catatonia;1;Catatonia means a person is awake, but does not move, talk, or react to anything but pain.
Catatonia;2;The person can stay stiff and still for hours.
Catatonia;3;A person with catatonia may look to be in a stupor (being mentally numb and in a daze).
Catatonia;4;"The cause is in the nervous system; the brain and nerves."
Catatonia;5;This problem was first written about in 1874 in Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein.
Catatonia;6;Catatonia can sometimes happen with mental disorders.
Catatonia;7;It can be a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.
Catatonia;8;Catatonia may also happen when a person abuses drugs or overdoses by taking too much of a drug.
Catatonia;9;Catatonia can also be caused by many different medical disorders.
Catatonia;10;"Some causes are infections, such as encephalitis; autoimmune diseases; damage to the brain from strokes; and metabolic problems."
Catatonia;11;A person can also get catatonia from benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which happens if the person quickly stops taking benzodiazepine medications.
Catatonia;13;Doctors can treat catatonia.
Catatonia;14;They usually start with medicines such as benzodiazepines.
Catatonia;15;"If those medicines do not work; doctors may use shock therapy."
Catatonia;16;Antipsychotic medicines can also be used, but with safety in mind.
Catatonia;17;Sometimes they can make catatonia worse or have bad side effects.
Catatonia;18;A group of anesthetic drugs called NMDA antagonists may be helpful when benzodiazepines don't work.

Streptococcal pharyngitis;1;Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is an illness that is caused by the bacteria called “Group A Streptococcus”.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;2;Strep throat affects the throat and the tonsils.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;3;The tonsils are the two glands in the throat at the back of the mouth.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;4;Strep throat can also affect the voice box (larynx).
Streptococcal pharyngitis;5;Common symptoms include fever, throat pain (also called a sore throat), and swollen glands (called lymph nodes) in the neck.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;6;Strep throat causes 37% of sore throats among children.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;7;Strep throat spreads through close contact with a sick person.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;8;To be sure that a person has strep throat, a test called a throat culture is needed.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;9;Even without this test, a likely case of strep throat can be known because of the symptoms.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;10;Antibiotics can help a person with strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;11;Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;12;They are used mostly to prevent complication such as rheumatic fever rather than to shorten the length of sickness.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;13;The usual symptoms of strep throat are a sore throat, fever of more than 38 °C (100.4 °F), pus (a yellow or green fluid made up of dead bacteria, and white blood cells) on the tonsils, and swollen lymph nodes.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;14;There can be other symptoms such as:   Head pain (headache)   Vomiting or the urge to vomit (nausea)   Stomach pain   Flatulence   Muscle pain   Rash (small red bumps) on the body or in the mouth or throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;15;This is an unusual but a specific sign.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;16;A person who gets strep throat will show symptoms one to three days after coming in contact with a sick person.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;17;Strep throat is caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS).
Streptococcal pharyngitis;18;Other bacteria or viruses can also cause a sore throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;19;People get strep throat by direct, close contact with a sick person.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;20;The illness can spread more easily when people are crowded together.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;21;Examples of crowding include people in the military or in schools.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;22;The GAS bacteria can dry out into dust, but then it cannot make people sick.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;23;If bacteria in the environment are keep moist they can make people sick for up to 15 days.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;24;Moist bacteria can be found on things like toothbrushes.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;25;These bacteria can live in food, but this is very unusual.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;26;People who eat the food can become sick.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;27;Twelve percent of children with no symptoms of strep throat have GAS in their throats normally.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;28;+ Modified Centor score   PointsProbability of StrepTreatment   1 or less <10%No antibiotic or culture needed   2 11–17%Antibiotic based on culture or RADT   3 28–35%   4 or 5 52%Antibiotics without doing a culture   A checklist called the modified Centor score helps doctors decide how to care for people with sore throats.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;29;The Centor score has five clinical measurements or observations.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;30;It shows how likely it is that someone has strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;31;One point is given for each of these criteria:   No cough   Swollen lymph nodes or lymph nodes that hurt if they are touched   Temperature greater than 38 °C (100.4 °F)   Pus or swelling of the tonsils   Under the age of 15 years (a point is taken away if the person is older than 44 years)   A test called a throat culture is the main way to know if a person has strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;32;This test is correct 90 to 95 percent of the time.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;33;There is another test called a rapid strep test, or RADT.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;34;The rapid strep test is faster than a throat culture but correctly finds the illness only 70 percent of the time.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;35;Both tests can show when a person does not have strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;36;They can show this correctly 98 percent of the time.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;37;When a person is sick a throat culture or rapid strep test can tell if the person is sick from strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;38;People who have no symptoms should not be tested with a throat culture or rapid strep test as some people have streptococcal bacteria in their throats normally without any bad results.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;39;And these people do not need treatment.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;40;Strep throat has some of the same symptoms as other illnesses.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;41;Because of this, it can be hard to know if a person has strep throat without a throat culture or rapid strep test.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;42;If the person has fever and sore throat with coughing, a runny nose, diarrhea, and red itchy feeling eyes, it is more likely to be a sore throat that is caused by a virus.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;43;Infectious mononucleosis can cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck and a sore throat, fever, and it can make the tonsils get bigger.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;44;This diagnosis can be determined by a blood test.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;45;There is however no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;46;Some people get strep throat more often than others.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;47;Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;48;Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;49;Waiting is also appropriate.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;50;Strep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;51;Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;52;The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;53;For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;54;Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;55;Medicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;56;These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;57;Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;58;Aspirin may be used in adults.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;59;It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;60;Penicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;61;It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;62;Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;63;In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;64;Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;65;The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;66;The average length is three to five days.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;67;Antibiotics lowers this by about one day.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;68;These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;69;The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;70;These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;71;The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;72;Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;73;Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;74;The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;75;Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;76;Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis).
Streptococcal pharyngitis;77;Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;78;The symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;79;Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;80;They also make it harder to spread the illness.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;81;Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;82;These very bad problems might be caused by strep throat:   These include rheumatic fever or scarlet fever   A deadly illness called toxic shock syndrome   Glomerulonephritis   An illness called PANDAS syndrome.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;83;This is an immune problem that causes sudden, sometimes serious behavioral problems.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;84;Strep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;85;About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;86;Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;87;The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;88;It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults.
Streptococcal pharyngitis;89;Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring.
Urinary tract infection;1;A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection caused by bacteria in part of the urinary tract.
Urinary tract infection;2;In the lower urinary tract, it is known as a simple cystitis (a bladder infection).
Urinary tract infection;3;In the upper urinary tract, it is known as pyelonephritis (a kidney infection).
Urinary tract infection;4;Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include painful peeing and either frequent peeing or wanting to pee (or both).
Urinary tract infection;5;Symptoms of a kidney infection also include fever and side and back pain.
Urinary tract infection;6;In old people and young children, the symptoms are not always as clear.
Urinary tract infection;7;The main cause for both types is the bacteria Escherichia coli.
Urinary tract infection;8;Other bacteria, viruses, or fungus may be the cause in rare cases.
Urinary tract infection;9;Women get urinary tract infections more often than men.
Urinary tract infection;10;Half of women have an infection at some point in their lives.
Urinary tract infection;11;It is common to have repeated infections.
Urinary tract infection;12;Risk factors include sexual intercourse as well as family history.
Urinary tract infection;13;Sometimes a person who had a bladder infection will get a kidney infection.
Urinary tract infection;14;Kidney infection also can be caused by bacteria in the blood.
Urinary tract infection;15;Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone.
Urinary tract infection;16;Sometimes, the urine needs to be tested.
Urinary tract infection;17;A person with frequent infections can take low-dose antibiotics to prevent future infections.
Urinary tract infection;18;Antibiotics are used to treat simple cases of urinary tract infections.
Urinary tract infection;19;resistance to many of the antibiotics used to treat this condition, however, is increasing.
Urinary tract infection;20;People who have complicated urinary tract infections sometimes have to take antibiotics for a longer time, or might take antibiotics intravenously (through the veins).
Urinary tract infection;21;If symptoms have not improved in two or three days, a person will need further tests.
Urinary tract infection;22;In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection.
Urinary tract infection;23;Ten percent of women develop urinary tract infections yearly.
Urinary tract infection;24;Lower urinary tract infection is also known as a bladder infection.
Urinary tract infection;25;The most common symptoms are burning with peeing and having to pee frequently (or wanting to pee) without vaginal discharge or significant pain.
Urinary tract infection;26;These symptoms can vary from mild to severe.
Urinary tract infection;27;In healthy women, the symptoms last an average of six days.
Urinary tract infection;28;Some people will have pain above the pubic bone (lower abdomen) or in the lower back.
Urinary tract infection;29;People who have an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis (a kidney infection), can have flank pain, fever (a high temperature), or nausea and vomiting.
Urinary tract infection;30;Those symptoms are in addition to the normal symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.
Urinary tract infection;31;In rare cases the urine looks bloody or contains visible pyuria (pus in the urine).
Urinary tract infection;32;In young children, fever can be the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
Urinary tract infection;33;Many medical associations recommend a urine culture for females younger than two year old or uncircumcised males who are younger than a year and have a fever.
Urinary tract infection;34;Infants with UTI sometimes eat poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of jaundice ( a yellow coloring of the skin).
Urinary tract infection;35;Older children can have new urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control).
Urinary tract infection;36;Urinary tract symptoms are frequently not seen in those who are old.
Urinary tract infection;37;Sometimes, the only symptoms are incontinence (loss of bladder control), a change in mental status (ability to think), or feeling tired.
Urinary tract infection;38;The first symptom for some old people is sepsis, an infection of the blood.
Urinary tract infection;39;Diagnosis can be difficult because many old people are incontinent (cannot hold their pee) or have dementia (poor thinking abilities).
Urinary tract infection;40;E. coli is the cause of 80–85% of urinary tract infections.
Urinary tract infection;41;Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the cause in 5–10% of cases.
Urinary tract infection;42;In rare cases, viral or fungal infections cause urinary tract infections Other bacterial causes of UTI include:   Klebsiella   Proteus   Pseudomonas,   Enterobacter   These bacterial causes are not common and usually happen when the person has an abnormal urinary system or the person has a urinary catheterization (tube inserted into the bladder.
Urinary tract infection;43;Urinary tract infections due toStaphylococcus aureus usually happens after the person has had a blood infection.
Urinary tract infection;44;Sexual intercourse is the cause of 75–90% of bladder infections in young, sexually active women.
Urinary tract infection;45;The risk of infection is related to how often they have sex.
Urinary tract infection;46;"With UTIs so frequent when women first get married, the term "" honeymoon cystitis "" is often used."
Urinary tract infection;47;In post-menopausal women (women who have stopped menstruating), sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI.
Urinary tract infection;48;Using spermicide (a gel or cream to kill sperm) increases the risk of UTIs.
Urinary tract infection;49;Women get more UTIs than men because women have a urethra that is much shorter and closer to the anus.
Urinary tract infection;50;As a woman's estrogen (a hormone) levels decrease with menopause, the risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora (good bacterial that live in the vagina).
Urinary tract infection;51;A urinary catheter is a tube that is put into the bladder to drain the urine.
Urinary tract infection;52;Using a catheter increases the risk for urinary tract infections.
Urinary tract infection;53;The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is 3% - 6% every day the catheter is used.
Urinary tract infection;54;Antibiotics do not stop these infections.
Urinary tract infection;55;The risk of an infection can be decreased by:   using a catheter only when necessary   making sure everything is very clean (sterile) when putting the catheter in   making sure that nothing blocks the catheter.
Urinary tract infection;56;Bladder infections are more common in some families.
Urinary tract infection;57;Other risk factors include diabetes, being circumcised, and having a large prostate (a gland around the urethra in males).
Urinary tract infection;58;Complicating factors are not completely clear.
Urinary tract infection;59;These factors may include some anatomic problems (relating to physical narrowing), functional, or metabolic problems.
Urinary tract infection;60;A complicated UTI is more difficult to treat and usually needs more aggressive evaluation, treatment, and follow-up.
Urinary tract infection;61;In children, UTIs are linked to vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.
Urinary tract infection;62;The bacteria that cause urinary tract infections usually go into the bladder from the uretha.
Urinary tract infection;63;It is believed these bacteria come from the bowel.
Urinary tract infection;64;Females are at greater risk because they have a short urethra that is close to their anus).
Urinary tract infection;65;After entering the bladder, E. Coli are able to stick to the bladder wall.
Urinary tract infection;66;They form a biofilm, which is a coating of microorganisms, that resists the body's immune response.
Urinary tract infection;67;However, infections can also come through the blood or lymph.
Urinary tract infection;68;The following activities do not cause a UTI or make them happen less frequently:   using birth-control pills or condoms   peeing immediately after sex   the type of underwear worn   personal cleaning methods used after peeing or defecating   whether a person usually bathes or showers.
Urinary tract infection;69;holding onto urine and not peeing   tampon use   douching   People who often get UTIs and who use spermicide or a diaphragm for birth control should use a different type of birth control.
Urinary tract infection;70;Cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of infections, but some people cannot use cranberries for long periods of time.
Urinary tract infection;71;Gastrointestinal (stomach) upset occurs in more than 30% of people who regularly drink cranberry juice or take capsules.
Urinary tract infection;72;As of 2011, probiotics used intravaginally (in the vagina) require further study to determine if they are helpful.
Urinary tract infection;73;For people who keep getting infections, taking antibiotics for a long time is helpful.
Urinary tract infection;74;Drugs frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
Urinary tract infection;75;If infections are related to sexual intercourse, some women find it useful to taking antibiotics after sex.
Urinary tract infection;76;In post-menopausal women, using topical vaginal estrogen (a hormone applied to the skin of the vaginal) has been found to reduce getting a UTI.
Urinary tract infection;77;Unlike topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries (medical devices put in the vagina is not as useful as low-dose antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection;78;A number of vaccines are being developed (as of 2011).
Urinary tract infection;79;There is little evidence that using preventative antibiotics decreases urinary tract infections in children.
Urinary tract infection;80;It is rare for people who have no problems with their kidneys to develop kidney problems from frequent UTIs.
Urinary tract infection;81;Having frequent urinary tract infections as a child causes less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.
Urinary tract infection;82;In most cases, UTIs can be diagnosed just from the symptoms and there is no need for laboratory testing.
Urinary tract infection;83;Urinalysis (testing the urine) can be used to confirm the diagnosis in complicated cases.
Urinary tract infection;84;The urine is tested for urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.
Urinary tract infection;85;Another test, urine microscopy, looks for red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria.
Urinary tract infection;86;Urine culture is considered positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10  colony-forming units per mL of a typical bacteria that causes infections of the urinary tract.
Urinary tract infection;87;Cultures can also be used to test which antibiotic will work.
Urinary tract infection;88;However, women with negative cultures can still improve with antibiotic treatment.
Urinary tract infection;89;UTI symptoms in old people can be vague, and diagnosis can be difficult as there is no really reliable test.
Urinary tract infection;90;A urinary tract infection in the lower urinary tract is known as a bladder infection.
Urinary tract infection;91;A UTI in the upper urinary tract is known as pyelonephritis or kidney infection.
Urinary tract infection;92;If the urine has significant bacteria, but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Urinary tract infection;93;A urinary tract infection is said to be complicated if:   it is in the upper tract   the person has diabetes mellitus   the person is pregnant   the person is male   the person has a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) because of another illness.
Urinary tract infection;94;Otherwise if a women is a healthy and before menopause, the infection is said to be uncomplicated.
Urinary tract infection;95;When children also have a fever, the urinary tract infection is considered to be an upper urinary tract infection.
Urinary tract infection;96;To diagnose a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required.
Urinary tract infection;97;"Contamination poses a frequent challenge so a cutoff of 10  CFU/mL is used for a "" clean-catch "" mid-stream sample, 10  CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10  CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder through the stomach wall with a needle)."
Urinary tract infection;98;The World Health Organization does not like the use of “urine bags” to collect samples because there is a high rate of contamination when that urine is cultured.
Urinary tract infection;99;Catheterization is preferred if an individual is unable to use a toilet.
Urinary tract infection;100;Some medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time X-rays while they urinate) in all children who are younger than 2 years old and have had a urinary tract infection.
Urinary tract infection;101;Other medical groups such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend routine imaging only in babies younger than 6 months old or who have unusual findings.
Urinary tract infection;102;In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause.
Urinary tract infection;103;Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection.
Urinary tract infection;104;Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) can be the cause for people who have UTI symptoms many times, but whose urine cultures remain negative and do not improved with antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection;105;Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Urinary tract infection;106;Phenazopyridine can be used in addition to antibiotics to help ease the burning pain of a bladder infection.
Urinary tract infection;107;However, phenazopyridine is no longer commonly recommended due to safety concerns.
Urinary tract infection;108;It can cause methemoglobinemia, which means there is higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood.
Urinary tract infection;109;Acetaminophen can be used for fevers.
Urinary tract infection;110;"Women who keep getting simple UTIs can benefit from self-treatment; these women should get medical treatment medical only if the initial treatment fails."
Urinary tract infection;111;Health care providers may also prescribe the antibiotics by phone.
Urinary tract infection;112;Simple infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone.
Urinary tract infection;113;Oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, or a fluoroquinolone will shorten the time to recovery.
Urinary tract infection;114;All these drugs are equally effective.
Urinary tract infection;115;A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually enough.
Urinary tract infection;116;Nitrofurantoin needs 5–7 days.
Urinary tract infection;117;With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36 hours.
Urinary tract infection;118;About 50% of people will get better without treatment within a few days or weeks.
Urinary tract infection;119;The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend fluoroquinolones as first treatment because of concerns that overuse will lead to resistance to this class of drugs, making these drugs less effective for more serious infections.
Urinary tract infection;120;Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these drugs because to their widespread use.
Urinary tract infection;121;In some countries, trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX.
Urinary tract infection;122;Children with simple UTIs are often helped by a three-day course of antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection;123;Pyelonephritis (kidney infection) is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection;124;Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in geographic areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%.
Urinary tract infection;125;If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone often is prescribed.
Urinary tract infection;126;People with more severe symptoms are sometimes admitted a hospital for ongoing antibiotics.
Urinary tract infection;127;If symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment, it can mean that the urinary tract is blocked by a kidney stone.
Urinary tract infection;128;Urinary tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women.
Urinary tract infection;129;They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 years.
Urinary tract infection;130;"Ten percent of women get an infection yearly; 60% have an infection at some point in their lives."
Urinary tract infection;131;Nearly half of people get a second infection within a year.
Urinary tract infection;132;Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males.
Urinary tract infection;133;Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) occurs between 20–30 times less frequently than bladder infections.
Urinary tract infection;134;Pyelonephritis is the most common cause of hospital acquired infections, accounting for approximately 40% of hospital-acquired infections.
Urinary tract infection;135;Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from 2% to 7% in women of childbearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes.
Urinary tract infection;136;Rates of aysmtomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are 7-10%.
Urinary tract infection;137;Urinary tract infections can affect 10% of people during childhood.
Urinary tract infection;138;Urinary tract infections in children are the most common in uncircumcised males younger than 3 months of age, followed by females younger than one year.
Urinary tract infection;139;Estimates of frequency among children, however, vary widely.
Urinary tract infection;140;In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and 2 years, 2- 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.
Urinary tract infection;141;In the United States, urinary tract infections lead to nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and 100,000 hospitalizations every year.
Urinary tract infection;142;The cost of these infections is high due to both lost time at work and costs of medical care.
Urinary tract infection;143;The direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6 billion USD yearly in the United States.
Urinary tract infection;144;Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times.
Urinary tract infection;145;The first written description, found in the Ebers Papyrus, dates to around the 1550 BC.
Urinary tract infection;146;"The Egyptians described a urinary tract infection as "" sending forth heat from the bladder. """
Urinary tract infection;147;Herbs, bloodletting, and rest were the common treatments until the 1930s, when antibiotics became available.
Urinary tract infection;148;Pregnant women with UTIs have a higher risk of kidney infections.
Urinary tract infection;149;During pregnancy, high progesterone (a hormone) levels decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder.
Urinary tract infection;150;Decreased muscle tone leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and toward the kidneys.
Urinary tract infection;151;If bacteria are present, pregnant women have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection.
Urinary tract infection;152;Thus treatment is recommended if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms.
Urinary tract infection;153;Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because those medications are generally considered safe in pregnancy.
Urinary tract infection;154;A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, or seizures).
Pus;1;Pus is a fluid that is created as a result of certain inflammations in vertebrates.
Pus;2;In vertebrates, white blood cells fight the inflammation.
Pus;3;Neutrophils destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example bacteria, macrophages engulf and neutralise these agents.
Pus;4;Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly.
Pus;5;In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as psoriasis.
Microtia;1;Microtia meaning 'small ear' is a deformation of the outer ear.
Microtia;2;Over 90% of the time, only one ear is affected, but both ears can be affected.
Microtia;3;More boys are affected than girls.
Microtia;4;The right ear is more affected than the left.
Microtia;5;One in 1000 people have microtia.
Microtia;6;It can affect hearing.
Microtia;7;"There are four grades of microtia:   Grade I: A slightly small ear with identifiable structures and a small but present external ear canal   Grade II: A partial or hemi-ear with a closed off ( "" stenotic "" ) external ear canal producing a conductive hearing loss   Grade III: Absence of the external ear with a small peanut vestige structure and an absence of the external ear canal and ear drum   Grade IV: Absence of the total ear { "" anotia "" )   Grade III is most common, and can be corrected by surgery."
Nocturnal enuresis;1;Nocturnal enuresis, also called bedwetting, is a health issue that is often caused by or the symptom of certain health troubles.
Nocturnal enuresis;2;It happens when a person involuntarily urinates while she is asleep.
Atypical depression;1;Atypical depression is a subtype of major depression and dysthymia, sharing certain symptoms for both, though it is also marked with mood reactivity (having improved moods during positive events).
Atypical depression;2;Atypical depression is also associated with too much sleeping and excessive eating.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;1;Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a chronic (long-term) infection of the lymphatic system caused by three different types of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;2;The bacteria spread through sexual contact.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;3;The infection is not caused by the same bacteria that cause genital chlamydia.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;4;LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;5;Every year, a few hundred cases of LGV are diagnosed in the United States.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;6;However, the actual number of infections is unknown.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;7;LGV is more common in men than women.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;8;The main risk factor is being HIV-positive.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;9;Symptoms of LGV can begin a few days to a month after coming in contact with the bacteria.
Lymphogranuloma venereum;10;"Symptoms include:   Blood or pus from the rectum (blood in the stools)   Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin   Painful bowel movements (tenesmus)   Small painless sore on the male genitals or in the female genital tract   Swelling and redness of the skin in the groin area   Swelling of the labia   Swollen groin lymph nodes on one or both sides; it may also affect lymph nodes around the rectum in people who have anal intercourse   Diarrhea and lower abdominal pain."
Bleeding;1;Bleeding, technically known as haemorrhaging (Brit.)
Bleeding;2;or hemorrhaging (US) is the loss of blood or blood escape from the circulatory system.
Bleeding;3;Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from blood vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the vagina, mouth, nose, ear or anus, or through a break in the skin.
Bleeding;4;Desanguination is a major blood loss.
Bleeding;5;Exsanguination is losing enough blood to cause death.
Bleeding;6;A person does not have to lose all of their blood to die.
Bleeding;7;People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood.
Bleeding;8;Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10–15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties, and blood donation typically takes 8–10% of the donor's blood volume.
Nightmare disorder;1;"Nightmare disorder, also known as "" dream anxiety disorder "" , is a sleep disorder characterized by frequent nightmares."
Nightmare disorder;2;The nightmares, which often portray the individual in a situation that jeopardizes their life or personal safety, usually occur during the second half of the sleeping process, called the REM stage.
Nightmare disorder;3;Though such nightmares occur within many people, those with nightmare disorder experience them with a greater frequency.
Nightmare disorder;4;The disorder's DSM-IV number is 307.47.
Nightmare disorder;5;In some cases it could be brought on by the content of home life,movies,books and music that you let yourself consume.
Nightmare disorder;6;Most people with nightmare disorder or usually pessimistic or experiencing bad thoughts throughout the day which can be collected in the dream state to create what they witness in their dreams.
Hypothyroidism;1;Hypothyroidism is a medical condition.
Hypothyroidism;2;If a person has hypothyroidism, their thyroid gland does not make enough hormones.
Hypothyroidism;3;It can be caused by many factors, but it is more common when a person has insufficient iodine.
Hypothyroidism;4;Severe hypothyroidism in infants can result in cretinism.
Hypothyroidism;5;Symptoms of hypothyroidism include the following: tiredness, headaches, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and poor concentration.
Hypothyroidism;6;Symptoms   Signs   Fatigue   Dry, coarse skin   Feeling cold   Cool extremities   Poor memory and concentration   Myxedema (mucopolysaccharide deposits in the skin)   Constipation   Hair loss   Weight gain with poor appetite   Slow pulse rate   Shortness of breath   Swelling of the limbs   Hoarse voice   Delayed relaxation of tendon reflexes   Heavy periods (and later light periods)   Carpal tunnel syndrome   Abnormal sensation   Pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion   Poor hearing
Hypochondriasis;1;Hypochondriasis (more well known as hypochondria) is a condition which involves excess worries about having an illness that often results from having inaccurate perceptions of the human body.
Hypochondriasis;2;People with hypochondria are often very worried about their health even though there is no real medical condition.
Hypochondriasis;3;They become unduly alarmed of even the slightest physical symptom in their very bodies and are convinced they are about to become sick or have health problems.
Croup;1;Croup (or laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat.
Croup;2;This swelling causes problems with normal breathing.
Croup;3;"People with croup can have a "" barking "" cough, stridor (a high-pitched wheezing sound), and hoarseness."
Croup;4;Croup symptoms often get worse at night.
Croup;5;Taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition.
Croup;6;Sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases.
Croup;7;Hospitalization is rarely required.
Croup;8;Doctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities (for example, an airway foreign body).
Croup;9;Blood tests, X-rays, and cultures are not needed.
Croup;10;Croup is common.
Croup;11;About 15% of children between 6 months and 5–6 years old get croup.
Croup;12;Teenagers and adults rarely get croup.
Croup;13;"Croup symptoms include a "" barking "" cough, stridor ( a high pitched sound typically when breathing in), hoarseness, and difficult breathing that are worse at night."
Croup;14;"The "" barking "" cough can sound like a seal or sea lion."
Croup;15;"Crying can make the wheezing worse; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed."
Croup;16;As croup gets worse, the wheezing can decrease.
Croup;17;Other symptoms are fever, symptoms typical of the common cold), and the skin between the ribs pulling in when the child breathes.
Croup;18;Drooling or a sick appearance can mean a different illness.
Croup;19;The virus infection leads to swelling in the throat and air passages that can make breathing difficult.
Croup;20;Most croup is caused by a virus infection.
Croup;21;Some people call severe laryngotracheitis croup.
Croup;22;This disease is caused by a milder virus.
Croup;23;Croup also can be laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis.
Croup;24;These diseases are caused by bacteria and are more severe.
Croup;25;In 75% of cases, the parainfluenza virus, mainly types 1 and 2, causes croup.
Croup;26;Other viruses that can cause croup include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Croup;27;Spasmodic croup (croup with barking) does not have the usual signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count).
Croup;28;Treating spasmodic croup is the same as treating regular croup.
Croup;29;Bacterial croup includes laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis.
Croup;30;"Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes laryngeal diphtheria; bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis come from a virus infection, followed by a bacteria infection."
Croup;31;The most common bacteria that cause croup areStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
Croup;32;+ The Westley Score: Classification of croup severity   Feature   Number of points assigned for this feature   0   1   2   3   4   5   Chest wall  agitation   At rest   Cyanosis   None   With  consciousness   Normal   Disoriented   Air entry   Normal   Decreased   Markedly decreased   Croup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms.
Croup;33;The first step is to make sure it is not another condition that can block the upper airway, especially epiglottitis (an inflammation of the tissue that covers the trachea or windpipe) , something in the airway, subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords), angioedema (swelling underneath the skin), retropharyngeal abscess (pus in the back of the throat), and bacterial tracheitis (bacterial infection in the trachea).
Croup;34;An X-ray of the neck is not routine, but if it is done, it can show a narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because the narrow shape looks like a church steeple.
Croup;35;The steeple sign does not appear in half of cases.
Croup;36;Blood tests and viral cultures (tests for the virus) can cause irritate the airway.
Croup;37;Cultures of the virus, obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration (using a tube to suck mucus out of the nose), are used to confirm the exact cause.
Croup;38;These cultures are restricted to people doing research.
Croup;39;If a person does not improve with standard treatment, further tests can be done to check for bacteria.
Croup;40;Severity   The most common system for describing the severity of croup is the Westley score.
Croup;41;This test is used for research, but does not help the person with croup.
Croup;42;Points are given for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis (blue skin coloring), stridor (wheezing), air entry, and retractions (skin on the chest pulling in).
Croup;43;"The table to the right lists the points given for each factor; the final score ranges from 0 to 17."
Croup;44;A total score of ≤ 2 points indicates mild croup.
Croup;45;The person can have barking cough and hoarseness, but there is no stridor (wheezing) when the person is resting.
Croup;46;A total score of 3–5 is moderate croup — the person has wheezing, with few other signs.
Croup;47;A total score of 6–11 is severe croup.
Croup;48;The patient has obvious wheezing and the skin on the chest wall indraws or pulls in.
Croup;49;A total score of ≥ 12 means respiratory failure is possible.
Croup;50;The barking cough and wheezing does not always happen at this stage.
Croup;51;85% of children going to the emergency department have mild disease.
Croup;52;Severe croup is rare–less than 1% of cases.
Croup;53;Immunization (vaccines) for influenza and diphtheria can prevent croup.
Croup;54;It is important to keep children with croup as calm as possible.
Croup;55;Children often are given steroids, but epinephrine is used in severe cases.
Croup;56;If the amount of blood oxygen is under 92%, the child needs oxygen.
Croup;57;People with severe croup can be hospitalized for observation.
Croup;58;"If oxygen is needed, "" blow-by "" administration (holding an oxygen source near the face of the child) is better than an oxygen mask, because it is less likely to upset a child than an oxygen mask is."
Croup;59;With treatment, less than 0.2% of people need endotracheal intubation(a tube placed into the airway).
Croup;60;Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, can be used to treat croup.
Croup;61;People begin to improve a lot within six hours after taking steroids.
Croup;62;Steroids work when given by mouth, injection, or inhalation (breathing them in), but taking them by mouth is best.
Croup;63;Most of the time, a single dose is enough.
Croup;64;Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally good.
Croup;65;Moderate to severe croup can be helped with nebulized epinephrine(an inhaled solution that widens the airway).
Croup;66;While epinephrine reduces croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours.
Croup;67;If symptoms improve for 2–4 hours after treatment and no other complications happen, the child typically can leave the hospital.
Croup;68;There is not enough evidence that other treatments for croup are helpful.
Croup;69;Clinical studies do not show that breathing hot steam or humidified air is helpful and currently it rarely is used.
Croup;70;Medical professionals do not want people to use cough medicines, which containdextromethorphan and/or guiafenesin.
Croup;71;Clinical studies also do not support inhaling heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to make it easier to breath.
Croup;72;Since most cases of croup is are diseases, antibiotics are not used unless bacteria are also suspected.
Croup;73;The antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended for bacterial infections.
Croup;74;In severe cases associated with influenza A or B, theanti neuraminidase inhibitors can be given.
Croup;75;Most of the time, croup caused by a virus is a short-term disease.
Croup;76;Croup rarely causes death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest.
Croup;77;Symptoms improve within two days, but can last for up to seven days.
Croup;78;Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis (infection of the trachea), pneumonia (lung infection), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).
Croup;79;About 15% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years will get croup.
Croup;80;Croup accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions for this age group.
Croup;81;In rare cases, children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years have croup.
Croup;82;"Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females; croup is more common in autumn (fall)."
Croup;83;"The word croup comes from the Early Modern English verb croup, meaning "" to cry hoarsely "" ; the name was first used for the disease in Scotland."
Croup;84;Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's Ancient Greece.
Croup;85;In 1826, Bretonneau distinguished croup from a virus and croup due to diphtheria.
Croup;86;"The French called croup from a virus "" faux-croup, "" using "" croup "" for a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria."
Croup;87;Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown since most people are immunized.
Otitis;1;Otitis means inflammation or infection of the ear.
Otitis;2;It can happen in both humans and other animals.
Otitis;3;"It can affect different parts of the ear:   Otitis externa, also called "" swimmer's ear, "" affects the outer ear and ear canal."
Otitis;4;Otitis media affects the middle ear.
Otitis;5;Otitis interna affects the inner ear.
Otitis;6;Symptons include ear wax, ear-ache and headaches.
Otitis;7;It often affects sinuses and throat also.
Otitis;8;Scientists have found signs of ear infections in the bones of humans who lived 15,000 years ago.
Septicemic plague;1;Septicemic (or septicaemic) plague is a deadly blood infection.
Septicemic plague;2;Abdominal pain   Bleeding due to blood clotting problems   Diarrhoea   Fever   Low blood pressure   Nausea   Organ failure   Vomiting   Note: Septicemic plague may cause death before any symptoms occur   The septicemic plague was the least common of the three plagues that occurred from 1348 to 1350.
Septicemic plague;3;Like the others, the septicemic plague spread from the East through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea.
Septicemic plague;4;Major port cities such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest.
Septicemic plague;5;The three plagues that are part of the Black Death were a major factor in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.

Rheumatoid arthritis;1;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious, painful, and chronic (long-lasting) disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis;2;It is an autoimmune disease - a disease where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells.
Rheumatoid arthritis;3;When a person has RA, their immune system attacks the joints and the tissues around the joints in the body.
Rheumatoid arthritis;4;This causes different problems, like:   The capsules around the joints get swollen   The body makes too much synovial fluid (the special fluid that is supposed to cushion the joints)   Tough fibrous tissue builds up in the synovium area (which is also supposed to help cushion the joints)   Eventually, RA can destroy a person's articular cartilage.
Rheumatoid arthritis;5;Normally, articular (having to do with the joints) cartilage covers the end of bones where they come together to form joints.
Rheumatoid arthritis;6;This keeps the bones from rubbing against each other.
Rheumatoid arthritis;7;If the articular cartilage has been destroyed by RA, the bones will rub against each other, which is very painful.
Rheumatoid arthritis;8;No one knows what causes RA, but some theories are that it has to do with hormones, environment, infection and genes.
Rheumatoid arthritis;9;There is no cure, but doctors have determined ways to help slow down and reduce the impact of the disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis;10;Women are two to three times more likely than men to get rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis;11;Most cases of RA occur in people between the ages of 25 and 55.
Rheumatoid arthritis;12;RA was first recognized around 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais.
Rheumatoid arthritis;13;Symptoms may include:   Swelling, stiffness, and pain around affected joints   Fever   A feeling of discomfort and tiredness   Often, people with RA also develop anemia, a different disease that causes a person to have not enough blood cells in the blood.
Rheumatoid arthritis;14;Less often, a person with RA could have:   inflamed blood vessels   neck pain
Varicose veins;1;Varicose veins are a condition in which the veins in the leg area have become enlarged.
Varicose veins;2;If veins have become varicose, the leaflets of the valves do not work properly, and in turn, the vein valves themselves won't work.
Varicose veins;3;The blood then flows backwards, at which point the veins then start to increase.
Varicose veins;4;This condition is most common in superficial veins which involve the legs.
Varicose veins;5;The condition not only causes cosmetic troubles, it also creates itching and painful problems.
Teenage pregnancy;1;Teenage pregnancy is a situation which involves female adolescents.
Teenage pregnancy;2;A teenage female is a female between 13 to 21 in age.
Teenage pregnancy;3;But sometimes preteens (people under 13) can become pregnant as well.
Teenage pregnancy;4;The fact that teenagers become pregnant is related to many factors.
Teenage pregnancy;5;These are related to the specific situation of the teenager, and the group that she interacts with.
Teenage pregnancy;6;The rates of teenage pregnancy vary from country to country and are related to differences of sexual activities, the general sex education and contraceptives being available.
Teenage pregnancy;7;Teen pregnancy will sometimes involve low birth weight.
Teenage pregnancy;8;Social matters also play a role: Often, the teenager grew up in poverty.
Teenage pregnancy;9;She also often has a lower level of general education.
Teenage pregnancy;10;Pregnancy in teenagers in the developed world usually occurs outside of marriage.
Teenage pregnancy;11;The lowest levels of teenage pregnancy are in Japan and South Korea.
Teenage pregnancy;12;Teenage pregnancies have a number of problems:   There is a higher risk that babies born from teenage mothers are born too early, or that they have a low weight at birth.
Teenage pregnancy;13;"The mothers may also encounter complications or difficulties at birth; they have a higher risk of anaemia than mothers aged 20–24."
Teenage pregnancy;14;A pregnancy is best followed by trained medical staff during its course.
Teenage pregnancy;15;Teenage mothers are less likely to receive prenatal care, often seeking it in the third trimester, if at all.
Teenage pregnancy;16;The Guttmacher Institute reports that one-third of pregnant teens receive insufficient prenatal care and that their children are more likely to suffer from health issues in childhood or be hospitalized than those born to older women.
Teenage pregnancy;17;Like most other teenagers, teenage mothers may suffer from poor nutrition.
Teenage pregnancy;18;This may lead to them having specific illnesses related to bad nutrition.
Teenage pregnancy;19;Bad nutrition is a more marked problem of teenagers in developed countries.
Teenage pregnancy;20;Up to 70,000 teen girls in developing countries die from complications during pregnancy each year.
Teenage pregnancy;21;Young mothers and their babies are also at greater risk of contracting HIV.
Teenage pregnancy;22;The World Health Organization estimates that the risk of death following pregnancy is twice as high for women between 15 and 19 years than for those between the ages of 20 and 24.
Teenage pregnancy;23;The maternal mortality rate can be up to five times higher for girls aged between 10 and 14 than for women of about twenty years of age.
Teenage pregnancy;24;Illegal abortion also holds many risks for teenage girls in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa.
Teenage pregnancy;25;"Risk for complications are higher for girl 14 years or younger, because their pelvis has not yet developed fully; this may lead to probems with childbirth."
Teenage pregnancy;26;Some of these problems can be dealt with using Cesarean section (C Section)This requires the services of a doctor, or a hospital, which is often unavailable.
Teenage pregnancy;27;Where this is unavailable, eclampsia, obstetric fistula, infant mortality, or maternal death can result.
Teenage pregnancy;28;For mothers in their late teens, age in itself is not a risk factor, and poor outcomes are associated more with socioeconomic factors rather than with biology.
Teenage pregnancy;29;Problems other than the age of the mother, such as poverty and social support also affect the outcome.
Teenage pregnancy;30;It is important that teenage mothers can rely on the family and the state to help them cope, and educate their child.
Teenage pregnancy;31;Teenage parents who can rely on family and community support, social services and child-care support are more likely to continue their education and get higher paying jobs as they progress with their education.
Teenage pregnancy;32;Being a young mother often affects education.
Teenage pregnancy;33;Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school.
Teenage pregnancy;34;Recent studies, though, have found that many of these mothers had already dropped out of school prior to becoming pregnant.
Teenage pregnancy;35;One study in 2001 found that women who gave birth during their teens completed secondary-level schooling 10–12% as often and pursued post-secondary education 14–29% as often as women who waited until age 30.
Teenage pregnancy;36;A large cause of teenage pregnancy is a lack of education about sex and pregnancy.
Teenage pregnancy;37;The first to be blamed are schools and teachers, but the real starting point should be from within the family.
Teenage pregnancy;38;Sometimes parents might think talking about sex is inappropriate or that it is automatically encouraging their children to have sex, so they avoid talking about it entirely.
Teenage pregnancy;39;This leaves kids with information only from their peers, which often includes pressure to engage in sex acts to meet social standards.
Teenage pregnancy;40;Parents should realize that in attempting to protect their children from the reality of human sexuality they are causing more harm than good.
Teenage pregnancy;41;Open discussion about sex in a safe, nonjudgmental environment is essential to helping minors make educated decisions about sex.
Teenage pregnancy;42;Pediatricians also take it upon themselves to make up for the information that has not been properly communicated to teens, and continually recognize better education as the key to helping reduce teen pregnancy.
Edema;1;REDIRECT Oedema
Necrotizing fasciitis;1;Necrotizing fasciitis is a major, but rare, condition that affects deep layers of human skin and tissues.
Necrotizing fasciitis;2;The problem is treated very quickly under antibiotics.
Necrotizing fasciitis;3;In more severe cases the area affected may need major surgery or amputation.
Necrotizing fasciitis;4;Many people with the condition may also have other issues, such as diabetes.
Necrotizing fasciitis;5;The condition is caused by bacteria.
Necrotizing fasciitis;6;Other names for the disease are flesh-eating disease or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome.
Hammer toe;1;Hammer toes are a condition of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the second, third, fourth or fifth toe.
Hammer toe;2;The condition makes the toe permanently bent, and resembles a hammer.
Hammer toe;3;The mallet toe is a very similar issue which affects the distal joint area.
Hammer toe;4;Some people are born with these issues.
Hammer toe;5;Usually, these issues happen due to the wear of poorly fitting shoes that often force the toe to bend (particularly high heels) or shoes which are too narrow or short.

Ectopic pregnancy;1;An ectopic pregnancy is a when an embryo implants itself (sticks to somewhere) outside the uterus.
Ectopic pregnancy;2;In a normal pregnancy, the embryo implants (sticks) itself into the wall of the uterus.
Ectopic pregnancy;3;The uterus is the only place in the body where an embryo can grow into a fetus.
Ectopic pregnancy;4;Most ectopic pregnancies happen in a Fallopian tube (one of the two tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus).
Ectopic pregnancy;5;For this reason, ectopic pregnancies are often called tubal pregnancies.
Ectopic pregnancy;6;Rarely, ectopic pregnancies can happen in an ovary or in the cervix.
Ectopic pregnancy;7;Ectopic pregnancies cannot become normal pregnancies, and will not result in a baby.
Ectopic pregnancy;8;They can also cause serious health problems for the mother.
Ectopic pregnancy;9;Risk factors (things that make a woman more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy) include:   Having an ectopic pregnancy before   Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)   Damage to the Fallopian tubes caused by surgery   Fallopian tubes that are not a normal shape   Getting pregnant after having a tubal ligation or while an IUD is in place.
Ectopic pregnancy;10;At first, there may be no symptoms.
Ectopic pregnancy;11;A woman may not even know she is pregnant at this point.
Ectopic pregnancy;12;Sometimes she might have pain in her pelvis, or bleeding from her vagina.
Ectopic pregnancy;13;But once the embryo has grown for about 6 to 8 weeks, it gets large enough to make the Fallopian tube rupture (break open).
Ectopic pregnancy;14;This is a medical emergency, and can kill a woman.
Ectopic pregnancy;15;Once the Fallopian tube has ruptured, it will start to bleed into the abdomen.
Ectopic pregnancy;16;Symptoms will include:   Pain that starts very quickly and is very sharp.
Ectopic pregnancy;17;The pain will be right above the pubic area, but only on one side at first.
Ectopic pregnancy;18;After a while, the pain will spread to the rest of the abdomen.
Ectopic pregnancy;19;As the Fallopian tube bleeds, the blood irritates the rest of the abdomen and causes pain.
Ectopic pregnancy;20;Eventually, the woman can lose so much blood by bleeding into her abdomen that she can faint, go into shock, or die.
Ectopic pregnancy;21;A physician can do an exam of the pelvis to test for sensitivity and pain, to figure out if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancy;22;There are also blood tests for the pregnancy hormone hCG.
Ectopic pregnancy;23;In a normal pregnancy, the hGC levels double every day.
Ectopic pregnancy;24;Low levels are evidence of a problem, like an ectopic pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancy;25;An ultrasound can also be used to see if the embryo is implanted in the uterus or not.
Ectopic pregnancy;26;There are two main ways to treat an ectopic pregnancy if it is diagnosed before the Fallopian tube ruptures.
Ectopic pregnancy;27;The first is with the medicine methotrexate.
Ectopic pregnancy;28;If it is given early enough, it can cause an abortion and end the pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancy;29;The second is with a surgery called a laparoscopy (a surgery done with a laser).
Ectopic pregnancy;30;The surgeon makes a small cut in the belly and removes the embryo.
Ectopic pregnancy;31;A laparoscopy is done after the first few weeks of the pregnancy.
Ectopic pregnancy;32;Once the Fallopian tube ruptures, emergency surgery is needed to fix the broken Fallopian tube and remove the blood from inside the abdomen.
Ectopic pregnancy;33;The patient may also needed to be treated for blood loss.
Ectopic pregnancy;34;An ectopic pregnancy cannot become a baby.
Ectopic pregnancy;35;But it can have effects on future pregnancies and fertility.
Ectopic pregnancy;36;Because in an ectopic pregnancy the embryo usually grows in a Fallopian tube, the Fallopian tube can become damaged.
Ectopic pregnancy;37;This makes it more likely for another embryo to get stuck there.
Ectopic pregnancy;38;The likeness of another ectopic pregnancy depends on the amount of damage to the Fallopian tube, and the health of the tubes.
Ectopic pregnancy;39;However, even after a ectopic pregnancy, it is entirely possible to have a normal pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes;1;Gestational diabetes (or gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM) is a condition in which females who previously were not having diabetes exhibit higher than normal levels of blood sugar while pregnant.
Gestational diabetes;2;The illness usually shows few signs/symptoms .
Gestational diabetes;3;It is usually found during pregnancy medical checks.
Gestational diabetes;4;Up to 16% of pregnant women are affected by GDM .
Gestational diabetes;5;Pregnant women with family history of having diabetes and ethnic background have higher chances of getting the disease.
Gestational diabetes;6;Gestational diabetes is caused when a pregnant woman's body does not produce enough insulin, leading to higher than normal blood sugar levels.
Gestational diabetes;7;Some women with GDM are treated with drugs.
Gestational diabetes;8;However, healthy eating and regular exercise can help to lower the chances of getting GDM.
Gestational diabetes;9;It is still unclear what causes gestational diabetes.
Gestational diabetes;10;It may be due to the action of pregnancy hormones, blocking the action of insulin to its receptors.
Gestational diabetes;11;This prevents cells to take in glucose properly.
Gestational diabetes;12;This causes sugar to remain in blood, where it continues to rise.
Gestational diabetes;13;Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes can have many problems, such as, being too large (which may make childbirth difficult), lower than normal blood glucose, or being born too early.
Gestational diabetes;14;More serious problems include brain problems or dead before birth.
Gestational diabetes;15;In addition, women with gestational diabetes have higher risk of getting Type 2 diabetes (or, in fewer cases, Type 1 diabetes) after pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes;16;In most cases, children belonging to mothers having gestational diabetes are at higher risk of childhood obesity and Type 2 diabetes later in life.
Gestational diabetes;17;This can be stopped through healthy eating and regular exercise.
Gestational diabetes;18;Common risk factors for developing gestational diabetes are:   Polycystic Ovary Syndrome   Having gestational diabetes previously   Family history with Type 2 Diabetes   Mother's age- risk increases with age (especially for women 35 years of age)   Ethicity: African-Americans, , Native Americans, , Pacific Islanders, and people originating from South Asia   Being overweight or obese   First child being born large (high birth weight).
Gestational diabetes;19;Previous poor pregnancy experience     Smoking during pregnancy     A basic test is carried out during the first .
Gestational diabetes;20;The doctor or nurse will ask certain questions to check if the mother is at high risk of getting gestational diabetes.
Gestational diabetes;21;Woman found with higher chance of getting GDM will be offered a blood glucose test.
Gestational diabetes;22;This allows the doctor to check the correct sugar levels in the mother's blood.
Gestational diabetes;23;Light exercise and stop smoking during pregnancy can greatly help pregnant women to avoid getting GDM.
Hemopneumothorax;1;Hemopneumothorax is a medical problem where the lung is damaged and the chest fills up with air and blood.
Hemopneumothorax;2;It is treated by opening the chest and putting in a chest drain.
Hemopneumothorax;3;This can only be done by paramedics or doctors.
Hemopneumothorax;4;A hemopneumothorax often happens after high speed crashes and penetrating chest wounds.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;1;Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most prevalent female endocrine health matters.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;2;PCOS is a complex and heterogeneous problem of uncertain etiology, although there is major evidence that the PCOS can be classified as a genetic health problem.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;3;This condition produces symptoms in between five percent to ten percent of females during the reproducing ages.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;4;Problems include although are not limited to hormones resulting in acne, hirsutism, resistance to insulin (which then results in diabetes mellitus, in particular Type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults), overweight and (in some women) high cholesterol levels.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;5;The symptoms and severity vary greatly among affected women.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;6;Treatments include weight reduction, low-dose oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone and spironolactone.
Polycystic ovary syndrome;7;Clomiphene can be used as the treatment for those women who wish to get pregnant.
Hyperglycemia;1;Hyperglycemia means high blood sugar levels at or beyond 200 mg/dl.
Hyperglycemia;2;It is a serious and life threatening health problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time.
Hyperglycemia;3;In a healthy body, insulin helps glucose (sugar) get from the blood into the body's cells.
Hyperglycemia;4;There, the cells can use the sugar to make energy.
Hyperglycemia;5;However, when there is not enough insulin in the body, or if a person's body does not react to insulin normally (this is called insulin resistance), too much sugar stays in the blood.
Hyperglycemia;6;This can cause serious health problems.
Hyperglycemia;7;Extremely high blood sugar means diabetes mellitus, a condition that often causes very high blood sugar.
Hyperglycemia;8;Hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind, or may be developing under low insulin levels or resistance to insulin.
Hyperglycemia;9;"Three of the early signs of hyperglycemia are "" the 3 polys "" : polydipsia (feeling very thirsty), polyphagia (feeling very hungry), and polyuria (urinating a lot)."
Hyperglycemia;10;These things happen because:   The body senses that its cells are not getting enough sugar.
Hyperglycemia;11;The body triggers hunger, because eating is usually how people get sugar.
Hyperglycemia;12;This causes polyphagia.
Hyperglycemia;13;The body senses that there is too much sugar in the blood, and tries to urinate out the extra sugar.
Hyperglycemia;14;This causes polyuria.
Hyperglycemia;15;Because the person is urinating so much, they get dehydrated easily and get very thirsty (polydipsia).
Hyperglycemia;16;Other early signs of high blood sugar include blurred vision, headache, and feeling tired.
Hyperglycemia;17;If hyperglycemia gets worse or is not treated, it can cause toxic acids called ketones to build up in the blood and urine.
Hyperglycemia;18;This is called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a medical emergency.
Hyperglycemia;19;"Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis can include:   Confusion, seizures, or coma   Difficulty breathing with fruity-smelling breath ( "" ketone breath "" - caused by the body trying to blow off the toxic ketones through breathing out)   Weakness   Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain"

Sudden infant death syndrome;1;Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexpected death of a human baby which is unexplained even after an autopsy and investigation.
Sudden infant death syndrome;2;SIDS is sometimes referred to as cot death or crib death.
Sudden infant death syndrome;3;The name is only applied to cases where the baby is less than one year old.
Sudden infant death syndrome;4;By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year.
Sudden infant death syndrome;5;Most happen when the infant is 2 to 4 months of age.
Sudden infant death syndrome;6;This is a critical period because the infant's ability to arouse from sleep is not yet mature.
Sudden infant death syndrome;7;SIDS is defined as a syndrome.
Sudden infant death syndrome;8;Babies are at the highest risk for SIDS during their sleep.
Sudden infant death syndrome;9;"Male infants die more often than female infants; about 60% of the cases are male infants."
Sudden infant death syndrome;10;Infants also die more often during winter months.
Sudden infant death syndrome;11;The reason for SIDS are unknown, but there are different theories:   Problems with blood flow to the brain   Problems with levels of serotonin   Effects of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum (which causes botulism)   Toxic gases   Vaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS, and may reduce the risk slightly.
Sudden infant death syndrome;12;Infanticide and child abuse cases may be misdiagnosed as SIDS due to lack of evidence.
Sudden infant death syndrome;13;and caretakers of infants with SIDS are sometimes falsely accused.
Sudden infant death syndrome;14;Accidental suffocations are also sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS and vice versa.
Sudden infant death syndrome;15;Grief support for families affected by SIDS is particularly important.
Sudden infant death syndrome;16;The death of the infant is typically sudden, without witnesses, and requires an investigation.
Sudden infant death syndrome;17;A broader term, “sudden and unexpected infant death” (SUID) is used to describe all such deaths, regardless of cause.
Sudden infant death syndrome;18;Cases of SUID that remain unexplained after a complete autopsy and review of the circumstances of death and clinical history are classified as SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;19;Thus, SIDS is one of the causes of SUID and accounts for 80% of such deaths.
Sudden infant death syndrome;20;Nobody knows what causes SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;21;However, there are some known risk factors for SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;22;Not every infant who has one of these risk factors dies from SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;23;Risk factors just make it more likely for a baby to have SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;24;SIDS happens more in infants of mothers who smoke while they are pregnant.
Sudden infant death syndrome;25;The higher the levels of nicotine in the infant's blood, the higher the risk of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;26;Nicotine causes important changes in the way a fetus develops during pregnancy, which have been linked to SIDS as well as miscarriages.
Sudden infant death syndrome;27;Infants who are put to sleep on their stomachs or sides are more likely to die of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;28;This risk is highest in infants who are two to three months old.
Sudden infant death syndrome;29;"The "" Back to Sleep "" movement has encouraged parents to put their infants to sleep on their backs to prevent SIDS."
Sudden infant death syndrome;30;Other things that increase the risk for SIDS while an infant is sleeping include:   A hot or cold bedroom   Having many blankets in the infant's crib, or a lot of clothing on the infant   Soft sleeping surfaces   Having stuffed animals in the crib   Some researchers think these things can make it difficult for infants to control their body temperature, making them unable to control their breathing.
Sudden infant death syndrome;31;Infants are more likely to die of SIDS if they share a bed with parents or older children.
Sudden infant death syndrome;32;"This risk is highest:   When the infant is less than three months old;   When the mattress is soft;   When one or more people share the infant's bed; and   When people in the bed are using drugs or alcohol, or are smoking."
Sudden infant death syndrome;33;The American Academy of Pediatrics says that if parents share a room with an infant without sharing a bed, they can cut their infant's risk of SIDS in half.
Sudden infant death syndrome;34;Infants who are breastfed are less likely to die of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;35;The more an infant has been breastfed, the less likely they are to die of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;36;SIDS is less likely to happen in infants of older mothers.
Sudden infant death syndrome;37;Infants of teenage mothers are at the highest risk.
Sudden infant death syndrome;38;An infant is also at a higher risk of SIDS if:   Their mother did not get good prenatal care while she was pregnant   The infant weighs less than normal when they are born (this is called low birth weight)   The infant is born too soon (prematurely).
Sudden infant death syndrome;39;Premature infants are four times more likely to die of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;40;The infant has anemia   SIDS only happens at certain ages.
Sudden infant death syndrome;41;The risk of SIDS is highest in infants from two to four months old.
Sudden infant death syndrome;42;After the infant reaches one year old, the risk decreases and eventually reaches zero.
Sudden infant death syndrome;43;Genetics affect the risk of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;44;Baby boys have about a 50% higher risk of SIDS than baby girls.
Sudden infant death syndrome;45;Scientists think this might be because of an allele that exists on the X chromosome.
Sudden infant death syndrome;46;They think this allele helps protect against episodes where the brain does not get enough oxygen (transient cerebral anoxia).
Sudden infant death syndrome;47;Baby boys would be more likely to be missing this allele.
Sudden infant death syndrome;48;Scientists think that about 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are caused by inherited defects in the ion channels that help the heart squeeze out blood.
Sudden infant death syndrome;49;The risk of SIDS seems to be affected by things like how much education an infant's mother got, race, ethnicity, and poverty.
Sudden infant death syndrome;50;Vaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;51;Most studies have shown that getting vaccinations cuts an infant's risk of a SIDS death in half.
Sudden infant death syndrome;52;SIDS may be more common in babies with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli (E. coli) infections, but scientists are not sure.
Sudden infant death syndrome;53;Putting infants to sleep on their backs can help prevent SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;54;The number of SIDS deaths has fallen in countries where this is commonly done.
Sudden infant death syndrome;55;Also, if parents share a room with their infant but do not share a bed, they can cut their baby's risk of SIDS in half.
Sudden infant death syndrome;56;Parents can help prevent SIDS by not using pillows, very soft mattresses, stuffed animals, or fluffy blankets in their infant's crib.
Sudden infant death syndrome;57;"Dressing the infant warmly and keeping the crib "" naked "" lowers the risk of SIDS."
Sudden infant death syndrome;58;If an infant has a blanket in the crib, they should be covered only up to their chest, with their arms left outside the blanket.
Sudden infant death syndrome;59;This makes it harder for the infant to move the blanket over their head, which could cause breathing problems.
Sudden infant death syndrome;60;"In colder places where infants need help staying warm, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using a "" sleep sack. """
Sudden infant death syndrome;61;This is like a sleeping bag for a baby, but with holes for the baby's arms and head.
Sudden infant death syndrome;62;The bag is closed around the baby with a zipper.
Sudden infant death syndrome;63;This helps keep the baby warm without covering their head.
Sudden infant death syndrome;64;Sleep sacks are especially helpful for babies with low birth weight, who have more trouble keeping themselves warm.
Sudden infant death syndrome;65;Many studies have shown that vaccines normally given to infants help prevent SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;66;For example, one very large research study showed that giving infants vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis helps prevent SIDS.
Sudden infant death syndrome;67;Getting normal infant vaccines cuts infants' risk of SIDS in half, according to many studies.

Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;10;Hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies are cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;11;As the blood and lymph connect through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;12;There are three types:   Leukemia   Lymphoma   Multiple myeloma   A doctor will do some tests to find out if a person has a blood cancer.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;13;One common test is a complete blood count.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;14;The cells that circulate in the bloodstream are generally divided into three types: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;15;The relative proportions is what picks up indications of a problem.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;16;Sometimes the doctor will take a very small piece of the body out, to look at it.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;17;This is called a biopsy.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;18;Bone marrow is where new blood is made in the body.
Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues;19;A bone marrow biopsy looks at the blood-making parts to see if they have cancer.

High-functioning autism;1;High-functioning autism (HFA) is an informal term given to autistic people who are considered to be higher functioning than other autistic people, by one or more metrics.
High-functioning autism;2;The overlap between HFA and Asperger syndrome is subject to controversy.
High-functioning autism;3;There's no consensus as to the definition for high functioning autism.
High-functioning autism;4;HFA's are often alexithymic (lacking in emotion).
Rett syndrome;1;Rett syndrome is an almost entirely female based disorder which affects girls.
Rett syndrome;2;This condition is a neurological disorder which involves the brain's grey matter.
Rett syndrome;3;The clinical features include small hands and feet.
Rett syndrome;4;People with Rett syndrome also have scoliosis.
Rett syndrome;5;They might also have cognitive impairment.
Neurosis;1;Neurosis is a class of mental disorders involving distress but not delusions or hallucinations.
Neurosis;2;The person's behavior is not outside socially acceptable norms.
Neurosis;3;It is also known as psychoneurosis or neurotic disorder, and those suffering from it are said to be neurotic.
Neurosis;4;The term neurosis was coined by Scottish doctor William Cullen in 1769.
Neurosis;5;"The American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has eliminated the category of "" neurosis "" ."
Neurosis;6;The editors decided to provide descriptions of behavior instead.
Neurosis;7;"According to The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, it is "" no longer used in psychiatric diagnosis "" ."
Neurosis;8;Instead, the disorders once classified as neuroses are now considered anxiety disorders.
Neurosis;9;These changes are controversial.
Neurosis;10;"Neurosis may involve:   : "" ...anxiety, sadness or depression, anger, irritability, mental confusion, low sense of self-worth, etc., behavioral symptoms such as phobic avoidance, vigilance, impulsive and compulsive acts, lethargy, etc., cognitive problems such as unpleasant or disturbing thoughts, repetition of thoughts and obsession, habitual fantasizing, negativity and cynicism, etc."
Neurosis;11;"Interpersonally, neurosis involves dependency, aggressiveness, perfectionism, schizoid isolation, socio-culturally inappropriate behaviors, etc "" ."
Antisocial personality disorder;1;Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a personality disorder in which a person fails to conform with socially accepted behavior.
Antisocial personality disorder;2;People with this disorder often disregard social norms or the rights of other people.
Antisocial personality disorder;3;Other names for the condition are sociopathy and dissocial personality disorder (DPD).
Antisocial personality disorder;4;However, because of the many definitions of sociopathy, that word is no longer used in a medical context.
Antisocial personality disorder;5;The ASPD pattern begins in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood.
Antisocial personality disorder;6;People with ASPD have no conscience or sense of morality, although the large majority know right from wrong.
Antisocial personality disorder;7;Those with ASPD often commit crimes, have legal problems, and show behavior that is aggressive and, in the large majority of cases, impulsive, reckless and destructive.
Antisocial personality disorder;8;About three percent of men and one percent of women have ASPD.
Antisocial personality disorder;9;According to the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-IV), a person has ASPD if they fit the following requirements:   A.
Antisocial personality disorder;10;Since age 15, the person has shown a pattern of not caring about and violating others' rights.
Antisocial personality disorder;11;This pattern must be pervasive, meaning that the person habitually acts this way in different settings.
Antisocial personality disorder;12;This pattern is shown by at least three of the following actions:   #The person does not obey the law, and repeatedly does things for which he or she could be arrested   #The person often deliberately misleads and deceives others.
Antisocial personality disorder;13;He or she may do this by lying repeatedly, using aliases (false names), or conning other people (either for money or enjoyment).
Antisocial personality disorder;14;#The person is impulsive or does not plan ahead.
Antisocial personality disorder;15;#The person becomes irritated or angry easily and is aggressive.
Antisocial personality disorder;16;He or she repeatedly gets into physical fights or assaults others.
Antisocial personality disorder;17;#The person shows no concern for other people's safety or his/her own safety.
Antisocial personality disorder;18;#The person is consistently irresponsible.
Antisocial personality disorder;19;He or she may not try to keep a job or honor financial obligations, like bills and debts.
Antisocial personality disorder;20;"#The person shows no remorse for hurting others; he or she hurts, steals from, or treats others badly, without remorse."
Antisocial personality disorder;22;To be diagnosed with ASPD, the person must be at least 18 years old.
Antisocial personality disorder;23;C. By age 15, he or she seemed to exhibit conduct disorder.
Antisocial personality disorder;24;D. The person's antisocial behavior is not caused by schizophrenia or a manic episode.
Antisocial personality disorder;25;ASPD is not the same as psychopathy.
Antisocial personality disorder;26;"The two are similar; people with both conditions may show similar behaviors."
Antisocial personality disorder;27;However, they are diagnosed differently.
Antisocial personality disorder;28;Using the DSM criteria, a diagnosis of ASPD is based on a person's behaviors.
Antisocial personality disorder;29;No official, agreed-upon definition or set of diagnostic criteria exists for psychopathy, but most tools that measure psychopathy focus on personality characteristics as well as behaviors.
Antisocial personality disorder;30;Most people who score highly on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), the most popular measure of psychopathy, also qualify for ASPD.
Antisocial personality disorder;31;However, people with ASPD do not routinely score high on the PCL-R.
Antisocial personality disorder;32;This suggests that most psychopaths qualify for ASPD, but most people with ASPD do not qualify as psychopaths.
Antisocial personality disorder;33;The diagnosis of ASPD covers most psychopaths, as well as many more people who are not psychopaths.
Antisocial personality disorder;34;The diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners as the diagnosis of psychopathy does.
Antisocial personality disorder;35;Depending on the behaviour, different ASPD subtypes have been identified:   Intrumentalized type: People classified in this subtype care about power, material goods and money.
Antisocial personality disorder;36;They are very self-confident and lack feelings such as remorse, empathy or fear.
Antisocial personality disorder;37;They do not want to change their behaviour.
Antisocial personality disorder;38;"This type is very similar to what used to be called "" psychopathy. """
Antisocial personality disorder;39;Impulsive type: These people are very impulsive, have difficulty controlling their actions, and are quick to judge other people's actions as negative.
Antisocial personality disorder;40;In most cases, the person suffering will not notice this inability.
Antisocial personality disorder;41;"These people are also very emotional; emotions such as fear and anger are common."
Antisocial personality disorder;42;They are easily frustrated and quickly show aggressive behaviour.
Antisocial personality disorder;43;These people do not look for material gain.
Antisocial personality disorder;44;Fearful type: These people often suffer from depression, and are shy or fearful.
Antisocial personality disorder;45;When provoked, their level of violent behaviour is excessive, and often greater than that of the other types.
Antisocial personality disorder;46;Outside these eruptions they are in control, and hardly get noticed.
Antisocial personality disorder;47;Very often, this group has lived through traumatic events.
Antisocial personality disorder;48;Mixed types also occur.
Antisocial personality disorder;49;There is a debate on the subtypes.
Williams syndrome;1;Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare development problem.
Williams syndrome;2;"It is characterized by a distinct "" elfin "" facial appearance, strong language skills and cardiovascular troubles."
Williams syndrome;3;There is a degree of low intelligence tied to Williams syndrome.
Williams syndrome;4;There are also language and motor skills delays.

Pervasive developmental disorder;1;Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), are a group of disorders.
Pervasive developmental disorder;2;There are five disorders in the group.
Pervasive developmental disorder;3;These disorders all slow down the rate a child learns to talk and listen to others, as well as cause other problems.
Pervasive developmental disorder;4;The five disorders are:   Pervasive disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).
Pervasive developmental disorder;5;Autism   Asperger Syndrome   Rett syndrome   Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD)   The first three of these disorders are also called autism spectrum disorders.
Pervasive developmental disorder;6;The last two are not common.
Pervasive developmental disorder;7;A child's parents might begin to notice signs of PDD when the child is a baby, and it usually appears before the child is three years old.

Female sexual arousal disorder;14;You have pain associated with sexual stimulation or vaginal contact.
Spinal muscular atrophy;1;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a serious disease that causes nerves and muscles to stop working.
Spinal muscular atrophy;2;Babies affected by SMA often get weak and might die after their lungs fail, and if disease develops in older children or adults they will gradually lose the ability to move their bodies.
Spinal muscular atrophy;3;Spinal muscular atrophy is inherited from parents who might or might not have the disease themselves but both of whom have a fault (mutation) in their genes that predisposes to the disease.
Spinal muscular atrophy;4;Around one in 25 to one in 50 persons, depending on the country, carries a faulty gene of SMA.
Spinal muscular atrophy;5;Spinal muscular atrophy is the most common genetic disease causing death of babies.
Spinal muscular atrophy;6;Only one medicine helps in SMA, it is called Spinraza.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;1;REDIRECT Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
Chorea;1;Chorea (sometimes called Choreia) is the name for a set of symptoms caused by some neurological conditions.
Chorea;2;"The word "" chorea "" comes from Greek, where it means "" dance "" ."
Chorea;3;People with chorea move without being able to control those movements.
Chorea;4;The movements seem to spread from one muscle to the next.
Chorea;5;Chorea is one of the main symptoms of Huntington's disease.
Chorea;6;Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions, though.
Chorea;7;Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy.
Chorea;8;It can be a sign of hyperthyroidism.
Chorea;9;It can also be caused by drugs taken in the wrong dose.
Chorea;10;For example, L-Dopa (taken against Parkinson's disease), certain forms of birth control, or certain antipsychotics can cause chorea if they are used in the wrong doses.
Cellulitis;1;Cellulitis is an infection of the skin, caused by bacteria.
Cellulitis;2;Very often, the face is affected.
Cellulitis;3;The disease should not be confused with cellulite.
Cellulitis;4;Cellulitis is caused by bacteria, usually staphylococcus or streptococcus, which can get through a break in the skin.
Cellulitis;5;These breaks can be caused by a wound, cracks in the skin, insect bites, or problems with the bodies immune system.
Cellulitis;6;The infection causes the skin to become red, hot and painful.
Cellulitis;7;It can also cause a fever.
Cellulitis;8;It is usually treated by taking antibiotic drugs.
Joubert syndrome;1;Joubert syndrome is a genetic birth defect.
Joubert syndrome;2;The cerebellum of people with the disorders is not developed normally.
Joubert syndrome;3;The disorder does not occur very often.
Joubert syndrome;4;Since its first description in 1969, a few hundred cases have been described.
Joubert syndrome;5;It is a ciliopathy.
Joubert syndrome;6;Mutations at 21 different loci have been found to cause Joubert syndrome.
Joubert syndrome;7;Research has shown that a number of genetic disorders may be related as to their root cause.
Joubert syndrome;8;Joubert syndrome is one such disease.
Joubert syndrome;9;It is a member of a class of diseases called ciliopathies.
Joubert syndrome;10;The underlying cause of the ciliopathies may be defects in the mechanism of cilia in the cell.
Joubert syndrome;11;Cilia are organelles which are present in many cell types in the body.
Joubert syndrome;12;"The cilia defects damage "" critical developmental signaling pathways "" essential to cell development."
Joubert syndrome;13;This explains the multi-symptom nature of many syndromes and diseases.
Joubert syndrome;14;Currently about nine ciliopathies are known, including Joubert syndrome.

Addison's disease;2;U.S. President John F. Kennedy is probably one of the most famous sufferers though his condition was kept secret during his presidency.
Addison's disease;3;Addision's disease is when the body does not produce enough of the hormone called cortisol.
Addison's disease;4;This hormone helps the body deal with stress.
Addison's disease;5;It helps with maintaining blood pressure and controlling the heart's functions.
Addison's disease;6;It slows the rate of inflammation caused by the body's immune system.
Addison's disease;7;It helps with controlling the way insulin is used, and the chemical reactions of proteins, carbohydrates and fats in the body.
Addison's disease;8;People with the disease suffer from weight loss, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.
Addison's disease;9;Some people also get darkened patches of skin.
Addison's disease;10;Addison's disease is treated by taking an artificial cortisol tablet.

Carcinoma;1;redirect Cancer
Pituitary adenoma;1;Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland.
Pituitary adenoma;2;Pituitary tumors are generally divided into three kinds dependant upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma or carcinomas, with carcinomas accounting for 0.1% to 0.2%, appoximately 35% being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas.
Pituitary adenoma;3;Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all brain tumors and is thought to happen in about 17% to 25% of most people.
Pituitary adenoma;4;"Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign [harmless]; but a recent large study (Fernández-Balsells, et al."
Pituitary adenoma;5;2011) has shown there are few studies to prove if this is true or not.
Pituitary adenoma;6;Adenomas that are bigger than are called macroadenomas, and those smaller than 10 mm are called microadenomas.
Pituitary adenoma;7;Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas.
Pituitary adenoma;8;Most pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding [which means found by chance], and are called incidentalomas.
Pituitary adenoma;9;Invasive adenomas may invade the dura mater, cranial bone, or sphenoid bone.
Pituitary adenoma;10;It used to be thought that clinically active pituitary adenomas were rare but recent studies have suggested that they may affect about one in 1000 of the general population.
Acromegaly;1;Acromegaly is a medical condition that happens when the anterior (rear) pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone (GH), after a person has passed puberty.
Acromegaly;2;If this happens before puberty it causes a condition known as gigantism.
Acromegaly;3;A number of medical conditions may cause the pituitary gland to make too much growth hormone, but the most common cause is a tumor on the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma'   Acromegaly is most commonly diagnosed in middle aged adults, and can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and early death if not treated.
Acromegaly;4;Acromegaly is hard to diagnose when it is just beginning.
Acromegaly;5;It is usually not found until 10–12 years after it starts.
Acromegaly;6;This is when it causes changes in the way a person looks, especially their face.
Acromegaly;7;Headaches   Vision problems   Hirsutism (in women): the growth of hair on the face.
Acromegaly;8;Frontal bossing: the bone underneath the forehead becomes bigger than normal.
Acromegaly;9;Prognathism: part of the face sticks out more than normal usually the lower jaw.
Acromegaly;10;Fatigue: the person is often tired.
Acromegaly;11;High blood pressure   Skin tags: Small wart-like growth on the skin which is not cancerous.
Acromegaly;12;Hyperhidrosis: when a person sweats too much.
Acromegaly;13;Bromhidrosis: Body odor   Hepatomegaly   Enlargement of hands and feet   Cardiomyopathy   Colonic cancer
Prognathism;1;Prognathism describes when part or all of the face sticks out more than normal.
Prognathism;2;Humans have orthognathic faces.
Prognathism;3;That means the faces is more or less vertical.
Prognathism;4;Most other primates have prognathic faces: their jaws stick out in front of the top part of the head.
Prognathism;5;Nasal prognathism: is when the portion of the face around and including the nose sticks out.
Prognathism;6;Also called upper facial projection.
Prognathism;7;Alveolar prognathism: is when the alveolar (dental) part of the upper jaw (maxilla) sticks out.
Prognathism;8;Also called mid-facial projection.
Prognathism;9;"Often causes what is called an "" overbite "" ."
Prognathism;10;Mandibular prognathism: is when the mandible (lower jaw) sticks out.
Prognathism;11;"Often called an "" underbite "" ."
Skin tag;1;A skin tag is a small growth on the skin that is usually benign (harmless).
Skin tag;2;It may have a short narrow stalk which connects it to the skin.
Skin tag;3;They are usually small but may grow up to a half-inch long.
Skin tag;4;Skin tags are usually harmless and do not need treatment.
Skin tag;5;A person may decide to have a skin tag removed if it is irritating them or they do not like the way it looks.
Skin tag;6;If so the skin tag may be removed by:   Surgery: removed using a scalpel or surgical scissors.
Skin tag;7;Cryotherapy: freezing it.
Skin tag;8;Cauterization: burning it off.
Hyperhidrosis;1;Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person sweats too much.
Hyperhidrosis;2;It is often caused by overactive sweat glands.
Hyperhidrosis;3;People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when it is cool and they are at rest.
Hyperhidrosis;4;The sweat glands on any area of the human body can be affected by hyperhidrosis but it is usually happens more often in the sweat glands of the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet and the armpits.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;1;Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome (Hb Lepore) is a kind of blood disorder that is caused by a genetic mutation.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;2;It was first found in an Italian-American family named Lepore.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;3;When a genetic mutation runs in families it is known as a trait.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;4;The Hb Lepore trait is found worldwide and may affect people of various races, however the three main kinds of Hb Lepore, usually affects Caucasians of the Southern regions of Central and Eastern Europe.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;5;"There are three main kinds of Hb Lepore are named for the areas they were first found in, with various subtypes, the three main kinds are:   Washington (Hb Lepore Washington, also known as Hb Lepore Boston or Hb Lepore Washington-Boston); most common in Italians from Southern Italy   Baltimore (Hb Lepore Baltimore); first described in a family with African ancestry; most common in people from the Balkan countries, Albanians Croats, Serbs, Slovenes and Romanians."
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;6;It has also been described in Turks and in regions of Spain and Portugal.
Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome;7;"A rare case of the Baltimore variety was discovered in an African American woman in the Bronx, New York and dubbed Hn Lepore-Bronx and another variety was discovered in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada and dubbed Hb E-Lepore Saskatoon   Hollandia (Hb Lepore Hollandia); identified in Papua New Guinea and Bangladesh."
Silent stroke;1;A silent stroke is a kind of stroke that does not cause symptoms that can be seen in a major stroke such as slurred speech.
Silent stroke;2;A person who has had a silent stroke usually does not know it.
Silent stroke;3;A silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future.
Silent stroke;4;"These strokes are called "" silent "" because they typically happen in parts of the brain that do not cause problems that can be seen like those in a major stroke."
Silent stroke;5;A silent stroke usually happens in parts of the brain that control different thought processes, mood regulation and cognitive functions and is a leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment and may also lead to a loss of urinary bladder control.
Silent stroke;6;In a big study in 1998, more than 11 million people were thought to have had a stroke in the United States.
Silent stroke;7;About 770,000 of these strokes had symptoms which could be seen and 11 million were first-ever silent strokes.
Silent stroke;8;Silent strokes usually cause lesions which are found by the use of neuroimaging such as MRI.
Silent stroke;9;There is more of chance of older people having a silent stroke but it may also happen to younger adults.
Silent stroke;10;Women appear to be at higher risk for silent stroke, with hypertension and current cigarette smoking being some of the reasons.
Silent stroke;11;These types of strokes include lacunar and other ischemic strokes and minor hemorrhages.
Silent stroke;12;They may also include leukoaraiosis (changes in the white matter of the brain): the white matter is more susceptible to vascular blockage because it has less blood vessels than the cerebral cortex.
Silent stroke;13;In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a study used 3,660 adults over the age of 65, 31% showed evidence of silent stroke in neuroimaging studies using MRI.
Silent stroke;14;These people did not know they had a stroke.
Silent stroke;15;It is thought that silent strokes are five times more common than strokes that have symptoms.
Silent stroke;16;A silent stroke is different than a transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Silent stroke;17;In TIA the symptoms can be seen and may last from a few minutes to 24 hours before getting better.
Silent stroke;18;If a person has a TIA there is a bigger chance they may have a major stroke and silent strokes in the future.
Silent stroke;19;Ischemic stroke: occurs when a blood vessel that brings blood to the brain becomes blocked.
Silent stroke;20;This type of stroke happens in 87 percent of all stroke cases.
Silent stroke;21;Hemorrhagic stroke: occurs when a blood vessel that brings blood to the brain gets weak and splits open causing bleed to come out of the blood vessel.
Silent stroke;22;Usually hemorrhagic stroke is caused by two kinds of problems that cause weak blood vessels: aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
Silent stroke;23;Lacunar infarcts (LACI) are small (0.2 to 15 mm in diameter) noncortical (does not happen in the cerebral cortex) stroke caused by the blockage of a single penetrating branch of a larger blood vessel that brings blood to the inside parts of the brain including the white matter.
Silent stroke;24;LACIs are usually happen in cases of white matter lesions (WML) which can be seen using computerized tomography (CT scans).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;1;"Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short) is a medical problem that happens in children. """
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;2;"Benign "" means "" harmless; "" "" paroxysmal "" means something comes and goes suddenly; and "" vertigo "" means "" dizziness. """
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;3;So BPVC is harmless dizziness in children that comes and goes suddenly.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;4;The dizziness usually makes children feel like they are moving or spinning, or that the inside of their head is moving or spinning.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;5;Usually, BPVC starts in children between two and five years old.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;6;It often goes away by the age of eight.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;7;But in some children, BPVC may start when they are much younger (as young as a few months old) or older (as old as 12 years old).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;8;BPVC is the most common cause of dizziness in children who do not have hearing loss or a diagnosed ear disease.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;9;It is a common problem that happens to about 2.6% of children (26 out of 1,000 children).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;10;Doctors don't know for sure what causes BPVC.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;11;Some doctors think it is related to problems of the inner ear that affect balance.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;12;For example, some doctors think BPVC is similar to a different disorder which often happens in adults over 50.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;13;This disorder is called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;14;"BPPV is a "" vestibular disorder "" - a disorder in the inner ear which affects balance."
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;15;Other doctors believe BPVC is related to migraine headaches, but most children with BPVC do not get headaches.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;16;"Nystagmus (sometimes called "" dancing eyes "" ): Fast, uncontrollable eye movements."
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;17;These eye movements may happen on their own or be caused by staring.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;18;When a child with BPVC is not having other symptoms, they may have positional nystagmus, which happens when the head is in a certain position.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;19;Nausea: Feeling like throwing up.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;20;Vomiting: Throwing up.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;21;Gait ataxia: Problems walking because a medical problem (like BPVC) makes the muscles not work together.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;22;This symptom may be harder to see in infants who cannot walk yet.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;23;Postural imbalance: Having trouble staying balanced, which makes it hard to stand up straight.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;24;This symptom may be harder to see in infants who cannot stand yet.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;25;Looking scared: Children may look scared because of the physical symptoms that BPVC is causing, like loss of balance and dizziness.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;26;For a doctor to diagnose Benign Paroxysmal Vertigo of Childhood, all of these things must be true:   The child has had at least five attacks of vertigo.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;27;"The child gets vertigo a lot; the dizziness happens all of a sudden, and goes away after a few minutes to a few hours."
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;28;The child had a normal neurological examination (which tests whether there are problems with how the brain is working)   The child had normal audiometric and vestibular functions between attacks (this means that between attacks, the child had normal hearing, and there were no obvious problems with the inner ears)   The child had normal electroencephalography (EEG) (this is a test that looks for unusual electrical activity in the brain).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;29;Differential diagnoses are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;30;"When a doctor asks what the differential diagnoses for BPVC are, she is asking "" what other disease could cause these symptoms?"
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;31;"What else could this be? """
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;32;Before a doctor makes a final diagnosis, they must think of what other medical conditions have the same or similar symptoms, and make sure one of them is not the problem.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;33;Some of the differential diagnoses for BPVC are:   Posterior fossa tumor: A tumor in the part of the brain that is in or near the bottom of the skull.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;34;Posterior fossa tumors happen more in children than they do in adults.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;35;About 54%-70% of all brain tumors that children get start in the posterior fossa.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;36;Cervical spine abnormalities: Problems with the part of the spine in the neck.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;37;Otological disorders: Problems with the insides of the ears.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;38;Benign occipital epilepsy: A kind of epilepsy that most children outgrow.
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood;39;Metabolic disorders: Problems with the way the body makes energy from food.
Menstrual migraine;1;Menstrual migraine (also called catamenial migraine) is term used to describe both true menstrual migraines and menstrually related migraines.
Menstrual migraine;2;Menstrual migraine attacks usually last longer than other migraine attacks, [Pinkerman and Holroyd, 2010 ] and short-term treatments do not work as well with menstrual migraine as they do in other kinds of migraine.
Menstrual migraine;3;The three questions are:   #Do migraines occur in the space of time 2 days before the beginning of a woman's period, until the third day after the start of the period.
Menstrual migraine;4;Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and other kinds of antidepressant medications are often used for migraine prevention.
Menstrual migraine;5;These include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and doxepin.
Menstrual migraine;6;Acute treatments (short-term treatment) include drugs called Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (drugs that help stop inflammation which is redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, heat in parts of the body), triptans such as Frovatriptan, ergotomines which are a kind of drug made from a fungus called ergot, and estrogen transdermal patches, which are patches worn on the skin that have estrogen in them which enters the body through the skin and then into the bloodstream.
Menstrual migraine;7;The exact causes of menstrual migraine are not known for sure but there is a link between falling levels of the female hormone estrogen and the onset of a migraine attack.
Menstrual migraine;8;The estrogen level may fall after bleeding occurs during the menstrual cycle or when external sources of estrogen are no longer taken, like when a woman stops taking birth control pills or hormone pills in hormone replacement therapy.
Menstrual migraine;9;Optimizing Management of Menstrual Migraine
Aura (symptom);1;An aura is the changes that people see, hear, smell, taste, or feel before they have an epileptic seizure, or before they have a migraine.
Aura (symptom);2;It comes from the Greek word for breeze.
Aura (symptom);3;The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition.
Aura (symptom);4;There are different kinds of migraines.
Aura (symptom);5;About 15% of people who have a migraine will have an aura.
Aura (symptom);6;The symptoms may include visual problems like not being able to see for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus), and problems speaking.
Aura (symptom);7;It may take up to an hour after the aura begins before a person starts getting a migraine.
Aura (symptom);8;Many people with epilepsy have an aura before having a seizure.
Aura (symptom);9;This can be helpful, because the aura can tell the person that a seizure is coming ahead of time, and give them time to get to a safe place.
Aura (symptom);10;The time between the aura and the seizure is usually short (often from seconds to minutes).
Aura (symptom);11;There are other neurological conditions which can cause aura-like symptoms.
Aura (symptom);12;These include strokes and panic attacks, for example.
Aura (symptom);13;Difficulty speaking   Vertigo: a kind of dizziness where the person feels as if the world is spinning or moving around them or there is a feeling of spinning or moving in their head.
Aura (symptom);14;Scotomas: blind spots in the person's vision   Scintillating scotomas, also called teichopsia: seeing bright wavy lines or a spot with flickering lights, which gets bigger and grows into one or more arcs or curves of shimmering white light or colored flickering lights.
Aura (symptom);15;Fortification: seeing zig-zag lines   Changes in vision   Photopsia: flashes of light   Tinnitus: a ringing noise in the ears   Muscle weakness   Bilateral facial pain: pain in both the left and right side of the face   Tingling feelings   Numbness: usually following the tingling sensation there is numbness (you can not feel very much or not at all) one side of the body.
Aura (symptom);16;This can happen in the arm, leg, and/or one side   Muscle weakness: usually on one side of the body   Alice in Wonderland Syndrome: these are a type of hallucination (something a person sees that is not real).
Aura (symptom);17;These types of hallucinations may make other people or things look much smaller than they really are (micropsia) or bigger than they really are (macropsia)   Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: skotos): a blind spot or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field.
Aura (symptom);19;: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is.
Aura (symptom);20;Scotomas may affect one or both eyes.
Aura (symptom);21;They can be either absolute, where the person can see nothing within the scotoma, or relative, where the person can see something within the scotoma, but less than usual.
Aura (symptom);22;:Negative scotoma: an area of partial or total blindness.
Aura (symptom);23;Usually it is followed by a scintillating scotoma, but the negative scotoma may be surrounded by a scintillating scotoma.
Aura (symptom);24;A negative scotoma may be either be an absolute scotoma and may seem like a blank spot where the person can not see any light, or a relative scotoma in which some light may be seen but less than normal, the scotoma may be blurry as if looking through thick plastic.
Aura (symptom);25;Negative scotomas are usually not noticed by a person and are found by an eye or ophthalmic examination.
Aura (symptom);26;:Positive scotoma: an area of vision loss or blockage that may be seen as a dark or black spot or the blockage of vision may be what seem to be various shapes or lines that may change in brightness i.e they may get darker and lighter so it seems like a flickering light.
Aura (symptom);27;::Fortification scotoma (AKA:teichopsia): seeing lines that look like the lines of a fort.
Aura (symptom);28;The lines may be gray or colored and the brightness may change from darker to lighter so that they appear to be flickering then the fortification scotoma may be called a scintillating scotoma.
Aura (symptom);29;::Scintillating scotoma: is the progression of a fortification scotoma i.e When the lines seen in a fortificatin scotoma change in brightness rapidly so they look like flickering lights.
Aura (symptom);30;This is one of the most common scotomas a person who has a migraine with aura may see.
Aura (symptom);31;It usually starts as a spot of flickering lights in the center of a person's visual field it then gets larger.
Bell's palsy;1;Bell's palsy is a paralysis of the face on one side.
Bell's palsy;2;It is caused by inflammation of a facial nerve.
Bell's palsy;3;The sufferer cannot move the muscles on the affected side of the face.
Bell's palsy;4;Several conditions can cause facial paralysis, such as brain tumors, strokes, and Lyme disease.
Bell's palsy;5;Bell's palsy is named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell.
Bell's palsy;6;Bell first described the disease.
Bell's palsy;7;It is the most common acute disease involving only one nerve, and it is the most common cause of sudden facial nerve paralysis.
Bell's palsy;8;Bell's palsy involves a rapid start of partial or complete paralysis that often occurs overnight.
Bell's palsy;9;Scientists believe that inflammation leads to swelling of the facial nerve.
Bell's palsy;10;The nerve travels through the skull in a narrow bone canal beneath the ear.
Bell's palsy;11;Nerve swelling and compression in the narrow bone canal are thought to stop the nerve from working.
Bell's palsy;12;At times of lowered immunity, a dormant (sleeping) virus, usually the chicken pox or cold sore virus, can wake up and attack the nerve causing it to swell.
Bell's palsy;13;The main symptoms of Bell's palsy are one-sided facial paralysis, jaw pain, dizziness, strengthened hearing in one ear, and weakened taste sense.
Bell's palsy;14;Bell's palsy usually cures itself, sometimes in a few weeks.
Bell's palsy;15;Corticosteroids (cortisone steroids) have been found to improve the condition while anti-viral drugs have not.
Bell's palsy;16;Early treatment is necessary for steroids or drugs to be effective, but it is controversial wether or not they work.
Bell's palsy;17;Most people recover spontaneously and achieve near-normal to normal functions.
Bell's palsy;18;Some people however will never regain full facial movement, or it may take a longer time.
Bell's palsy;19;Many show signs of improvement as early as 10 days after the onset, even without treatment.
Bell's palsy;20;Often those suffering from Bell's palsy cannot close the eye in the affected side.
Bell's palsy;21;The eye must be protected from drying up, or the cornea may be permanently damaged.
Bell's palsy;22;The affected eye may need to be taped shut when sleeping.
Staphylococcal infection;1;A staphylococcal infection (also called staph infection) is an infection caused by a Staphylococcus bacterium.
Staphylococcal infection;2;Staphylococcus can cause many different infections.
Staphylococcal infection;3;It can also cause food poisoning.
Staphylococcal infection;4;Staphylococcus aureus is a staphylococcus bacterium that can cause dangerous or even fatal diseases.
Staphylococcal infection;5;Because Staphylococcus aureus can live on dry surfaces, such as doorknobs or tables, for longer than most bacteria, someone can get sick from Staphylococcus aureus from touching one of those surfaces if someone with a staphylococcal infection has touched it even if there is nobody who has a staphylococcal infection near them.
Staphylococcal infection;6;Staphylococcus aureus can also cause toxic shock syndrome by releasing toxins into the bloodstream.
Staphylococcal infection;7;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is Staphylococcus aureus that is not cured by the antibiotic Methicillin or any other penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.
Staphylococcal infection;8;This is called antibiotic resistance.
Staphylococcal infection;9;Because penicillin and cephalosporin are the most important drugs that doctors use to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections, doctors may not be able to cure people with MRSA.
Staphylococcal infection;10;Type Description Example   Localised skin infections Small infections that usually aren't serious Abscesses, boils, and carbuncles   Diffuse skin infections Contagious skin infections that can be serious Impetigo   Deep localised infections Infections that are often very painful but do not spread to the blood Septicemia and necrotising pneumonia   Toxinoses Toxins in the bloodstream Gastroenteritis and toxic shock syndrome   Other Staphylococcus bacteria can cause infections, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
Staphylococcal infection;11;Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacterium that is normally on the skin.

Narcissistic personality disorder;3;It is more common in men than women.
Narcissistic personality disorder;4;It is named after Narcissus, a figure in Greek mythology who fell in love with his own reflection.
Narcissistic personality disorder;5;"In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, NPD is defined as "" habitual grandiosity (showing off), need for admiration and lack of empathy "" ."

Retinal migraine;1;Retinal migraine (also known as ophthalmic migraines, or ocular migraines) is a medical condition that affects the eyes by causing vision loss in one eye for less than 1 hour, usually for about 10–20 minutes.
Retinal migraine;2;When these retinal migraines happen they can also cause a headache, either a diffuse headache which is a headache that causes pain which is spread out and hurts a person's whole head, or, a unilateral headache, which is a headache that causes pain on one side of a persons head either, the left side or the right side.
Retinal migraine;3;It is believed retinal migraines are caused by vasospasms of the blood vessels of the eye in the area of the retina.
Retinal migraine;4;The retina is at the back of the inside of the eye.
Retinal migraine;5;In medicine a spasm is a sudden constriction or tightening of muscles that is involuntary - a person does not control them they move on their own.
Retinal migraine;6;Muscle spasms can happen in different muscles of the body, like when a person's leg or eye twitches.
Retinal migraine;7;The twitching is caused by the spasms.
Retinal migraine;8;Vaso- means something to do with the blood vessels, so a vasospasm causes the muscle cells inside the walls of a blood vessel to suddenly constrict or tighten up.
Retinal migraine;9;This causes the whole blood vessel to constrict which means makes the blood vessel narrower.
Retinal migraine;10;When a blood vessel constricts it is called vasoconstriction.
Retinal migraine;11;When vasoconstriction happens less blood the normal is able to flow through the blood vessel, like the way squeezing (constricting) a garden hose makes less water come out.
Retinal migraine;12;Vasoconstriction can happen for different reasons including because of a medical problem.
Retinal migraine;13;The second part of a vasospasm -vasodilation - occurs after the vasoconstriction.
Retinal migraine;14;After the blood vessel constricts it dilates - becomes bigger.
Retinal migraine;15;It may return to normal size or slightly larger than normal size.
Retinal migraine;16;The vasoconstriction and vasodilation complete one spasm.
Retinal migraine;17;Spasms often happen many times over and over again.
Retinal migraine;18;It is beleved that the muscle cells tigntening and loosenening may trigger the pain of a retinal migraine.
Vertigo;1;Vertigo: a person feels as if the world around them is spinning, or that they are spinning, or the spinning is in their head.
Vertigo;2;"Vertigo can be caused by different medical conditions; when it happens because of a migraine it is called migraine-associated vertigo."
Vertigo;3;It may happen before a migraine headache starts or during the headache, but vertigo is most common during the period of time between headaches.
Vertigo;4;Many people who have migraines have vertigo or dizziness as the main symptom instead of a headache.
Vertigo;5;"There are different way of vertigo associated with migraines, making a person feel; from feeling lightheaded or:   Episodic true vertigo:   Positional vertigo: which happens when a person holds their head in a certain positions."
Vertigo;6;Constant imbalance:   Movement associated dysequilibrium: different types of movement may cause vertigo.
Familial hemiplegic migraine;1;Familial hemiplegic migraine is a rare type of migraine headache with aura.
Familial hemiplegic migraine;2;It is an inherited medical disorder that causes paralysis on one side of the body.
Diverticulitis;1;Diverticulitis is a disease of the digestive system.
Diverticulitis;2;It is caused by inflammation of pouches (diverticula) in the walls of the bowel.
Diverticulitis;3;It usually occurs in the large intestine.
Diverticulitis;4;Diverticula can also be in the upper digestive tract at the level of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine.
Diverticulitis;5;Symptoms of diverticulitis depend on the extent of inflammation in the intestine.
Diverticulitis;6;Diverticulitis can be very painful.
Diverticulitis;7;The pain is usually present in the lower abdomen on the left side.
Diverticulitis;8;People with diverticulitis can also have nausea, vomiting, difficulty or pain while passing urine and changes in bowel habits.
Diverticulitis;9;One of the complications of diverticulitis can be the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity.
Diverticulitis;10;The inflammation or infection can then reach the abdominal wall and causes peritonitis.
Diverticulitis;11;This infection can also spread to other parts of the body such as organs near the intestine, causing sepsis, which is dangerous.
Diverticulitis;12;In addition, a fistula may form between the intestine and other organs.
Diverticulitis;13;Diverticulitis may also cause a blockage in the colon.
Diverticulitis;14;To prevent diverticulitis, it is important to be active and to have a diet rich in fibers.
Diverticulitis;15;These include eating (fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals).
Diverticulitis;16;It is also possible to reduce the risks of diverticulitis in several ways: chew foods before swallowing, defecate as soon as you feel the need, eat less fats and meats, do more physical activities, eat probiotics and drink water regularly.
Diverticulitis;17;To diagnose diverticulitis, it is important to do a barium enema X-ray to see the shape of the intestine wall.
Diverticulitis;18;Diverticula can be seen with a axial tomographie scan (CT scan).
Diverticulitis;19;It is also possible to prescribe an abdominal radiograph to indicate if there is a perforation.
Diverticulitis;20;After the acute phase or absence of acute diverticulitis, the doctor can prescribe a colonoscopy to look at the colon and determine the evolution of the disease.
Diverticulitis;21;The resection of the colon is the procedure most often used to treat severe diverticulitis.
Diverticulitis;22;It is also possible to do a resection of the diseased part of the colon and make a colostomy.
Diverticulitis;23;In fact, if a diverticulitis is too large, a colostomy could be necessary either temporarily or permanently.
Decompression sickness;1;Decompression sickness is caused by bubbles which form in the blood and other body parts of people who have the pressure around them decrease too quickly.
Decompression sickness;2;These bubbles may block the flow of blood and starve the body parts of oxygen, or the bubbles may cause damage by stretching, tearing, or pressing on the affected parts.
Decompression sickness;3;Decompression sickness is also called the bends.
Decompression sickness;4;Decompression sickness can happen to underwater divers who spend a lot of time in deep water, and return to the surface too quickly for the breathing gases dissolved in their bodies to escape without forming bubbles.
Decompression sickness;5;People can also get decompression sickness if they are in a pressurised aeroplane or spacecraft and it is damaged and the air is lost.
Decompression sickness;6;Decompression sickness can be prevented by decreasing the pressure slowly.
Decompression sickness;7;This allows the gases which have dissolved in the body to get out in the breathing air without forming bubbles.
Decompression sickness;8;Divers do this by coming up to the surface slowly, as the pressure depends on the depth, and reducing the depth will reduce the pressure.
Decompression sickness;9;For each ten metres change of depth the pressure will change by 1 bar, which is about the same as normal air pressure at sea level.
Decompression sickness;10;Divers find out how slowly to come up by using decompression tables or a dive computer.
Decompression sickness;11;They may need to stop on the way up to wait for enough gas to get out before it is safe to go up further.
Decompression sickness;12;This is called a decompression stop.
Decompression sickness;13;The tables or computer will inform the divers what depths they must stop at and how long they must stay at each depth.
Decompression sickness;14;People flying high in aircraft avoid decompression by being in a pressurized cabin.
Decompression sickness;15;In military aircraft the crew may breathe oxygen before the flight for a few hours so most of the nitrogen that is dissolved in their bodies can escape.
Decompression sickness;16;This is called oxygen prebreathing.
Decompression sickness;17;Astronauts preparing for a spacewalk also prebreathe oxygen and decompress inside the spacecraft before getting into their suit and going outside.
Decompression sickness;18;When a person breathes, the air or other breathing gas dissolves into the blood from the lungs.
Decompression sickness;19;This takes some time, and the amount of gas that can dissolve depends on the pressure around the person.
Decompression sickness;20;If the pressure is greater, more gas can dissolve.
Decompression sickness;21;After a while no more gas can dissolve at that pressure.
Decompression sickness;22;When a diver goes deeper, the pressure gets greater.
Decompression sickness;23;This makes more gas dissolve in the diver.
Decompression sickness;24;At the end of the dive the diver must return to the surface of the water where there is less pressure.
Decompression sickness;25;If the diver goes up slowly the pressure will change slowly, and there will be enough time for the gas dissolved in the diver to return from the blood to the breathing gas in the divers lungs and it will be safely removed.
Decompression sickness;26;If the pressure change is too quick for enough of the dissolved gas to be removed, the gas may form bubbles in the blood and other parts of the diver's body.
Decompression sickness;27;These bubbles will get bigger when the pressure gets less as the diver gets nearer to the surface.
Decompression sickness;28;Bubbles which are in the blood may get stuck in small blood vessels.
Decompression sickness;29;If this happens in the lungs they will usually do no great harm but if they block the blood flow in other parts of the body, the parts where the flow is blocked will not get enough oxygen and may be damaged.
Decompression sickness;30;This is very dangerous if it happens in the brain or heart.
Decompression sickness;31;The other place where bubbles may form is in the more solid parts of the body.
Decompression sickness;32;If these bubbles grow enough they may tear the parts around them or press against them hard enough to do damage.
Decompression sickness;33;If a diver gets decompression sickness it can be treated by putting the diver in a decompression chamber, and increasing the pressure to squeeze the bubbles to a smaller size where they do less harm, and by giving the diver pure oxygen to breathe, which helps to get the bubbles to dissolve again.
Decompression sickness;34;The oxygen also helps to stop more damage to the body by the bubbles which have blocked blood vessels, as there is more oxygen in the blood to keep the parts alive which have less blood supply because of the blockages.
Hashimoto's thyroiditis;1;Hashimato's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease.
Hashimoto's thyroiditis;2;The cause of Hashimato's thyroiditis is that body starts to produce antibodies against the normal thyroid tissue.

Weight loss;18;Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight.
Weight loss;19;Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight.
Weight loss;20;The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food.
Weight loss;21;Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits.
Weight loss;22;Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night.
Weight loss;23;One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide.
Weight loss;24;That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out.
Weight loss;25;A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon.
Weight loss;26;Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss.
Weight loss;27;Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Weight loss;28;It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat.
Weight loss;29;Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories.
Weight loss;30;Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss.
Weight loss;31;Several studies found similar results.
Weight loss;32;The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss.
Weight loss;33;The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.

Bipolar disorder in children;2;Identifying bipolar disorder for children and teenagers may be challenging-certain symptoms are very different from adults.
Bipolar disorder in children;3;Children and teens often have depressed moods mixed with mania taking place almost every day and sometimes at exactly the same time.
Bipolar disorder in children;4;Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is controversial, however.
Bipolar disorder in children;5;This condition often leads to impairments of daily function, and people with bipolar disorder which is prior to 18 years of age are far more likely to commit suicide.
Bipolar disorder in children;6;Pediatric bipolar disorder is far more acute in children and youth than in the adult population, with diagnoses at very early age.
Bipolar disorder in children;7;In children or teens, mania often has serious psychotic troubles with mixed mania and depression episodes which are worse and for more erratic times than in adults.
Bipolar disorder in children;8;Certain medications for this condition may have strong side effects for those under 18.
Bipolar disorder in children;9;Most bipolar children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Cyanosis;1;Cyanosis is a medical problem.
Cyanosis;2;When a person has cyanosis, their skin and mucous membranes turn blue or purple.
Cyanosis;3;Cyanosis is a sign that the cyanotic (blue) parts of the body are not getting enough blood and oxygen.
Cyanosis;4;This can happen because there is not enough oxygen in the blood.
Cyanosis;5;It can also happen when small blood vessels in the body get smaller because of a medical problem (this is called vasoconstriction).
Cyanosis;6;Usually cyanosis is first seen in the extremities (the parts of the body that are farthest away from the heart).
Cyanosis;7;Usually the first parts of the body to become cyanotic are the fingertips (especially under the fingernails), the toes, the lips, the tip of the nose, and the earlobes.
Cyanosis;8;As the body goes longer without oxygen, more of the body becomes cyanotic.

Diabetic retinopathy;1;Diabetic retinopathy, is the most common eye disease caused by diabetes, it damages the retinas in both eyes, causing vision problems which may lead to blindness.
Diabetic retinopathy;2;It affects up to 80 percent of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more.
Diabetic retinopathy;3;However it is possible that at least 90% of these new cases could be kept from becoming severe with early diagnosis and proper treatment.
Diabetic retinopathy;4;Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs.
Diabetic retinopathy;5;As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), they can bleed (ocular hemorrhage) and blur vision.
Diabetic retinopathy;6;The first time this happens, it may not be very severe.
Diabetic retinopathy;7;In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after a few hours.
Diabetic retinopathy;8;These spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood, which blurs vision.
Diabetic retinopathy;9;In extreme cases, a person will only be able to tell light from dark in that eye.
Diabetic retinopathy;10;It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear.
Diabetic retinopathy;11;These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep.
Diabetic retinopathy;12;On funduscopic exam, a doctor will see spots, flame hemorrhages, and dot-blot hemorrhages.
Diabetic retinopathy;13;Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens as a result of sorbitol (sugar alcohol) building up in the lens.
Diabetic retinopathy;14;This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness).
Diabetic retinopathy;15;A common sign of swelling of the lens is blurring of distance vision while near vision remains adequate.
Diabetic retinopathy;16;During the first three stages of diabetic retinopathy, no treatment is needed, unless there is macular edema.
Diabetic retinopathy;17;To prevent diabetic retinopathy from getting worse, diabetics should control their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol.
Diabetic retinopathy;18;Proliferative retinopathy is treated with scatter laser surgery, which helps to shrink the abnormal blood vessels.
Diabetic retinopathy;19;During the surgery 1,000 to 2,000 laser burns are placed in the areas of the retina away from the macula, causing the abnormal blood vessels to shrink.
Diabetic retinopathy;20;Two or more sessions usually are required to complete treatment.
Diabetic retinopathy;21;There may be some loss of peripheral (side) vision, and color vision, and night vision may also be slightly reduced.
Diabetic retinopathy;22;Scatter laser treatment works best before the abnormal fragile, new blood vessels which grow because of the disease have started to bleed.
Diabetic retinopathy;23;Treatment may still be possible after bleeding has begun in some cases.
Diabetic retinopathy;24;Macular edema is treated with focal laser treatment.
Diabetic retinopathy;25;Up to several hundred small laser burns are placed in the areas of retinal leakage surrounding the macula.
Diabetic retinopathy;26;These burns cauterize the blood vessels, reduces tha amount of leakage and fluid build-up in the retina.
Diabetic retinopathy;27;The surgery is usually done in one session but further treatments may be needed.
Diabetic retinopathy;28;If both eyes are affected by macular edema only one is treated at a time usually a few weeks apart.
Diabetic retinopathy;29;Focal laser treatment stabilizes vision and reduces the risk of vision loss by 50 percent.
Diabetic retinopathy;30;In a small number of cases, if vision is lost, it can be improved.
Diabetic retinopathy;31;Viteroctomy is the surgical removal of the vitreous humur.
Diabetic retinopathy;32;The vitreous humur is a clear, thick, gel-like fluid, that fills the inside of the eyeball and helps it to maintain its shape.
Diabetic retinopathy;33;This treatment is done in cases of proliferative retinopathy that causes severe scar tissue to form on the retina or when new blood vessels continue to grow on the retina after laser treatments.
Diabetic retinopathy;34;According to research done by the National Eye Institute, prompt treatment of diabetic macular edema with the drug Lucentis, with or without laser treatment, resulted in better vision than laser treatment alone, or steroid injections.
Diabetic retinopathy;35;When injected into the eye, Lucentis, and two other similar drugs, Avastin or Aylea, reduce fluid leakage and interfere with the growth of new blood vessels in the retina.

Histrionic personality disorder;1;Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is a cluster B personality disorder.
Histrionic personality disorder;2;The name is derived from Latin histrio, which is usually translated as actor.
Histrionic personality disorder;3;People with this condition constantly seek to direct attention to their own person.
Histrionic personality disorder;4;Very often they also flirt and try to seduce others in inappropriate ways to get this attention, for example by being exhibitionist.
Histrionic personality disorder;5;These attempts at seduction usually start when they are teenagers.
Histrionic personality disorder;6;Histrionics feel a strong need to receive a lot of appreciation, admiration and reassurance.
Histrionic personality disorder;7;HPD affects about four times as many women (4%) as men (1%).
Histrionic personality disorder;8;It has a prevalence of between two and three percent in the general population, and between ten and fifteen percent in mental health institutions.
Histrionic personality disorder;9;HPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders.
Histrionic personality disorder;10;People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation.
Histrionic personality disorder;11;They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others.
Histrionic personality disorder;12;Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.
Histrionic personality disorder;13;"A mnemonic that can be used to remember the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder is "" PRAISE ME "" :   Provocative (or seductive) behavior   Relationships are considered more intimate than they actually are   Attention-seeking   Influenced easily   Speech (style) wants to impress; lacks detail   Emotional lability; shallowness   Make-up; physical appearance is used to draw attention to self   Exaggerated emotions; theatrical   Most histrionics also have other mental disorders."
Histrionic personality disorder;14;HPD is comorbid (often occurs alongside): mood disorders, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other personality disorders - especially antisocial, borderline, narcissistic and dependent.

Dysthymia;10;However, even though both disorders have similar symptoms, these symptoms are usually less severe with dysthymia.
Dysthymia;11;Like with major depressive disorder, people with dysthymia may think about suicide or try to kill themselves.
Dysthymia;12;Dysthymia does not involve mania, hypomania (mild forms of mania), or mixed episodes (where a person has symptoms of both depression and mania).
Dysthymia;13;"Sometimes, people with dysthymia have "" double depression. """
Dysthymia;14;This happens when a person with dysthymia has episodes of major depression (where their depression gets much worse) on top of their existing dysthymia.
Dysthymia;15;Dysthymia usually affects adults, though it can affect teenagers.
Dysthymia;16;People who are diagnosed early (before age 22) usually have more severe relapses (where they return to being dysthymic after having been healthy), and are more likely to have other mental illnesses along with their dysthymia.
Fibromyalgia;1;Fibromyalgia is a condition with chronic pain.
Fibromyalgia;2;The exact causes are not known.
Fibromyalgia;3;However, symptoms are not totally restricted to the pain.
Fibromyalgia;4;There are also sleep disturbances, joint stiffness and severe fatigue.
Fibromyalgia;5;The problem sometimes exists along with depression, stress and anxiety.
Fibromyalgia;6;Fibromyalgia affects mostly women, though men can also be affected.
Fibromyalgia;7;Adults are usually the victims, although children may also be affected.
Erythema ab igne;1;Erythema ab igne is a rash of the skin, which is usually caused by the long-term exposure to heat or infrared radiation, and which is not a burn.
Erythema ab igne;2;Usually the name is abbreviated EAI.
Erythema ab igne;3;Other names include hot water bottle rash fire stains, laptop thigh, granny's tartan and toasted skin syndrome.
Erythema ab igne;4;Some people may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation.
Erythema ab igne;5;When a change in skin pigmentation can not be seen, it is often not noticed at all.
Intracranial aneurysm;1;Cerebral aneurysms, also called brain aneurysms, are a cerebrovascular issue in which weakness in the walls of a cerebral artery causes localized dilation or ballooning in the blood vessel.
Intracranial aneurysm;2;Small, unchanging aneurysms may produce very few symptoms.
Intracranial aneurysm;3;However, before a larger aneurysm ruptures, individuals may experience sudden or severe headaches, nausea, vomiting and vision problems.
Intracranial aneurysm;4;The rupture may also directly cause serious damage directly to the brain, usually from the bleeding itself-this is a hemorrhagic stroke that can lead to and may cause arm or leg weakness or paralysis and speech troubles.
Intracranial aneurysm;5;Cerebral aneurysms may result due to congenital defect, high blood pressure or head trauma.
Intracranial aneurysm;6;Onsets are sometimes sudden and without warning, and such ruptures are extremely dangerous and usually result in bleeding into the brain itself, leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which then constitutes a stroke.
Intracranial aneurysm;7;This condition may lead to death or permanent disability for some individuals.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;1;Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;2;This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder).
Abdominal compartment syndrome;3;This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;4;When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;5;An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;6;The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen.
Abdominal compartment syndrome;7;Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:   Primary or acute abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when injuries within the abdomen are responsible for the compartment syndrome   Secondary abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when there are no visible injury within the abdomen but injuries outside the abdomen cause fluid build-up inside the abdominal cavity   Chronic abdominal compartment syndrome occurs happens in association with diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver.
Blast injury;1;A blast injury is a wound caused by direct or indirect exposure to an explosive blast.
Blast injury;2;Physical blast injuries are divided into four categories, with a fifth for secondary illnesses caused by the blast, and a sixth category for the effects of associated post-blast psychological trauma such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Blast injury;3;The type and severity of injuries caused by an explosion depends on a variety of factors including type of explosion, force of the explosion, environment in which the explosion occurs, and how close to the explosion the person is.
Blast injury;4;An explosion results from the rapid release of energy.
Blast injury;5;Explosions fall into four general categories:   Chemical:   A chemical explosion is the result of a rapid chemical reaction or change of state which causes the creation of large amount of heat and usually gas.
Blast injury;6;There are various types of chemical explosions including natural gas explosions, dust explosions and those caused by explosives.
Blast injury;7;Explosives are categorized as high-order (HE) explosives or low-order (LE) explosives and they each cause different injury patterns.
Blast injury;8;Only (HE) explosives produces a shock wave   High-order explosives (HE) detonation causes the explosive material to change into a highly pressurized gas which travels at supersonic speeds creating a 'blast wave' (over-pressurization shock wave).
Blast injury;9;Examples of HE include TNT, C-4, Semtex, nitroglycerin, dynamite, and ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO).
Blast injury;10;Supersonic is when something travels at speeds that are faster than the speed of sound.
Blast injury;11;The speed of sound is about 768 miles per hour (1,236 kilometers per hour) at sea level.
Blast injury;12;Low-order explosives (LE) deflagrates or burns at a subsonic rate [below 3,300 feet per second], so it does not have HE’s over-pressurization supersonic schock wave.
Blast injury;13;Examples of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based bombs such as Molotov cocktails.
Blast injury;14;Mechanical   Electrical   Nuclear      Blast injuries are divided into four classes of physical trauma primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.
Blast injury;15;A fifth category, the quinary injuries, are those caused by toxic substances associated with the blast.
Blast injury;16;Primary injuries are caused by the explosion's shock waves.
Blast injury;17;Air and fluid-filled internal organs are most commonly affected, but the blast wave may also cause external injuries such as traumatic amputation.
Blast injury;18;The structures of the internal ears are most often affected by the blast wave, with perforated ear drums the most common injury.
Blast injury;19;The most common fatal injury in victims who survive the initial blast is blast lung.
Blast injury;20;Blast lung can result in pulmonary contusions, bleeding and fluid build-up in the lungs with damage to airways and blood vessels.
Blast injury;21;Most casualties in an explosion are caused by secondary blast injuries.
Blast injury;22;These injuries may be caused by fragments of the explosive device and other objects within the blast zone being propelled by the force of the explosion.
Blast injury;23;These objects may strike any part of the body resulting in penetrating trauma.
Blast injury;24;The severity of the penetrating trauma depends to a degree on the size of the object, the depth of penetration, and the part of the body hit.
Blast injury;25;Secondary blast injuries are common in deliberate explosions such as those caused by terrorist bombs.
Blast injury;26;The bombs are often designed with objects such as nails, or ball bearings packed in and around the explosive device to act as shrapnel.
Blast injury;27;These injuries may also occur in accidental explosions - such as may occur in an industrial accident - when objects in the environment affected by the blast, such as shattered glass take the role of shrapnel.
Blast injury;28;Displacement of air by the explosion creates a blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects.
Blast injury;29;Injuries resulting from this type of traumatic impact are referred to as tertiary blast injuries.
Blast injury;30;Tertiary injuries may present as some combination of blunt and penetrating trauma, including bone fractures and coup contre-coup injuries.
Blast injury;31;Young children, because they weigh less than adults, are at particular risk of tertiary injury.
Blast injury;32;Quaternary injuries, include flash burns, crush injuries from falling debris and inhalation injuries, which may make existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD worse.
Blast injury;33;This category of blast injury has been added fairly recently to classify injuries, which often results in a hyperinflammatory state may due to exposure to the environmental contaminants associated with the various types of explosive blasts including, bacteria, chemicals and radiation (dirty bombs) as well as adverse tissue reaction to fuel and metals in the blast.
Blast injury;34;The psychological trauma which may occur in explosive blast survivors includes post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Blast injury;35;A concussion sustained in a blast may also be a risk factor for developing PTSD independent of a person's psychological reaction to the witnessed event.
Blast injury;36;Psychological trauma may also occur in the complete absence of physical injuries.
Blast injury;37;Tertiary blast injury    		        Neurotrauma can occur due to the mechanisms of one or more blast injury categories.
Blast injury;38;Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain.
Blast injury;39;Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, reducing the amount of the oxygen delivered to the brain.
Blast injury;40;Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function.
Blast injury;41;Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue and/or organs also significantly contributes to blast-induced neurotrauma.
Blast injury;42;Individuals exposed to blasts frequently have loss of memory for events before and after explosion, confusion, headache, impaired sense of reality, and reduced decision-making ability.
Blast injury;43;Patients with brain injuries acquired in explosions often develop sudden, unexpected brain swelling and cerebral vasospasm despite continuous monitoring.
Blast injury;44;However, the first symptoms of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) may occur months or even years after the initial event, and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries.
Blast injury;45;The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss, hormone imbalance, chronic fatigue, headache, and problems in memory, speech and balance.
Blast injury;46;These changes are often debilitating, interfering with daily activities.
Blast injury;47;Because BINT in blast victims is underestimated, valuable time is often lost for preventive therapy and/or timely rehabilitation.
Blast injury;48;Conventional Warfare: Ballistic, Blast and Burn Injuries
Major depressive disorder;1;REDIRECT Depression (mental illness)
Amblyopia;1;Amblyopia, more commonly called lazy eye, is a condition that affects the eye.
Amblyopia;2;In this condition, a nerve pathway leading from one eye to the brain does not develop correctly, leading to poor vision.
Amblyopia;3;As a result, blurred images are sent to the brain.
Rosacea;1;Rosacea is a chronic facial condition that is characterized through acne and redness.
Rosacea;2;It can happen to people of any age.
Rosacea;3;It gets worse if left untreated.
Rosacea;4;There are four types of rosacea, three involving human skin and the fourth affecting eyes.
Rosacea;5;Rosacea affects mostly Caucasians, though some other races can be affected.
Rosacea;6;Rosacea affects both males and females.
Rosacea;7;Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea.
Rosacea;8;Things that can cause rosacea are exposure of the face to extreme temperature, the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, alcohol and spicy foods.
Rosacea;9;Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated.
Pimple;1;Pimples (also called zits) are a type of acne.
Pimple;2;They are caused by oil getting trapped in the pores of the skin.
Pimple;3;Pimples often happen during adolescence or puberty.
Pimple;4;Practicing good hygiene is essential, but even that might not prevent all pimples.
Guillain–Barré syndrome;1;Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), sometimes Landry's paralysis or Guillain–Barré–Strohl syndrome is a syndrome that causes weakness of the feet and hands.
Guillain–Barré syndrome;2;Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at 1–2 cases per 100,000 people annually, but is the most common cause of acute non-trauma-related paralysis.
Guillain–Barré syndrome;3;The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it in 1916.
Oral cancer;1;Oral cancer is cancer of any part of the mouth.
Oral cancer;2;It can start in the mouth, lips, or the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth).
Oral cancer;3;A person can get oral cancer without having any other type of cancer.
Oral cancer;4;However, oral cancer can also happen because of metastasis.
Oral cancer;5;This means that the person had cancer in some other part of their body, and it spread to the mouth.
Oral cancer;6;The person's cancer may be far away from the mouth, or it may be in a part of the body that neighbors the mouth.
Oral cancer;7;For example, if a person has cancer of the nasal cavity, the cancer can spread to the mouth.
Oral cancer;8;There are a few different types of oral cancers.
Oral cancer;9;But about 90% (9 in every 10 cases) are a type called squamous cell carcinomas.
Oral cancer;10;Squamous cells make up the main part of the outer layer of the skin.
Oral cancer;11;These cells line the lips, mouth, and throat.
Oral cancer;12;"A "" carcinoma "" is a type of cancer that can start in these cells in the skin."
Oral cancer;13;Squamous cell carcinomas most often start in the tongue.
Oral cancer;14;"But they can also start in any other part of the mouth, including the floor of the mouth (under the tongue); the inside lining of the cheek; the gums; the lips; or the palate (the roof of the mouth)."
Oral cancer;15;Other oral cancers include:   Adenocarcinoma, which starts in a salivary gland   Lymphoma, which can start in the tonsils   Melanoma, which can start from cells in the mucus membrane that lines the inside of the mouth
Restless legs syndrome;1;Restless legs syndrome is a serious neurological disorder.
Restless legs syndrome;2;It involves an irresistible urge to move certain regions of the human body to stop odd or uncomfortable sensation.
Restless legs syndrome;3;This condition often involves the legs, torso, the head or the arms.
Restless legs syndrome;4;Moving an affected part of the body modulates sensations, which may provide temporary relief.
Restless legs syndrome;5;Around 75% of people who have RLS have problems involving iron.
Restless legs syndrome;6;Other possible issues include varicose veins, sleep troubles, conditions involving blood sugar, ADHD or fibromyalgia.
Premenstrual syndrome;1;Premenstrual syndrome is a collection of emotional symptoms and conditions, with or without conditions that are physical.
Premenstrual syndrome;2;To actually declare PMS, certain emotional symptoms are present, the most common of which include stress, anxiety, problems falling asleep (insomnia) and mood issues.
Premenstrual syndrome;3;The condition affects many females.
Anterograde amnesia;1;Anterograde amnesia is a kind of amnesia.
Anterograde amnesia;2;Amnesia is a problem with remembering things.
Anterograde amnesia;3;In anterograde amnesia, people have trouble making memories last - they forget.
Anterograde amnesia;4;"Amnesia is triggered by an event; people with anterograde amnesia have problems creating new memories after that event."
Anterograde amnesia;5;With Anterograde amnesia, the longer-term memories from the time before the event remain intact.
Anterograde amnesia;6;The amnesia may be partial or complete.
Anterograde amnesia;7;Very often Anterograde amnesia occurs together with retrograde amnesia.
Anterograde amnesia;8;This is the case with conditions such as concussion.
Anterograde amnesia;9;There are different other conditions which can also lead to anterograde amnesia.
Anterograde amnesia;10;They include:   Certain drugs: For example, Benzodiazepines   injuries of the brain, most commonly traumatic brain injury   Certain diseases, for example a kind of encephalitis, caused by the Herpes simplex virus.
Anterograde amnesia;11;Being drunk can cause Anterograde amnesia.
Anosmia;1;Anosmia is losing the the sense of smell.
Anosmia;2;The word is also used for people who never had this sense.
Anosmia;3;The loss can be temporary, or permanent.
Anosmia;4;The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include:   Upper respiratory tract infection, for example a common cold   Blocking the nose, for example through seasonal allergies, or a nasal polyp.
Anosmia;5;Side-effects of certain drugs or of certain poisons.
Anosmia;6;Concussion, brain tumors.
Anosmia;7;Smelling things depends on two nerves (Nervus olfactorius and Nervus trigeminus), as well as the part of the brain which processes the information.
Anosmia;8;"Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small."
Anosmia;9;There are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem.
Anosmia;10;The sense of smell also affects the sense of taste.
Anosmia;11;People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.
Anosmia;12;Note also that the sense of smell changes with age.
Anosmia;13;Anosmia can also point to different neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease,   Alzheimer's disease, or Schizophrenia.
Anosmia;14;Certain plants, such as tobacco also contain substances which change olfaction.
Anosmia;15;In general, anosmia which has its cause in the brain cannot be treated.
Anosmia;16;Anosmia which is caused by blocking the nose can be treated by removing the block.
Anosmia;17;In some cases, accupuncture was successfully used to treat anosmia.
Aseptic meningitis;1;Meningitis happens when the brain's lining becomes inflamed.
Aseptic meningitis;2;This lining is called the meninges.
Aseptic meningitis;3;Aseptic meningitis occurs when there are signs of meningitis.
Aseptic meningitis;4;However, when a sample of brain fluid is taken, bacteria do not grow.
Aseptic meningitis;5;This condition is often treatable.
Aseptic meningitis;6;In many cases, recovery takes 7–10 days.
Aseptic meningitis;7;"Viral infection due to:   Enterovirus (e.g., Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease; Conjunctivitis)   Sexually transmitted disease (e.g., herpes, Syphilis, HIV and AIDS)   Other viruses, such as West Nile Virus   Parasitic infection (e.g., Lyme Disease)   Mycoplasma (a type of pneumonia)   Tuberculosis   Fungal infection   Bacterial Meningitis that has not been fully treated   Certain drugs   Autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sarcoidosis, Behcet's Disease)   These factors increase the chance of developing aseptic meningitis:   Being exposed to someone with a viral illness   Working in a daycare or healthcare setting   Having a compromised immune system   Taking certain drugs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)   Being a child or teenager (affects children and teens more often than adults)"
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;1;Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (which is also known as B-cell and T-cell lymphomas) is a cancer of the lymphatic system.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;2;The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;3;It is also part of the immune system.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;4;Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;5;In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;6;A lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands).
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;7;The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;8;The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma;9;The usual way to know that a person has non-Hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy (testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue).
Prader–Willi syndrome;1;Prader–Willi syndrome is a rare but major genetic condition that involves being overweight, substandard sexual development and low intelligence.
Prader–Willi syndrome;2;This problem also puts those affected under risk for diabetes mellitus.
Prader–Willi syndrome;3;People with Prader-Willi syndrome experience constant hunger, despite eating much more than average, which can cause life-threatening obesity.
Prader–Willi syndrome;4;It was first observed in 1956.
Prader–Willi syndrome;5;Prader-Willi syndrome is usually diagnosed with a genetic test.
Prader–Willi syndrome;6;There is no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome.
Prader–Willi syndrome;7;It can be treated with behavioural therapy.
Delusional disorder;1;The term delusional disorder refers to an uncommon although serious condition in which patients have non-bizarre delusions.
Delusional disorder;2;These patients function in normal manners.
Delusional disorder;3;Their delusions are not caused from drugs or general disorders.
Delusional disorder;4;Examples of these delusions include being followed, spied on or being poisoned, having certain health problems, such as heart disease or stroke.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;1;Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is a sexual condition that is characterized by the lack of sexual fantasy and desire for sexual activity.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;2;For this to be judged as a disorder, the condition has to cause strong distress or interpersonal troubles, and should not be better accounted for by another mental disorder or drugs.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;3;The condition was first discovered around the late 1960s or early 1970s.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;4;The subtypes include women or men earlier having sexual interests for their partner, though that interest has since cooled down or faded away.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;5;In some cases, sexual partners, female or male, may have never had sexual desire to begin with.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;6;The condition may be triggered through other health problems.
Anxiety disorder;1;The term anxiety disorder is a term for a number of psychiatric disorders.
Anxiety disorder;2;These disorders can be classified into two very broad groups:   #Disorders that are marked by extreme worry about the past, present or future.
Anxiety disorder;3;#Disorders that are marked by fear of a given object or situation.
Anxiety disorder;4;Anxiety conditions include phobia, social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.
Anxiety disorder;5;Other anxiety disorders include agoraphobia and panic disorder.
Anxiety disorder;6;Stress from life events, including past abuse, being intimidated or health worries, can trigger anxiety problems for many people.
Anxiety disorder;7;Symptoms include headache, spasms in the muscle, trembling, fatigue and exhaustion.
Anxiety disorder;8;There are various manners for treating anxiety disorders.
Anxiety disorder;9;These include medication and therapy.
Anxiety disorder;10;There is some recent research.
Schizoid personality disorder;1;Schizoid personality disorder is a Cluster A personality disorder which involves not being interested in social relationships, tendency toward a solitary lifestyle, being secretive and being emotionally cold.
Schizoid personality disorder;2;This condition is by no means the same as schizophrenia.
Schizoid personality disorder;3;People with SzPD will typically share some of the negative symptoms and characteristics of schizophrenia, such as blunted affect or detachment.
Schizoid personality disorder;4;However, schizoids do not have the positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations.
Schizoid personality disorder;5;People who have SzPD do not want interpersonal relationships which require emotion and commitment.
Schizoid personality disorder;6;People with SzPD are introverts who feel the need to be independent or alone.
Schizoid personality disorder;7;Many schizoids are asexual or have little interest in sexual encounters.
Schizoid personality disorder;8;Any relationships they may have likely do not involve emotional attachment.
Schizoid personality disorder;9;SzPD is more common in men than women.
Schizoid personality disorder;10;Some of the negative symptoms of the disorder (such as low energy) may be treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs.
Schizoid personality disorder;11;Theodore Millon said that there are four types of schizoid: languid, remote, depersonalized, and affectless.
Tardive dyskinesia;1;Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious neurological illness.
Tardive dyskinesia;2;"It is a type of dyskinesia - a disorder that causes movements that happen over and over again, which a person cannot control. """
Tardive dyskinesia;3;"Tardive "" means these movements do not start right away, or they start slowly."
Tardive dyskinesia;4;Tardive dyskinesia is usually caused by taking antipsychotic medicines in high doses, or for a long time.
Tardive dyskinesia;5;This happens more often with older antipsychotic medicines.
Tardive dyskinesia;6;Usually, tardive dyskinesia happens when these medicines are taken for many months or years.
Tardive dyskinesia;7;But some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking these medicines for only 6 weeks.
Tardive dyskinesia;8;The medicines that are most likely to cause tardive dyskinesia are these older antipsychotic medicines:   Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)   Fluphenazine (Prolixin)   Haloperidol (Haldol)   Trifluoperazine   Other medicines that are similar to these antipsychotics can also cause tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesia;9;These medicines are used to treat gastrointestinal problems, like nausea, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying (when the stomach does not empty as quickly as normal).
Tardive dyskinesia;10;"If they are taken for a long time, they can cause tardive dyskinesia:   Metoclopramide (Reglan)   Prochlorperazine (Compazine)   Newer antipsychotic medicines (also called "" atypical antipsychotics "" ) are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia, but they still can."
Tardive dyskinesia;11;Nobody knows why some people get tardive dyskinesia after taking antipsychotic medicines while others do not.
Tardive dyskinesia;12;But there are certain groups of people who are more likely to get tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesia;13;The longer a person has been on antipsychotic medicines, the more likely they are to get TD.
Tardive dyskinesia;14;Most people who get tardive dyskinesia are people who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and have been on antipsychotic medicines for a long time.
Tardive dyskinesia;15;But some other people can get tardive dyskinesia too.
Tardive dyskinesia;16;Some people have a very high risk of getting tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesia;17;They can get TD even after taking an antipsychotic medicine just once.
Tardive dyskinesia;18;People that have this very high risk include:   People with fetal alcohol syndrome   People with other developmental disabilities   People with brain diseases or injuries   The symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are movements of the face, lips, tongue, torso, arms, and legs.
Tardive dyskinesia;19;The person with tardive dyskinesia cannot stop or control these movements.
Tardive dyskinesia;20;For example, people with tardive dyskinesia often cannot stop themselves from:   Smacking their lips   Pushing their tongue out   Swinging their jaw   Moving their mouth like they are chewing or sucking   Moving their fingers, arms, or legs   Often, people with tardive dyskinesia also have akathisia.
Tardive dyskinesia;21;This is a constant urge to move, or always being restless.
Tardive dyskinesia;22;Doctors can try to prevent tardive dyskinesia by:   Using the lowest possible dose of antipsychotic medicine   Using antipsychotic medicine for the shortest possible time   Using newer (atypical) antipsychotic medicines instead of older antipsychotics which are more likely to cause TD   Checking for symptoms of TD at every appointment with the patient   Diagnosing tardive dyskinesia early is very important.
Tardive dyskinesia;23;Sometimes, if the drug that is causing TD is stopped early enough, the tardive dyskinesia will go away.
Tardive dyskinesia;24;This is more likely to happen if the TD is diagnosed soon after its symptoms start.
Tardive dyskinesia;25;Sometimes, even if the medication is stopped, the tardive dyskinesia never goes away.
Tardive dyskinesia;26;If a person with TD still needs antipsychotic medicines, a medication called clozapine (Clozaril) is the best choice.
Tardive dyskinesia;27;It is a newer antipsychotic, it often works well for schizophrenia that is hard to treat, and it has less of a risk of causing or worsening TD.
Tardive dyskinesia;28;The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any medicines to treat the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesia;29;Some doctors use these medications:   Benzodiazepines, especially clonazepam (Klonopin)   Clonidine (Catapres), a medication used for blood pressure and many other things   Medicines given for Parkinson's disease, like pramipexole (Mirapex) and baclofen   Some small experiments have said that these medicines may be helpful for TD symptoms:   Ondansetron (Zofran), a medicine for nausea and vomiting   Vitamin E   Levodopa (L-DOPA), an old medicine used for Parkinson's disease   Propranolol, a blood pressure medicine that can also be used for tremors   Zonisamide (Zonegran), an anti-seizure medication   Botulinum toxin (Botox)
Cirrhosis;1;Cirrhosis is a disease of the liver.
Cirrhosis;2;Normal liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue.
Cirrhosis;3;The liver does not work so well.
Cirrhosis;4;Cirrhosis is caused mostly by alcoholism, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Ascites (retention of fluid in the abdomen) is the most common complication for cirrhosis.
Cirrhosis;5;The patient's skin develops a yellowish hue (jaundice) as the disease gets worse.
Cirrhosis;6;Liver damage by cirrhosis cannot be repaired.
Cirrhosis;7;It leads to a poor quality of life, and can cause death.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;1;Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a disease of the skin.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;2;In most cases, it is caused by an allergic reaction to drugs.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;3;This accounts for about half the cases.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;4;Lymphoma, and other infections are responsible for most other cases.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;5;The disease is characterized by cell death that causes the epidermis to separate from the dermis.
Stevens–Johnson syndrome;6;Since this is similar to what happens in burn, some of the same methods are used to treat patients.
Nitrogen narcosis;1;Nitrogen narcosis is a problem for underwater divers.
Nitrogen narcosis;2;It affects the brain and nervous system a lot like alcohol, but goes away when the diver rises to a shallower depth.
Nitrogen narcosis;3;It does not have lasting effects after the depth is reduced.
Nitrogen narcosis;4;Any underwater diver who goes deeper than 30 m (100 ft)while breathing air, or any time when the pressure of nitrogen in the breathing gas is more than about 3,2 bar.
Nitrogen narcosis;5;It only happens when the pressure of nitrogen is high.
Nitrogen narcosis;6;If the pressure is kept low by staying at a shallower depth it will not happen.
Nitrogen narcosis;7;If the breathing gas has less nitrogen it will only start at a deeper depth.
Nitrogen narcosis;8;Helium gas can be used in place of nitrogen in breathing gas for divers to make it less likely to have nitrogen narcosis.
Nitrogen narcosis;9;The nitrogen gas dissolved in the diver affects the working of nerve cells.
Nitrogen narcosis;10;At higher pressures more nitrogen can be dissolved.
Nitrogen narcosis;11;It starts off as a mild effect like being slightly drunk, but as the pressure increases it gets more serious, like getting more drunk.
Nitrogen narcosis;12;Eventually the diver may lose consciousness.
Nitrogen narcosis;13;A diver who has nitrogen narcosis will have slower reactions and may not think clearly.
Nitrogen narcosis;14;If something goes wrong the diver may not be able to cope with the problem.
Nitrogen narcosis;15;This can be dangerous.
Nitrogen narcosis;16;The diver can move to a shallower depth or change to a different breathing gas with less nitrogen.
Nitrogen narcosis;17;This will usually be a mixture containing helium.
Vaginal bleeding;1;Vaginal bleeding is any bleeding through the human vagina.
Vaginal bleeding;2;That includes bleeding from either the vaginal wall itself or, more commonly, other areas of the female reproductive system.
Vaginal bleeding;3;Vaginal bleeding may happen at any age, although it always needs investigation if encountered in girls or women after menopause.
Vaginal bleeding;4;If the condition happens in pregnancy, that could indicate a medical need which should be addressed.

Trance;1;Trance describes a state of mind.
Trance;2;A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her.
Trance;3;The term trance is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, religion, and certain kinds of music.
Trance;4;"It is an "" altered state of consciousness "" ."
Trance;5;There are many efforts to define what a trance is.
Trance;6;Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality   The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance.
Trance;7;Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information.
Trance;8;Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts.
Trance;9;Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies.
Trance;10;This is entirely normal.
Trance;11;"In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called "" dissociation "" ."
Trance;12;Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream.
Trance;13;There are many examples of trance in religion.
Trance;14;African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits.
Trance;15;Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time.
Trance;16;During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped.
Trance;17;"States of "" spiritual ecstasy "" are known in most forms of Christian worship."
Trance;18;"It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as "" mysticism "" ."

Dependent personality disorder;1;A dependent personality disorder (DPD) is a personality disorder that involves a psychological dependence on other people.
Dependent personality disorder;2;This personality disorder is a long-term (chronic) condition in which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs.
Dependent personality disorder;3;Only a small percentage of people with dependent personality disorders are eventually able to manage on their own.
Fugue state;1;A fugue state (dissociative fugue or psychogenic fugue) is a rare psychiatric disorder.
Fugue state;2;It involves temporary loss of memory (amnesia).
Fugue state;3;It usually only lasts a short time (from hours to days), but can last months or longer.
Fugue state;4;In a fugue state, the person not only forgets all about who they are, but may suddenly adopt a new identity.
Fugue state;5;They may leave home and wander, settle in another area with a new name.
Fugue state;6;Fugue occurs to avoid stress and anxiety.
Fugue state;7;"After the fugue state comes to an end, the person recovers the memories they lost, but usually forgets all that happened during the fugue.   """

Steatorrhea;1;Steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces.
Steatorrhea;2;In this case, the feces is often lighter, sometimes whitish, in color.
Steatorrhea;3;It produces a fouler-than-usual, sour-rancid smell, and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Steatorrhea;4;Steatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet.
Steatorrhea;5;It may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes, such as those usually produced by the body, which digest fat.
Steatorrhea;6;Research should be done, and a doctor consulted if necessary, to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat.
Steatorrhea;7;The causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting, so simply treating symptoms may not be enough.
Encopresis;1;Encopresis is the voluntary or involuntary passage of feces in a child who has been toilet trained (typically over age 4), which causes the soiling of clothes.
Paraplegia;1;Paraplegia is paralysis of the legs and lower half of the body.
Paraplegia;2;It happens when the spinal cord is damaged.
Paraplegia;3;Sometimes, they are kept alive by a life-support machine.
Paraplegia;4;It sometimes happens to people because they get a disease.
Paraplegia;5;Superior paraplegia is a type of paraplegia where people cannot use their arms and the top of their body.
Paraplegia;6;A person who has paraplegia is sometimes called a paraplegic.
Arthus reaction;1;In immunology, the Arthus reaction is a kind of local allergic reaction, when antibodies react to a chemical or protein in a person's blood, and have the antibodies get stuck in the walls of blood vessels in organs such as the heart, in joints, and kidneys.
Arthus reaction;2;The Arthus reaction was discovered by Nicolas Maurice Arthus in 1903.
Arthus reaction;3;Arthus repeatedly injected ingredients of horse blood under the skin of rabbits.
Arthus reaction;4;After four injections, he found that there was swelling and that the mixture was absorbed slowly.
Arthus reaction;5;Further injections eventually led to dying of cells.
Arthus reaction;6;Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccinations.
Arthus reaction;7;They are rare and can cause pain, swelling, bleeding, and occasionally death of tissue within 4–12 hours after the vaccine is given.

Psychological abuse;1;Psychological abuse may also be called psychological violence, emotional abuse or mental abuse.
Psychological abuse;2;It is when a person puts another person under abuse which may result in psychological trauma.
Psychological abuse;3;The abuse may result in anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
Psychological abuse;4;This kind of behaviour is an extreme kind of bullying.
Psychological abuse;5;This abuse happens most often when one person has power over another.
Psychological abuse;6;It may result in narcissism, depression, anxiety, and other disorders.
Psychological abuse;7;The term does not mean physical abuse.
Psychological abuse;8;The most common thing to happen is verbal abuse.
Psychological abuse;9;Blaming, shaming, and name calling are signs of verbal abuse which can affect a victim emotionally.
Substance abuse;1;Substance abuse, or drug abuse, happens when a person uses a drug over and over again, in ways that hurt their health.
Substance abuse;2;The person is using the drug to change their mood or to feel better, not for any healthy reason.
Substance abuse;3;Sometimes when the person uses the drug for a long time, they will start to act differently.
Substance abuse;4;Some of the drugs are illegal to have or use, or can have certain limits that the person does not follow.
Substance abuse;5;Someone who thinks that they need a drug is called an addict.
Substance abuse;6;Substance abuse can have different symptoms in different people.
Substance abuse;7;“Drug abuse” is not used in the DSM or ICD.
Substance abuse;8;In the DSM, the term “substance abuse” is used instead to mean the misuse of one of ten different types of drugs.
Substance abuse;9;A person can also become dependent on drugs.
Substance abuse;10;Repetitive use of a drug can cause dependence as well as tolerance.
Substance abuse;11;Tolerance happens when it takes more of a drug to produce the same effect than a previous time.
Substance abuse;12;The term “drug misuse” is sometimes used when the drug being used is a prescription medication that are classified as sedatives (medicines that make someone calm), anxiolytics (medicines that make someone less worried or anxious), analgesics (medicines that reduce pain), or stimulants (medicines that give someone more energy).
Substance abuse;13;Someone who abuses there drugs may have to illegally buy them from someone who gets them from a doctor.
Substance abuse;14;Not everyone agrees on the definition of substance abuse.
Substance abuse;15;Different countries have different rules for what is a drug and what drugs are illegal.
Substance abuse;16;People also do not agree about what is abuse.
Substance abuse;17;In most Western countries, one glass of wine is acceptable, but drinking more than one bottle at once is abuse.
Substance abuse;18;To some people, any drinking can be seen as abuse.
Substance abuse;19;In the United States, any use of marijuana   In many cases, when a person is using drugs, their thinking and behaviors change.
Substance abuse;20;Sometimes, they commit crimes while using drugs.
Substance abuse;21;They may do things that are not safe, like drive a car while drunk.
Substance abuse;22;When people abuse drugs over a longer time, their personalities often change as well.
Substance abuse;23;The people who abuse drugs are often addicted.
Substance abuse;24;Since many of these drugs are illegal, very often drug users have problems with the law.
Substance abuse;25;There are two major ideas about why people abuse drugs.
Substance abuse;26;Many people believe that both can be true for different cases or with different people, which is one reason why different treatments work better or worse for different people.
Substance abuse;27;One idea about why people use drugs is because of their genes.
Substance abuse;28;When a person's parents or grandparents have been addicted to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes or even coffee, the same genes that made them become addicted could be passed down to any of their children.
Substance abuse;29;When someone is born with the genes that increase addiction, it causes their brain and body to become dependent on drugs very quickly.
Substance abuse;30;But even if a person's genes make it easier for them to become addicted to drugs, that person still need to try a drug first, before they can become addicted on it.
Substance abuse;31;This idea also means that different people can have harder or easier time stopping drugs after they are already addicted.
Substance abuse;32;The second major idea is that drug use is a habit that becomes harmful.
Substance abuse;33;It is always very hard to stop bad habits, but in this idea, drugs are one of the strongest bad habits because drugs cause so many changes in the brain.
Substance abuse;34;Each time a person uses drugs, the parts of the brain that think about drugs become stronger and stronger.
Substance abuse;35;In this idea, if a person likes drugs, that person starts to plan their day around using drugs.
Substance abuse;36;To stop a habit as strong as drug use, many other things about that person's life must also change.
Substance abuse;37;This idea also means that, the longer a person takes drugs, the harder it is for them to stop taking drugs.
Substance abuse;38;"People abuse drugs in many different ways, including:   Taking illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine)   Using legal medicines to feel good, not for what they are supposed to treat (for example, taking oxycodone to feel very good, not as a painkiller)   Taking too much of a drug on purpose (for example, taking more than a normal amount of oxycodone because it will make the euphoria from the drug even better)   Some of the most commonly abused illegal drugs are:   Cocaine, including crack cocaine   Heroin   Marijuana   MDMA (also called Ecstasy or Molly)   Methamphetamine (also called meth), including crystal methamphetamine   Synthetic cannabinoids (a man-made drug that includes the main chemical in marijuana; also called K2 or Spice)   Some of the most commonly abused legal drugs and medicines are:   Alcohol   Nicotine (the drug in cigarettes)   Over-the-counter cough and cold medicines that include dextrometorphan (DMX)   Prescription opioids (strong painkillers), like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone   Prescription sedatives (drugs that make people feel relaxed or sleepy), like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and sleep medicines   Prescription stimulants (drugs that make people feel more awake and have more energy), like medicines used for ADHD   People who abuse drugs have a high rate of suicide."
Substance abuse;39;This is because of the changes in the brain caused by drugs, both when they are being used and the changes they cause over time.
Substance abuse;40;Another cause is the loss of family and friends because of the drug abuse.
Substance abuse;41;In the United States, about 30% of all people who perform suicide have abused alcohol at some point.
Substance abuse;42;This table explains more about how some commonly abused drugs relate to depression and suicide:   Substance abused   Effects related to suicide   Alcohol   People who misuse alcohol are more likely to have a number of mental health disorders.
Substance abuse;43;Alcoholics have a very high suicide rate.
Substance abuse;44;Suicide from alcoholism is more common in older adults.
Substance abuse;45;If a person drinks 6 or more drinks per day, they are six times more likely to commit suicide.
Substance abuse;46;Many heavy drinkers have major depressive disorder, and heavy drinking itself can cause major depressive disorder in a lot of alcoholics.
Substance abuse;47;Benzodiazepines   People are more likely to be depressed, and have a higher risk of suicide, if they have been abusing benzodiazepines (like Xanax) or using them for a long time.
Substance abuse;48;Depressed adolescents who were taking benzodiazepines were much more likely to hurt themselves or kill themselves.
Substance abuse;49;Cigarette smoking   Many studies have shown a link between smoking, thinking about suicide, and suicide attempts.
Substance abuse;50;In studies done with 50,000 nurses and 300,000 male U.S. Army soldiers, the people who smoked between 1 to 24 cigarettes per day had twice the suicide risk, and people who smoked 25 cigarettes or more had 4 times the suicide risk, as compared with those who had never smoked.
Substance abuse;51;Cocaine   Misuse of drugs such as cocaine often has a link with suicide.
Substance abuse;52;When cocaine's effects wear off, people go through cocaine withdrawal.
Substance abuse;53;During this time, many people feel very bad.
Substance abuse;54;Suicide is most likely to happen during this time in people who use a lot of cocaine or are addicted.
Substance abuse;55;In younger adults, suicide more commonly happens when two or more drugs are taken together.
Substance abuse;56;Crystal meth   Crystal meth use has a strong link with depression and suicide, as well as a range of other bad effects on physical and mental health.
Substance abuse;57;Heroin   3% to 35% of deaths among heroin users are thought to be from suicide.
Substance abuse;58;Overall, heroin users are 14 times more likely than people who do not use heroin to die from suicide.
Substance abuse;59;Treatment of substance abuse can include both therapy and medicine.
Substance abuse;60;Therapy for substance abuse helps people not use drugs when they feel they need to.
Substance abuse;61;For children and young adults, both the child and the family may have therapy.
Substance abuse;62;The child will learn how to not abuse, and the family will learn how to help the child.
Substance abuse;63;The organization Alcoholics Anonymous helps people with alcohol abuse.
Substance abuse;64;For some kinds of substance abuse, medicine can be used to help.
Substance abuse;65;Some of these medicines, such as methadone, stop the drug from working in the brain.
Substance abuse;66;Other medicines can cause people to feel ill if they use the substance that they abuse.
Substance abuse;67;Some medicines, like bupropion, makes people stop wanting the drug so much.
Substance abuse;68;Many substances can cause withdrawal.
Substance abuse;69;Withdrawal is group of bad feelings that happen when someone stops taking a drug suddenly, if they were regularly taking that drug before.
Substance abuse;70;For someone to have withdrawal, they must be dependent on the drug.
Substance abuse;71;Different drugs cause different things to happen during withdrawal.
Substance abuse;72;They can also cause different amounts of trouble for the person in withdrawal.
Substance abuse;73;Withdrawal for some drugs, like heroin and other opiates, can be dangerous or deadly, and should be done with a doctor or nurse taking care of the person in withdrawal.
Substance abuse;74;About 9% of Americans have a substance abuse issue.
Substance abuse;75;Young people are the most likely to experiment with and abuse drugs.
Substance abuse;76;Drug abuse affects about 5% of adolescents.
Substance abuse;77;More men than women have substance abuse disorder, though women are more likely to have an issue with abusing prescription medication.
Substance abuse;78;Children who have parents with substance abuse issues are more likely to have a substance abuse issue when they grow up.
Substance abuse;79;Certain groups of people are more likely to develop substance abuse issues.
Substance abuse;80;One group is immigrants or other people who have left their home country.
Substance abuse;81;They often have issues in their new country, and some use drugs as a way to feel better.
Substance abuse;82;Another group that is at risk is homeless children.
Substance abuse;83;They will use drugs to become closer to each other.
Substance abuse;84;A third group that is at risk is musicians.
Substance abuse;85;They may use stimulants to make themselves more active and happy.
Substance abuse;86;Singers can also hurt themselves if they use drugs that are inhaled.
Substance abuse;87;The first official definition for substance abuse was made in 1932 by the American Psychiatric Association.
Substance abuse;88;This definition was only used for when the substance was illegal and not being used as medicine.
Substance abuse;89;In 1966, the American Medical Association defined abuse as the drug being given by someone to themselves without a doctor.
Substance abuse;90;The first edition of the Diagnos tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) had drug abuse as a symptom of other psychological issues.
Substance abuse;91;In the third edition, substance abuse was made its own issue.
Substance abuse;92;The DSM also has drug abuse as a different issue than drug dependence, which is defined as compulsive use of a drug.
Substance abuse;93;Most countries have laws that make having or using certain drugs illegal.
Substance abuse;94;The rules for these drugs can be different between countries or in different parts of the same country.
Substance abuse;95;Many drugs that are illegal in several places are sold to make money for groups known as drug cartels.
Substance abuse;96;Drug abuse can also cause issues in a country’s economy.
Substance abuse;97;According to the European Union, about 2.5 billion dollars are lost each year because of people abusing drugs.
Substance abuse;98;This loss comes from people not going to work or having to go to the hospital because of side effects of the drug.
Substance abuse;99;In the United Kingdom, about 29 billion dollars a year are lost.
Substance abuse;100;This number does not include the cost of police or other law enforcement.
Substance abuse;101;In the United States, the cost was 181 billion dollars in 2002.
Substance abuse;102;This number includes costs because of health issues, loss of work, law enforcement, and welfare programs.

Fragile X syndrome;1;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic syndrome that causes a range of intellectual disabilities as well as unusual physical and behavioural characteristics.
Fragile X syndrome;2;It is one of the most common causes of autism and mental retardation among boys.
Fragile X syndrome;3;Basically, these individuals lack an important gene product.
Fragile X syndrome;4;Fragile X syndrome occurs as a result of a mutation of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome.
Fragile X syndrome;5;This causes an increase an increase in the number of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1.
Fragile X syndrome;6;In unaffected individuals, the FMR1 gene contains 5–44 repeats of the CGG codon, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats.
Fragile X syndrome;7;"Between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a "" grey zone "" ."
Fragile X syndrome;8;Between 55 and 200 repeats in length is described as a premutation allele.
Fragile X syndrome;9;Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the FMR1 allele, with over 200 repeats of the CGG codon.
Fragile X syndrome;10;In these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is methylation of the CGG repeat expansion and FMR1 promoter.
Fragile X syndrome;11;This silences the FMR1 gene, and its end-product is not made.
Auditory hallucination;1;An auditory hallucination is a type of hallucination in which a person thinks they hear sounds, but the sounds are not actually there.
Auditory hallucination;2;In medical terms, it is called a paracusia.
Auditory hallucination;3;A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking.
Auditory hallucination;4;This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania.
Auditory hallucination;5;It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.
Auditory hallucination;6;People may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness.
Auditory hallucination;7;The causes are still being researched.
Auditory hallucination;8;The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia.
Auditory hallucination;9;The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.
Auditory hallucination;10;There are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions.
Auditory hallucination;11;There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three.
Auditory hallucination;12;These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with.
Auditory hallucination;13;This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity.
Auditory hallucination;14;The main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism.
Auditory hallucination;15;If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics.
Auditory hallucination;16;These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem.
Auditory hallucination;17;Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur.

Respiratory failure;1;Respiratory failure is a medical condition which affects respiration.
Respiratory failure;2;It means the alveoli in the lung are not getting enough oxygen.
Respiratory failure;3;Because of this, gas exchange in the blood is reduced.
Respiratory failure;4;Respiratory failure will lead to a person's death.
Respiratory failure;5;For this reason, it is a medical emergency.
Respiratory failure;6;Emergency treatment of respiratory failure is very similar to that of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Respiratory failure;7;Respiratory failure has been classified by its cause:   In obstructive respiratory failure, there is a mechanical problem that blocks or tightens the passage of the air.
Respiratory failure;8;Examples of conditions that can produce this include Asthma and Cystic fibrosis.
Respiratory failure;9;In restrictive respiratory failure, the volume of the person's rib cage is reduced.
Respiratory failure;10;An example for this is Scoliosis.
Respiratory failure;11;In traumatic respiratory failure, the air that is breathed takes the wrong route.
Respiratory failure;12;Examples are Pneumothorax and Hemothorax.
Respiratory failure;13;Also, respiratory failure can be classified by the speed at which it happens:   Chronic respiratory failure develops at slow speed over time.
Respiratory failure;14;Acute respiratory failure develops rapidly
Blunt trauma;1;Blunt trauma is a kind of trauma that usually results from being hit by something dull and firm (like a car, a fist, or the ground).
Blunt trauma;2;It is also called blunt force trauma.
Blunt trauma;3;This is different from penetrating trauma where an object, such as a bullet enters the body.
Blunt trauma;4;Common types of blunt force trauma include:   Being in a car accident (this is the most common cause of blunt force trauma)   Being hit by another person with a fist or with something that is not sharp, like a bat   Falling and hitting the ground (like falling down the stairs)   Jumping or falling from a high place   If blunt force trauma is not too severe, it may cause only cuts (lacerations), bruises (contusions), and scrapes (abrasions).
Blunt trauma;5;However, bad blunt force trauma can cause many serious problems, like:   Head and brain injuries   Spinal cord injuries   Crushing of the airways, making it difficult or impossible for air to be breathed in   Damage to organs (for example, collapsed lungs)   Broken bones   Severe bleeding, which can be internal (inside the body)
Penile cancer;1;Penile cancer is cancer of the penis.
Penile cancer;2;It is relatively rare in developed countries.
Penile cancer;3;In developing countries, however, it is much more common.

Combat stress reaction;1;Combat stress reaction is a medical problem that happens to some soldiers because of the trauma of war.
Combat stress reaction;2;In the past, it was called battle shock, war neurosis, or battle fatigue.
Combat stress reaction;3;It causes both mental and physical problems.
Combat stress reaction;4;It is similar to acute stress disorder, and can often become post-traumatic stress disorder.
Combat stress reaction;5;Combat stress reaction does not affect everyone equally.
Combat stress reaction;6;Sometimes it causes soldiers to be very unhappy.
Combat stress reaction;7;Sometimes it causes soldiers severe disability.
Combat stress reaction;8;The acute (early) stage of combat stress reaction is the best time to keep things from getting worse.
Combat stress reaction;9;Since World War I, soldiers in early stages of combat stress reaction have usually been treated on the front lines - close to where combat is happening.
Combat stress reaction;10;Combat stress reaction can have many different symptoms.
Combat stress reaction;11;These symptoms can affect the soldier's body (physical symptoms), feelings (emotional symptoms), and behaviors (behavioral symptoms).
Combat stress reaction;12;Depending on how bad these symptoms are, combat stress reactions are labeled from mild (not too bad) to severe (very bad).
Combat stress reaction;13;Mild physical symptoms may include:   Feeling tired   Feeling jumpy   Sweating   Having trouble sleeping   Fast heartbeat   Feeling dizzy   Feeling nauseous or throwing up   Having diarrhea   Urinating a lot   Not reacting as quickly as usual to things   Dry mouth   Tight muscles   These symptoms may not cause safety problems, or keep the soldier from working.
Combat stress reaction;14;However, if the soldier does not get help, the symptoms can become severe.
Combat stress reaction;15;"Severe symptoms may include:   Being unable to sit or stand still   Being startled very easily   Shaking or trembling   Weakness   Paralysis   Trouble hearing   Feeling exhausted   Being unable to move   Staring straight ahead without looking at anything (this is sometimes called "" the thousand-yard stare "" )   Palpitations (pounding heart)   Hyperventilation (breathing too fast)   Feeling unable to speak   Being unable to sleep   Emotional symptoms may include:   Feeling anxious   Having trouble concentrating or focusing on something   Having nightmares   Not feeling confident   Feeling angry   Feeling stressed or very upset over small things   Behavioral symptoms may include:   Not being able to make decisions   Not paying attention well   Not caring about things   Being very alert   Not feeling motivated (not wanting to do anything)   Aggressive behavior   Crying   Being unable to relax   Sigmund Freud studied the effects of "" war neurosis. """
Combat stress reaction;16;He believed that without too much stress, people can balance impulses (what they want to do) and prohibitions (what they know they should not do).
Combat stress reaction;17;However, he thought that traumatic stress can cause powerful impulses that a person can no longer control.
Combat stress reaction;18;In combat situations, he thought this could cause soldiers to run away, or to blindly attack.
Combat stress reaction;19;He believed that soldiers would try to stop these impulses, which would lead to emotional symptoms and even loss of physical abilities.
Combat stress reaction;20;"During World War I, combat stress reaction was called "" shell shock. """
Combat stress reaction;21;"By early 1916 (just halfway through the war), the number of British soldiers with "" shell shock "" was huge."
Combat stress reaction;22;Few of these soldiers returned to battle.
Combat stress reaction;23;About 30-40% of shell-shocked soldiers sent to hospitals in France returned to battle.
Combat stress reaction;24;Only about 4-5% of soldiers sent to hospitals in the United Kingdom returned.
Combat stress reaction;25;Because of this, new units were created.
Combat stress reaction;26;"They were called "" Not Yet Diagnosed, Nervous Centers. """
Combat stress reaction;27;"These centers did not use terms like "" war neurosis "" or "" shell shock. """
Combat stress reaction;28;"They used a new treatment model called "" PIE "" to treat soldiers with combat stress reaction. """
Combat stress reaction;29;"PIE "" stood for "" Proximity, Immediacy, and Expectancy "" :   Proximity meant that soldiers with combat stress reaction should be treated close to the front line (close to where combat was happening)."
Combat stress reaction;30;Immediacy meant that these soldiers should be treated right away - not just after soldiers who were physically hurt were treated.
Combat stress reaction;31;Expectancy meant that each soldier knew he was expected to return to combat.
Combat stress reaction;32;The PIE treatment model was developed by Thomas W. Salmon.
Combat stress reaction;33;"After "" PIE "" treatment was started, about 80% of soldiers treated at the "" Not Yet Diagnosed, Nervous Centers "" returned to combat."
Combat stress reaction;34;(However, some of these soldiers were not able to do a good job when they returned to combat.)
Combat stress reaction;35;British forces did not use the PIE principles during World War II.
Combat stress reaction;36;Instead, they sent soldiers with combat stress reaction to psychiatric hospitals.
Combat stress reaction;37;The United States military did not expect their soldiers to have combat stress reactions when they entered the war.
Combat stress reaction;38;They tested soldiers when they were enlisting (being signed up for military duty).
Combat stress reaction;39;They believed that this testing would show which people were 'psychologically weak,' and that these people would not be allowed to go to war.
Combat stress reaction;40;However, because combat stress reaction is not caused by weakness, this did not work, and many American soldiers had combat stress reactions.
Combat stress reaction;41;To treat these soldiers, Captain Frederick Hanson began to use the PIE principles again.
Combat stress reaction;42;He said that 70% of the 494 patients he treated returned to duty after 48 hours of PIE treatment.
Combat stress reaction;43;"General Omar Bradley decided to call combat stress reaction "" exhaustion "" and also decided to give "" exhausted "" soldiers seven days of rest."
Combat stress reaction;44;"The main goal of PIE was to return "" exhausted "" soldiers to combat, not to treat the trauma causing the disorder."
Combat stress reaction;45;Because of this, many of the soldiers who returned to duty - possibly as many as 70% - returned in non-combat positions.
Combat stress reaction;46;During the Korean War, the United States started using the PIE principles within the first 8 weeks of the war.
Combat stress reaction;47;Reports show that 65-75% of soldiers with combat stress reactions returned to duty.
Combat stress reaction;48;However, only 44% were able to do their jobs at an average level or better.
Combat stress reaction;49;At the start of the Vietnam War, the United States military had effective psychiatric services in place within 8 weeks of the start of the war.
Combat stress reaction;50;Treatments were based on the PIE principles.
Combat stress reaction;51;Special mobile psychiatric units - soldiers who could give PIE treatment in different places - were created.
Combat stress reaction;52;During the war, not many cases of combat stress reaction were reported.
Combat stress reaction;53;Because of this, many people thought that combat stress reactions would no longer play a large part in warfare.
Combat stress reaction;54;However, after soldiers returned home, many had problems with combat stress reaction.
Combat stress reaction;55;Alienation lead to substance abuse, which hid combat stress reactions that had never been treated.
Combat stress reaction;56;If the rates of post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam veterans are correct, the PIE principles did not prevent an epidemic of psychiatric disorders.
Combat stress reaction;57;The United States military went into this war expecting high numbers of psychological causalities.
Combat stress reaction;58;The treatment included traditional psychiatry, as well as attention to family issues.
Combat stress reaction;59;Because this war moved so fast, diagnosing soldiers with combat stress reaction was difficult.
Combat stress reaction;60;Some commanders used combat stress reaction as an excuse to keep soldiers from returning or kick them out of the military.
Combat stress reaction;61;This eventually added to the stigma attached to mental health problems in the military.
Combat stress reaction;62;Today, the United States Army uses the acronym BICEPS, which stands for brevity, immediacy, contact, expectancy, proximity, and simplicity:   Brevity is a short period of rest.
Combat stress reaction;63;Many soldiers return to duty after this brief rest.
Combat stress reaction;64;More seriously affected patients are referred to the next level.
Combat stress reaction;65;Immediacy means that treatment should start as soon as symptoms appear.
Combat stress reaction;66;Contact means that the soldier should be able to see members of his or her unit while getting treatment.
Combat stress reaction;67;This can help the soldier keep feeling like a soldier and a member of the unit, instead of feeling like a patient.
Combat stress reaction;68;Expectancy means soldiers should be told their reaction to stress is normal, and that they are expected back with their unit.
Combat stress reaction;69;Proximity (closeness) means that soldiers should be treated close to their unit, but away from patients who are physically hurt (unless nothing else is possible).
Combat stress reaction;70;Simplicity means treatment should involve simple ways of improving soldiers' self-confidence and physical health.
Combat stress reaction;71;"Today's treatment also includes the "" 5 R's "" :   Reassure normality (reassure soldiers that their reactions to stress are normal)   Rest   Replenish bodily needs (make sure soldiers' bodies are getting what they need, like enough food and drink)   Restore confidence   Retain (keep) contact with fellow soldiers and unit   Today, soldiers are treated for their response to combat stress, not like they have emotional problems."

Leishmaniasis;3;The disease has three forms:   Cutaneous leishmaniasis: skin ulcers   Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis: ulcers of the skin, mouth and nose   Visceral leishmaniasis: starts with skin ulcers, then fever, low red blood cells, and a large spleen and liver   Leishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania.
Leishmaniasis;4;Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization.
Leishmaniasis;5;All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope.
Leishmaniasis;6;The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test.
Leishmaniasis;7;Leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide.
Leishmaniasis;8;Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies.
Leishmaniasis;9;Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread.
Leishmaniasis;10;The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania and the type of infection.
Leishmaniasis;11;Medications used for the visceral form include: liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine.
Leishmaniasis;12;For the cutaneous form, paromomycin, fluconazole or pentamidine can help.
Leishmaniasis;13;As of 2014, about 12 million people are infected in some 98 countries.
Leishmaniasis;14;There are about 2 million new cases each year.
Leishmaniasis;15;Each year, between 20 thousand and 50 thousand people die from the disease.
Leishmaniasis;16;About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.
Leishmaniasis;17;The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease.
Leishmaniasis;18;The parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals: The disease has been described in dogs, cats, rodents, cattle and horses.
Leishmaniasis;19;In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting.
Leishmaniasis;20;Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies.
Leishmaniasis;21;These can transmit the infection Leishmania.
Leishmaniasis;22;The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1).
Leishmaniasis;23;Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3).
Leishmaniasis;24;Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which Leishmania species is involved (4).
Leishmaniasis;25;The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis.
Leishmaniasis;26;Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6).
Leishmaniasis;27;In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8).
Leishmaniasis;28;The genomes of three Leishmania species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite.
Leishmaniasis;29;Leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment.
Leishmaniasis;30;The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines.

Myasthenia gravis;4;It also gets worse with activity.
Myasthenia gravis;5;Myasthenia gravis is caused by your immune system attacking the nerves that tell your muscles to contract.
Myasthenia gravis;6;It is treated in two main ways.
Myasthenia gravis;7;First, a drug can be given to slow down your immune system using an immunosuppressant like steroids.
Myasthenia gravis;8;Alternatively, a drug can be given to turn up the signal that tells your muscles to contract.
Myasthenia gravis;9;The signal for contracting is a chemical your body makes called acetylcholine.
Myasthenia gravis;10;We turn up this signal by blocking acetylcholine breakdown - these drugs are called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

Oppositional defiant disorder;1;Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder.
Oppositional defiant disorder;2;It causes irritable and angry behaviour of at least 6 months, noticeable in communication with other people.
Oppositional defiant disorder;3;Unlike those with conduct disorder, though, most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal or cause destruction.
Oppositional defiant disorder;4;People with ODD, however, do argue and deliberately, often cause trouble.
Oppositional defiant disorder;5;In order to be diagnosed with ODD, the person must have a behavior pattern lasting at least six months.
Oppositional defiant disorder;6;At least four of these eight symptoms must be present for that time:   Often argues with adults   Goes against adults' requests and rules   Deliberately annoys other people   Blames other people for things he has done wrong   Angry and resentful of other people   Spiteful/seeks revenge   Gets annoyed easily   About 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females).

Status epilepticus;1;Status epilepticus (often simply called status) is a medical emergency where the brain will not stop having seizures.
Status epilepticus;2;"In medicine, a person who is having status epilepticus is described as being "" in status. """
Status epilepticus;3;Definitions of status epilepticus have changed over time.
Status epilepticus;4;It used to be that a seizure had to last 20 or 30 minutes to be thought of as status epilepticus.
Status epilepticus;5;(Most normal seizures last only one to two minutes.)
Status epilepticus;6;"Today, a person is usually described as being "" in status "" when:   They have a seizure that lasts more than five minutes; OR   They have more than one seizure without recovering in between.   """
Status epilepticus;7;"Recovering "" means that the person wakes up and knows who they are; where they are; and what day, month, or year it is."
Status epilepticus;8;Status epilepticus is very dangerous.
Status epilepticus;9;About 10 - 20 % of the people who go into this status die from it.
Status epilepticus;10;Status Epilepticus is considered a medical emergency for many reasons:   During a long seizure, it is very hard for the body to get oxygen to the brain and the heart.
Status epilepticus;11;Without enough oxygen, the brain cannot survive.
Status epilepticus;12;Not having enough oxygen can cause brain damage and death.
Status epilepticus;13;When the heart does not get enough oxygen, it can start to beat in ways that are not normal.
Status epilepticus;14;If the heart goes without enough oxygen for long enough, it can stop beating.
Status epilepticus;15;Status can cause very high body temperatures (hyperthermia), which can damage the brain.
Status epilepticus;16;Status can cause pulmonary edema - fluid in the lungs - which makes it hard or impossible to breathe.
Status epilepticus;17;This makes it even harder for oxygen to get to the brain, heart, and the rest of the body.
Status epilepticus;18;The nerves in the brain can get damaged by the extra electricity in the brain that happens during long seizures.
Status epilepticus;19;If people in status get the right treatment quickly, they can survive with little or no brain damage.
Status epilepticus;20;Only about one in four people who go into status epilepticus have epilepsy.
Status epilepticus;21;The other three out of four people who go into status have never had a seizure before.
Status epilepticus;22;Status epilepticus can happen for many other reasons.
Status epilepticus;23;Many different illnesses can cause status epilepticus:   In children, the most common cause of status is an infection with a fever   Brain infection   Brain tumor   Stroke   Hypoxia (not getting enough oxygen, especially to the brain)   Gastroenteritis (a special form of diarrhea) while taking anticonvulsants   Problems with metabolism (the way the body makes energy from food), like problems with the liver or kidneys   Very bad injuries can also cause status:   Injury to the head or brain   Hemorrhage (very bad bleeding)   Illegal drugs, alcohol, and some medications can cause status:   Illegal drugs   When a person stops taking certain illegal drugs suddenly   Bad reactions to some medicines, like some antidepressants   When a patient does not take enough of certain medicines, or stops taking them suddenly   Drinking too much alcohol   When a person who drinks a lot of alcohol suddenly stops drinking (alcohol withdrawal), especially if the person gets delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal   Exposure to nerve gas   People in status epilepticus are unable to end their seizures on their own.
Status epilepticus;24;They are often unconscious and unable to react.
Status epilepticus;25;The most common way to end status is to inject special medicines that can stop seizures.
Status epilepticus;26;If these medicines do not help, the patient must be treated in the intensive care unit at a hospital.
Status epilepticus;27;Sometimes patients have to be put into a coma to stop very bad status epilepticus.
Prosopagnosia;1;Prosopagnosia, also called face blindness, is a condition where a person cannot see and recognize faces.
Prosopagnosia;2;It is usually caused by a head injury to the temporal lobe of the brain.
Prosopagnosia;3;Prosopagnosia may also be a birth defect, called congenital prosopagnosia.
Prosopagnosia;4;People with this type of prosopagnosia never develop the ability to recognize faces.
Prosopagnosia;5;People with prosopagnosia usually rely on other physical features, such as the way someone walks and talks, their hair color, their height and build, etc.
Prosopagnosia;6;to recognize other people.
Prosopagnosia;7;Prosopagnosia is not curable or treatable.
Prosopagnosia;8;Prosopagnosia can be caused by lesions (broken parts of body tissue) in the lower part of the brain.
Prosopagnosia;9;It can also be caused by damaging the nerves in the lower part of the brain, called acquired prosopagnosia.
Prosopagnosia;10;It can also be caused by birth defects, carbon monoxide poisoning, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease.
Prosopagnosia;11;Doctors can check patients for prosopagnosia by using PET and fMRI scans to see if their brain reacts when they see faces.
Aortic aneurysm;1;An aortic aneurysm is a general term for an enlargement (dilation) of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size.
Aortic aneurysm;2;While the cause of an aneurysm may be unknown, the end result is weakness in the wall of the aorta at that location.
Aortic aneurysm;3;The aneurysm may occasionally cause pain, which is a sign of impending rupture.
Aortic aneurysm;4;When rupture occurs, massive internal hemorrhage results, and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur within minutes.
Thrombosis;1;"Thrombosis (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus; Greek: θρόμβος) inside a blood vessel, blocking the flow of blood through the circulatory system."
Thrombosis;2;When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss.

Vasculitis;1;Vasculitis (plural: vasculitides) is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation.
Vasculitis;2;Both arteries and veins are affected.
Vasculitis;3;Lymphangitis is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis.
Vasculitis;4;Vasculitis is primarily caused by leukocyte migration and resultant damage.
Vasculitis;5;Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins (phlebitis) or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities.
Cholangiocarcinoma;1;Cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer is a form of cancer that is formed by mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that begins in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine.
Cholangiocarcinoma;2;Other biliary tract cancers include pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer, and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Catalepsy;1;Catalepsy is a nervous condition.
Catalepsy;2;The body is fixed, with rigid muscles and fixed posture.
Catalepsy;3;The body position does not respond to stimuli, and there is decreased sensitivity to pain.
Catalepsy;4;Catalepsy is a symptom of certain nervous disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.
Catalepsy;5;It is also a characteristic symptom of cocaine withdrawal.
Catalepsy;6;It may be caused by schizophrenia treatment with anti-psychotics such as haloperidol.
Catalepsy;7;It may be caused by the anaesthetic ketamine.
Catalepsy;8;In some cases, catalepsy may be started by an extreme emotional shock – one well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on finding he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5 meters (2 feet).
Catalepsy;9;Protein kinase A has been suggested as a mediator of cataleptic behavior.

Diffuse axonal injury;1;Diffuse axonal injury (often shortened to DAI) is one of the most common forms of traumatic brain injury.
Diffuse axonal injury;2;In traumatic brain injury, the damage is focused to one area of the brain, in diffuse axonal injury, the damage occurs over a larger area of the brain.
Diffuse axonal injury;3;DAI mainly damages white matter, which makes it one of the major causes of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after head trauma.
Diffuse axonal injury;4;It occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma.
Diffuse axonal injury;5;"Frequently, people suffering such damage fall into a coma; Over 90 percent of the patients with severe DAI never regain consciousness."
Diffuse axonal injury;6;Those who do wake up often remain significantly impaired.
Diffuse axonal injury;7;Other authors state that DAI can occur in every degree of severity from (very) mild or moderate to (very) severe.
Diffuse axonal injury;8;Concussion may be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury.
Lassa fever;1;Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is a fever caused by the Lassa virus.
Lassa fever;2;It is common in West Africa.
Lassa fever;3;One in 80 people who get Lassa fever will die.
Lassa fever;4;Some cases are severe and require going to a hospital.
Lassa fever;5;These cases have a death rate of 1 in 5.
Lassa fever;6;Lassa Fever was discovered in 1969 after two nurses died from the disease.
Lassa fever;7;It was named for the town in Borno State, Nigeria where it was first diagnosed.
Lassa fever;8;Lassa fever is transmitted from rodents to humans.
Lassa fever;9;It is caused by direct contact with rodent droppings.
Lassa fever;10;It can also be transmitted by humans to other humans by their blood.
Lassa fever;11;Lassa fever is common in West and Central Africa (around the equator).
Lassa fever;12;Lassa fever cannot be transmitted by breathing.
Lassa fever;13;It is not very contagious between humans.
Lassa fever;14;However it is much more contagious among seriously ill patients.
Lassa fever;15;Lassa fever is transmitted by humans through skin lesions, mucous that is exposed to the virus, or by a patient's blood.
Lassa fever;16;This means healthcare workers (such as doctors and nurses) need to be especially careful in treating patients, or they risk getting the virus themselves.
Lassa fever;17;In 80% of cases, the disease does not have any symptoms and does not make people ill.
Lassa fever;18;In the other 20% of cases it shows symptoms and becomes much more severe.
Lassa fever;19;About 5,000 people die from it each year.
Lassa fever;20;In infected patients, the disease has an incubation period of 5 days to 3 weeks.
Lassa fever;21;During this time, the virus remains dormant and does not cause harm.
Lassa fever;22;After this time various symptoms begin to appear including:   Vomiting (with blood)   Diarrhea (with blood)   Nausea   Stomach ache   Constipation   Difficulty Swallowing   Coughing   Seizures   In laboratories, there are many ways to test if a patient has Lassa fever.
Lassa fever;23;However, in many of the affected regions, there is no equipment to do the tests.
Lassa fever;24;This means sometimes people may not be correctly tested and identified with having Lassa fever.
Lassa fever;25;If a patient is diagnosed with Lassa fever, then the patient will be kept away from other people, to prevent the spread of the virus.
Lassa fever;26;If found early, it is possible to treat Lassa fever with the medicine Ribavirin.
Lassa fever;27;Despite the fact the drug is relatively cheap, the medicine is still considered expensive for many people in affected regions.
Lassa fever;28;Patients may also require blood transfusions and rehydration.
Lassa fever;29;Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester may need their baby's birth to be induced to allow them to stand a chance of survival.
Lassa fever;30;Due to the use of Ribavirin, fewer people are dying from Lassa fever.
Lassa fever;31;It is not practical to control the amount of rodents in the affected states.
Lassa fever;32;Therefore the best way of prevention is to keep rodents out of houses and public areas to prevent people coming into contact with infected droppings.
Lassa fever;33;Infected patients should also be isolated to prevent the spread of the virus (by humans to other humans).
Lassa fever;34;In rich countries, diseases such as Lassa fever can be easily monitored by public health organisations to prevent outbreaks.
Lassa fever;35;Poor countries often cannot afford these services   There is a vaccine which has shown promise in primates.
Lassa fever;36;It has not yet been proved effective in humans.

Aneuploidy;1;Aneuploidy is a condition where the nucleus of a cell has one or a few chromosomes more or less than the usual number in the species.
Aneuploidy;2;It is a common cause of genetic disorders.
Aneuploidy;3;Aneuploidy occurs during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells.
Aneuploidy;4;Aneuploidy often causes birth defects and miscarriages.
Aneuploidy;5;Birth defects make up about 3% of births in the United States.
Aneuploidy;6;Among those who survive birth, Down syndrome is the most common form of aneuploidy.
Aneuploidy;7;Many with Down syndrome do survive to adulthood.
Aneuploidy;8;Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
Aneuploidy;9;The aneuploid theory of cancer suggests that aneuploidy is a cause of cancer rather than a result of it.

Hyperthermia;1;Hyperthermia is a high body temperature.
Hyperthermia;2;It happens when a person is not able to control their body temperature.
Hyperthermia;3;This can happen for many reasons, like very hot weather, fever, and some medicines or illegal drugs.
Hyperthermia;4;Doctors define hyperthermia as a body temperature that is over 101 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hyperthermia;5;(The average human body temperature is around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.)
Hyperthermia;6;When a person gets hyperthermia, they can have heat-related injuries, where the high body temperature hurts the body.
Hyperthermia;7;There are three forms of heat-related injuries caused by hyperthermia: heat cramps (the least serious), heat exhaustion, and heat stroke (the most serious).
Hyperthermia;8;All types of hyperthermia can be caused by the same things.
Hyperthermia;9;Some common causes are:   Weather: Weather that is very hot, sunny, and humid   Activity: Exercising or working a lot, especially if it is hot out   Older people and infants can get hyperthermia even if they are resting inside, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air.
Hyperthermia;10;This can happen because very old and very young people have trouble controlling their body temperatures.
Hyperthermia;11;Illegal drugs, especially ecstasy and amphetamines, can make the body's temperature get very hot, very quickly   Other things that make a person more likely to get hyperthermia, especially if they are exercising or working, include:   Clothing: Wearing dark clothing, hats or helmets, or padded clothing (like football pads)   Body weight: Having more body fat makes it harder for the body to cool down   Dehydration (not having enough fluids in the body): This makes it harder for the body to cool itself down by sweating   Fever: Because the body's temperature is already higher than normal   Medicines: Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines   Heat cramps are the least serious form of hyperthermia.
Hyperthermia;12;"(A "" cramp "" is a sharp pain caused by a muscle getting tighter and shorter.)"
Hyperthermia;13;The major symptoms of heat cramps are:   Painful cramps, usually in the legs or abdomen   Sweating a lot, which can cause dehydration and loss of electrolytes (important salts that the body needs)   People with heat cramps usually do not need medical treatment.
Hyperthermia;14;The best treatments for heat cramps are:   Moving to a cool place and resting   Resting the muscles that hurt   Drinking water or sports drinks to treat dehydration   Heat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps.
Hyperthermia;15;If affects the whole body instead of just certain muscles, like heat cramps.
Hyperthermia;16;"Symptoms of heat exhaustion may include:   Syncope (fainting) or dizziness   Low blood pressure   More serious dehydration   The person may be (this means they get dizzy or faint when they stand up; it is a sign of dehydration)   Feeling very thirsty with a dry mouth   Cool, clammy skin (because the body is trying as hard as it can to pull heat out of the body by sweating)   Nausea or vomiting (because of dehydration)   People with heat exhaustion may need medical treatment."
Hyperthermia;17;First aid for people with heat exhaustion includes:   Moving the person to a cool place   Having the patient take off extra layers of clothes   Cooling the patient down by fanning them and putting wet towels on their body   Having them lie down and put their feet up if they are feeling dizzy   Having them drink water or sports drinks - but only if they are awake, not confused, and not vomiting   Turning the person on their side if they are vomiting   If a person with heat exhaustion gets medical treatment, EMTs or doctors may:   Give them oxygen   Give them water and electrolytes intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein) if they are too confused to drink, or are vomiting   Heat stroke is a medical emergency.
Hyperthermia;18;If it is not treated quickly enough, it causes brain damage and death.
Hyperthermia;19;It is one of the most common causes of death in sports that can be prevented.
Hyperthermia;20;Heat stroke happens when a person gets so hot that their body cannot do anything to bring their temperature down.
Hyperthermia;21;The body has tried every strategy it has to cool itself down.
Hyperthermia;22;But the body is so hot that none of those strategies work any more.
Hyperthermia;23;This causes the body temperature to rise very quickly.
Hyperthermia;24;The body gets so hot inside that its tissues, especially the brain, get damaged.
Hyperthermia;25;Usually, people with heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.
Hyperthermia;26;The brain cannot survive for long at these temperatures.
Hyperthermia;27;Heat stroke can very quickly cause damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and muscles.
Hyperthermia;28;Often, the first signs of heat stroke are:   Agitation (the person gets upset and restless)   Confusion   A strong, fast heart rate   As heat stroke gets worse, symptoms that can kill the person start to appear.
Hyperthermia;29;For example:   Seizures, especially status epilepticus   Very low blood pressure (too low to get blood and oxygen to the brain)   A weak, slow heart rate (this is a sign that the heart cannot beat strongly enough to get blood and oxygen to the body)   Delirium or coma (caused by the brain getting so hot that it cannot work, and not getting enough oxygen)   The patient's skin will also be flushed (red), hot, and dry (because the body is no longer able to cool itself by sweating)   People with heat stroke always need emergency medical treatment as soon as possible.
Hyperthermia;30;If a person might have heat stroke, 9-1-1 or another emergency telephone number should be called right away.
Hyperthermia;31;The emergency medical dispatcher can explain what to do to help the person until an ambulance gets there.
Hyperthermia;32;Once the person with heat stroke gets to an ambulance or a hospital, treatments for heat stroke may include:   Cooling the person down as fast as possible.
Hyperthermia;33;Ways to do this include:   Taking the person's clothes off   Covering the person with wet towels   Turning up the air conditioning or turning on a fan, if possible   Putting ice packs in the person's armpits, on the back of their neck, and in their groin   Putting the person into an ice bath   Giving cold intravenous fluids, both to help cool the person down and to help with dehydration   Giving benzodiazepines to stop shivering from being cooled down so quickly (shivering makes the body even warmer)   Giving medicines to stop seizures   Giving medicines to help heart problems caused by the heat stroke   Giving oxygen, or putting a tube down the person's throat to help them breathe (this is called )   The prognosis for people with heat stroke depends on how high their body temperature got, how quickly their body temperature increased, and how quickly they got treatment.
Hyperthermia;34;Up to 80% of people who do not get treatment for heat stroke right away die.
Hyperthermia;35;But cooling people with heat stroke down right away, and getting them treatment very quickly, can change this so that only 10% die.
Hyperthermia;36;But some people who survive have brain damage or other health problems caused by their heat stroke.

Abscess;1;An abscess () is pus that has built up within the tissue of the body.
Abscess;2;Signs and symptom  s are an abscess in the hair follicles.
Abscess;3;An abscess is usually caused by a bacterial infection.
Abscess;4;Often many different types of bacteria can be part of a single infection.
Abscess;5;In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).
Abscess;6;Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world.
Abscess;7;Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is proved by cutting it open.
Abscess;8;Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear.
Abscess;9;In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.
Abscess;10;Treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is to cut it open and drain out the pus.
Abscess;11;Antibiotics are usually not needed for healthy people.
Abscess;12;New studies have found that it is better to close the wound after draining, instead of packing it with gauze.
Abscess;13;This can speed healing and not increase risk of the abscess returning.
Abscess;14;Sometimes simply sucking out the pus with a needle is not enough.
Abscess;15;Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years.
Abscess;16;As many as 65% of people who take intravenous drugs get abscesses In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess.
Abscess;17;In Australia around 13,000 people were put in hospital in 2008 for the disease.
Abscess;18;Abscesses can form in any kind of solid tissue.
Abscess;19;They are usually on the skin surface (such as a boils, or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys and tonsils.
Abscess;20;The condition can become more complicated if the pus and the infection spread to other parts of the body.
Abscess;21;This can lead to gangrene, where areas of body tissue die.
Abscess;22;The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function.
Abscess;23;There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills.
Abscess;24;Internal abscesses are more difficult to find.
Abscess;25;The abscess can be painful, and a person will have a high temperature, and generally feel unwell.
Abscess;26;Internal abscesses do not usually heal without medical treatment.
Abscess;27;In some cases an abscess could even cause death, for example where an abscess in the neck put pressure on the trachea.
Abscess;28;"If abscess is on the surface, it may be "" fluctuant "" , that is it feels like it is full of fluid, when touched."
Abscess;29;This is a wave-like motion caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess.
Abscess;30;Abscesses are caused by bacterial infection, parasites, or foreign substances.
Abscess;31;Bacterial infection is the most common cause.
Abscess;32;Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection.

Cardiovascular disease;1;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a kind of disease that involves the heart or blood vessels.
Cardiovascular disease;2;Cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack).
Cardiovascular disease;3;Other CVDs are stroke, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, endocarditis, aortic aneurysms, and peripheral artery disease.
Pulmonary contusion;1;A pulmonary contusion (or lung contusion) is a contusion (bruise) of the lung, caused by chest trauma.
Pulmonary contusion;2;The bruise harms the capillaries, and then blood and other liquids collect in the lungs.
Pulmonary contusion;3;These extra liquids prevent with gas exchange.
Pulmonary contusion;4;Without gas exchange, oxygen levels drop (hypoxia).
Pulmonary contusion;5;If the lung is cut, then the injury is instead a pulmonary laceration and has different symptoms.
Pulmonary contusion;6;A lung contusion is usually caused by blunt trauma.
Pulmonary contusion;7;Explosion injuries or a shock wave from a penetrating trauma may also cause this injury.
Pulmonary contusion;8;Doctors began studying this injury after explosives hurt soldiers in World Wars I and II.
Pulmonary contusion;9;In the 1960s when cars became popular people began to get this kind of injury from car accident  s.    Lung contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung.
Pulmonary contusion;10;In contusion, the structure of the lung does not change.
Pulmonary contusion;11;In laceration, the pieces of lung may be moved.
Pulmonary contusion;12;When blood fills lacerations, the injury is called pulmonary hematoma.
Pulmonary contusion;13;The difference between a contusion and a hematoma is that in a contusion, the alveoli (tiny air-filled sacs that give oxygen) will bleed, but a hematoma is a blood clot.
Pulmonary contusion;14;If the pleural cavity (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (hemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) or both (hemopneumothorax) then this is called a collapsed lung.
Pulmonary contusion;15;These conditions do not always damage the lung but they might, or they might be the result of damage.
Pulmonary contusion;16;Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may happen with lung injuries.
Pulmonary contusion;17;Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest.
Pulmonary contusion;18;In flail chest multiple ribs are broken move independently of the rib cage.
Pulmonary contusion;19;Pulmonary contusion is the most common injury found in blunt chest trauma, occurring in 25–35% of cases.
Pulmonary contusion;20;It is usually caused by a collision while moving quickly.
Pulmonary contusion;21;About 70% of cases result from motor vehicle collisions, most often when the chest strikes the inside of the car.
Pulmonary contusion;22;Falls, assaults, and sports injuries are other causes.
Pulmonary contusion;23;Pulmonary contusion can also be caused by explosions.
Pulmonary contusion;24;The organs most harmed by blast injuries are those that hold gas, such as the lungs.
Pulmonary contusion;25;Blast lung is severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding, or edema with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these.
Pulmonary contusion;26;This is the usual cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion.
Pulmonary contusion;27;Unlike other causes of injury in which pulmonary contusion is often found with other injuries, explosions can cause pulmonary contusion without damage to the chest wall.
Gallstone;1;A gallstone, also called a shav-stone, is a (stone) formed inside the gallbladder.
Gallstone;2;Gallstones may pass into other parts of the biliary tract.
Gallstone;3;If the stones pass out of the gall bladder they may cause extreme pain, which requires surgery or other treatment.
Meningococcal disease;1;Meningococcal disease, also called meningococcal meningitis, is infections caused by the bacterium meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis).
Meningococcal disease;2;If left untreated, the death rate is high.
Meningococcal disease;3;However, it can be prevented by vaccines.
Meningococcal disease;4;The disease is best-known for causing meningitis.
Meningococcal disease;5;It also causes blood infection, which then leads to sepsis.
Meningococcal disease;6;There are over 2,600 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States per year.
Meningococcal disease;7;In developing countries, there are over 333,000 cases per year.
Meningococcal disease;8;The case death rate is between ten and twenty percent.
Meningococcal disease;9;Meningococcal disease is not as spreadable as the common cold.
Meningococcal disease;10;However, it can be passed between people through saliva.
Autonomic dysreflexia;1;Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency.
Autonomic dysreflexia;2;AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits).
Autonomic dysreflexia;3;However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button).
Autonomic dysreflexia;4;AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Autonomic dysreflexia;5;Acute AD causes many symptoms.
Autonomic dysreflexia;6;Some are very dangerous.
Autonomic dysreflexia;7;These symptoms include:   Hypertensive emergency: the person's blood pressure gets very high all of a sudden.
Autonomic dysreflexia;8;The blood pressure can get so high that it can cause a stroke.
Autonomic dysreflexia;9;bradycardia, a slow heart rate.
Autonomic dysreflexia;10;If the heart beats too slowly, the rest of the body cannot get enough blood or oxygen.
Autonomic dysreflexia;11;This is dangerous, because every part of the body needs blood (which carries oxygen) to survive.
Autonomic dysreflexia;12;For example:   If the brain does not get enough oxygen, a person can get brain damage or die.
Autonomic dysreflexia;13;If the heart does not get enough oxygen, it can stop beating normally or even stop beating completely.
Autonomic dysreflexia;14;Bad headaches   Very bad sweating   Stuffy nose   Skin flushing (redness) above the level of the spinal injury   anxiety   Thinking problems   Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited.
Autonomic dysreflexia;15;The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly.
Autonomic dysreflexia;16;Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves.
Autonomic dysreflexia;17;Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react.
Autonomic dysreflexia;18;Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller.
Autonomic dysreflexia;19;This is part of the fight or flight response.
Progeria;1;Progeria () , also called Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome and HGPS progeria syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder.
Progeria;2;Children born with progeria show symptoms which are like aging.
Progeria;3;This can include skin wrinkles and grey hair or baldness.
Progeria;4;Progeria is one of several progeroid syndromes.
Progeria;5;"The word progeria comes from the Greek words "" pro "" (πρό), meaning "" before "" or "" premature "" , and "" gēras "" (γῆρας), meaning "" old age "" ."
Progeria;6;It is very rare, only 1 child in every 8 million live births.
Progeria;7;People with progeria usually only live to their mid teens to early twenties.
Progeria;8;It is a genetic condition that occurs as a new mutation.
Progeria;9;It is rarely inherited, as people with the condition do not usually live long enough to have children.
Progeria;10;Scientists are studying progeria because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging.
Progeria;11;Progeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson.
Progeria;12;It was also described independently in 1897 by Hastings Gilford.
Progeria;13;The condition was later named Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome.
Pulmonary edema;1;"Pulmonary edema (pulmonary oedema in British English) is fluid in the lungs ( "" Pulmonary "" means "" lungs "" ; "" edema "" means "" swelling "" or "" fluid "" )."
Pulmonary edema;2;Normally, the lungs fill with air when a person breathes in.
Pulmonary edema;3;From the alveoli in the lungs, oxygen goes into the blood.
Pulmonary edema;4;The blood then carries oxygen to the entire body.
Pulmonary edema;5;Every part of the body needs oxygen to survive.
Pulmonary edema;6;When a person has fluid in their lungs (pulmonary edema), there is not enough space left for air to get into the lungs.
Pulmonary edema;7;The person will not be able to breathe in as much air.
Pulmonary edema;8;This means not as much oxygen will get into the blood, and the body will not get the oxygen it needs.
Pulmonary edema;9;The most common cause of pulmonary edema is heart failure on the left side of the heart.
Pulmonary edema;10;The left side of the heart is supposed to pump blood to the entire body.
Pulmonary edema;11;If the left side of the heart is too weak to do this, blood will back up into the lungs.
Pulmonary edema;12;This is called cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary edema;13;"( "" Cardiogenic "" means "" caused by the heart. """
Pulmonary edema;14;)   Other, non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema include:   Fluid overload: When a person with kidney failure eats too much salt or drinks too much fluid.
Pulmonary edema;15;Because the kidneys cannot filter out fluids like they normally do, the fluid backs up into the lungs.
Pulmonary edema;16;Smoke inhalation   Drowning in salt water   High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), which happens when people are at very high altitudes, like climbing mountains   Hypothermia (a very low body temperature)   Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, caused by some kind of lung illness (like pneumonia or sepsis) or injury (like smoke inhalation)   Pulmonary embolism, where a blood clot from one part of the body travels to the lungs   Injury to the chest or lungs   Infections caused by viruses, like dengue fever   Bad reactions to drugs, including illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine, and legal medicines like aspirin   Symptoms of pulmonary edema may include:   Difficulty breathing   Orthopnea (breathing is hardest when lying down)   Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (this means that difficulty breathing may wake the person up when they are sleeping at night)   Pink, frothy sputum   A medical professional will hear rales when they listen to breath sounds with a stethoscope   Flash pulmonary edema is a medical emergency.
Pulmonary edema;17;It is pulmonary edema that comes on very quickly.
Pulmonary edema;18;Usually pulmonary edema takes a few hours to develop.
Pulmonary edema;19;But in the worst cases of flash pulmonary edema, a person's lungs can fill completely with fluid in minutes.
Pulmonary edema;20;Flash pulmonary edema can also be caused by moving a person with pulmonary edema, or lying them down.
Pulmonary edema;21;"No matter what the cause is, pulmonary edema can be treated by:   Giving the person oxygen   Sitting the person straight up (this makes it easier to breathe)   Forcing air into the person's lungs (this is called ventilation) if needed   Diuretic medicines, which remove extra fluid from the body   Medicines like nitroglycerine ( "" nitro "" ), which reduce the pressure caused by fluid going into the lungs."
Pulmonary edema;22;"Nitroglycerine can also make the blood vessels in the lungs wider, so more fluid fits into them; this can free up some extra space for air to get into the lungs."
Pulmonary edema;23;Other treatments can focus on the cause of the pulmonary edema.
Pulmonary edema;24;For example, if a person with kidney failure has had too much salt or fluid, they can have dialysis to take away the extra fluid and salt.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;1;Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), previously known as multiple organ failure (MOF), Total organ failure(TOF) or multisystem organ failure (MSOF), is when the organ function is acutely ill and the patient is required medical intervention to achieve homeostasis.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;2;It usually involves two or more organ systems.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;3;"The use of "" multiple organ failure "" or "" multisystem organ failure "" should be avoided since that phrase was based upon physiological parameters to determine whether or not a particular organ was failing."
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;4;The condition usually results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;5;The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;6;Sepsis is the most common cause in operative and non-operative patients.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;7;Sepsis may result in septic shock.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;8;Four clinical phases have been suggested:   Stage 1 the patient has increased volume requirements and mild respiratory alkalosis which is accompanied by oliguria, hyperglycemia and increased insulin requirements.
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;9;"Stage 2 the patient is tachypneic, hypocapnic and hypoxemic; develops moderate liver dysfunction and possible hematologic abnormalities."
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;10;"Stage 3 the patient develops shock with azotemia and acid-base disturbances; has significant coagulation abnormalities."
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;11;"Stage 4 the patient is vasopressor dependent and oliguric or anuric; subsequently develops ischemic colitis and lactic acidosis."

Bradycardia;1;Bradycardia (also called bradyarrhythmia) is a slow heart rate.
Bradycardia;2;In adults, bradycardia is defined as a heart rate that is under 60 beats per minute (bpm) while the person is resting.
Bradycardia;3;Bradycardia is a type of cardiac arrhythmia.
Bradycardia;4;There are many types of bradycardia.
Bradycardia;5;Some are caused by problems with the heart.
Bradycardia;6;Bradycardia can also be caused by medicines, drugs, and many other things.
Bradycardia;7;The symptoms of bradycardia depend on how slow the heart rate is and what kind of problem the heart is having.
Bradycardia;8;For most people, bradycardia is not a serious problem.
Bradycardia;9;But it can become a serious problem if it signals a major problem with the heart.
Bradycardia;10;Also, if bradycardia gets very bad, the heart will be unable to pump enough blood and oxygen to the body.
Bradycardia;11;Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive.
Bradycardia;12;If bradycardia is bad enough, it can cause organ damage, brain damage, and death.
Bradycardia;13;Problems with the heart's electrical system.
Bradycardia;14;There are two atria (upper chambers) in the heart: the right atrium and the left atrium.
Bradycardia;15;For the heart to beat normally, special parts of the right atrium have to send electricity through the heart to make it squeeze out blood.
Bradycardia;16;The electricity has to start in a certain place and pass through a certain route in the heart.
Bradycardia;17;If this does not happen correctly, the heart will not beat correctly.
Bradycardia;18;Medications, like beta blockers   Depressant medications or drugs

Gender dysphoria;2;It describes people who strongly feel they are not the gender they were born with.
Gender dysphoria;3;"It used to be called "" gender identity disorder. """
Gender dysphoria;4;But it is not a mental illness.
Gender dysphoria;5;It is a condition accompanied by stress, anxiety, and depression.
Gender dysphoria;6;To be diagnosed with gender dysphoria now, patients must exhibit strong cross-gender feelings that persist over time.
Gender dysphoria;7;It is not just a desire to change sex for some advantage they might think exists.
Gender dysphoria;8;Gender dysphoria may cause many to become socially isolated.
Gender dysphoria;9;Boys especially may be ostracized which can lead to low self-esteem.
Gender dysphoria;10;It often leads to avoiding or dropping out of school.
Gender dysphoria;11;Feminine speech patterns and mannerisms are common in boys with gender dysphoria.

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;1;"Creutzfeldt & ndash;Jakob disease (pronounced ) or CJD is a neurological disease."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;2;"CJD is sometimes called a human form of "" mad cow disease "" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE)."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;3;"BSE is actually a cause of one rare type of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; the two are not the same disease."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;4;CJD is caused by an infectious agent called a prion.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;5;Prions are proteins that are folded wrong.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;6;Prions make copies of themselves by changing correctly folded proteins into misfolded shapes.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;7;CJD causes brain tissue to become unhealthy very quickly.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;8;As the disease destroys the brain, the brain develops holes.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;9;The brain's texture changes and becomes like a kitchen sponge.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;10;"Types of CJD include:   variant (vCJD):   :This type of CJD may be caused by eating food that has prions in it, like meat from cows that have BSE ( "" mad cow disease "" )."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;11;However, this is a very uncommon cause of CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;12;sporadic (sCJD):   :This is the most common type of CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;13;85% of cases of CJD are sporadic CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;14;"Nobody knows what causes sCJD; it seems to happen randomly."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;15;familial (fCJD):   :Most of the other 15% of cases of CJD are familial CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;16;This is a form of CJD runs in families.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;17;iatrogenic:   :This form of CJD is usually caused by a medical procedure where a person gets blood or tissue from someone with CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;18;For example, if a person can get iatrogenic CJD if they get a blood transfusion or a cornea transplant from someone who has CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;19;The first symptom of CJD is dementia, which gets worse very quickly.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;20;dementia causes memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;21;Other common mental symptoms include:   Anxiety   Depression   Paranoia   Obsessive-compulsive symptoms   Psychosis   Physical symptoms of CJD often include:   Trouble speaking   Jerky movements (myoclonus)   Trouble with balance (ataxia)   Trouble walking   Shaking or being stiff   Vision problems   Trouble swallowing, which can make eating difficult or impossible   Trouble coughing, which can cause pneumonia   Movements that the patient cannot control (dyskinesia)   Most people with CJD die within six months after their first symptoms appeared.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;22;Often, they die of pneumonia caused by trouble coughing.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;23;About 15% of patients survive for two or more years.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;24;Some patients have lived 4–5 years with mostly mental symptoms until the disease gets worse and causes more physical symptoms.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;25;Once this happens, people usually die within a year.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;26;The symptoms of CJD are caused by the death of more and more of the brain's nerve cells.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;27;When scientists look at brain tissue from a CJD patient under a microscope, they can see many tiny holes where whole areas of nerve cells have died.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;28;Doctors may suspect CJD when a person has certain symptoms.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;29;For example, dementia usually gets worse slowly.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;30;Dementia that gets worse very quickly is unusual.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;31;Along with symptoms like jerky movements, these symptoms may point to possible CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;32;Tests can then be done to show whether the person has CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;33;These tests include:   Electroencephalography (EEG): This test shows the electrical activity in the brain.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;34;A doctor will often be able to see changes in the EEG that are common in people with CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;35;The type of changes that show on the EEG will depend on the type of CJD the patient has, and how far along their disease is.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;36;"Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test makes it possible to study cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), looking for a specific protein ( "" 14-3-3 protein "" )   MRI of the brain: A test that uses a very strong magnet to take pictures of the brain   Biopsy: To do a biopsy, a surgeon uses a needle to take a small piece of tissue from the body, so doctors can look at it under a microscope."
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;37;vCJD can be diagnosed with a biopsy of the tonsils.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;38;For all of the other types of CJD, a biopsy of the brain is the only way to tell for sure if a person has CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;39;However, since a biopsy of the brain can cause brain damage, a brain biopsy is usually not done if other tests have already shown that a person probably has CJD.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;40;As of 2016, there is no treatment that cures CJD or even slows down its effects.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;41;Many experiments are being done to try to find treatments.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;42;Today, the only treatments for CJD are medicines that treat the disease's symptoms and help patients be more comfortable.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;43;For example, patients who have seizures may be given anticonvulsant medications.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;44;Benzodiazepines can make muscle jerks happen less often.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;45;Patients may also choose to have medical procedures to help with bad symptoms.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;46;For example, CJD may cause so much trouble swallowing that a person cannot eat.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;47;Some people with CJD choose to have a feeding tube put in when they can no longer eat.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease;48;This is a tube that goes into the stomach, so that special liquid can be given right into the stomach to give the person nutrition.

Ventricular tachycardia;1;Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a type of tachycardia (a fast heart rate).
Ventricular tachycardia;2;The heart has four chambers (closed spaces).
Ventricular tachycardia;3;The top two are called the atria, and the bottom two are called the ventricles.
Ventricular tachycardia;4;When the heart is working normally, electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first.
Ventricular tachycardia;5;However, in ventricular tachycardia, the ventricles squeeze first.
Ventricular tachycardia;6;This happens because the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working.
Ventricular tachycardia;7;Ventricular tachycardia is a medical emergency.
Ventricular tachycardia;8;First of all, if the heart is beating too fast, it does not have time to refill with blood between beats.
Ventricular tachycardia;9;This means that the heart will not be able to squeeze out enough blood to the rest of the body.
Ventricular tachycardia;10;Most people in ventricular tachycardia have a heart rate of at least 170 beats per minute.
Ventricular tachycardia;11;This is very fast.
Ventricular tachycardia;12;(A normal heart rate is 60-100.)
Ventricular tachycardia;13;Ventricular tachycardia can also cause low blood pressure.
Ventricular tachycardia;14;If the blood pressure gets low enough, important parts of the body, like the brain, will not get enough blood and oxygen to survive.
Ventricular tachycardia;15;Ventricular tachycardia can also lead to ventricular fibrillation, asystole (where the heart stops beating), and sudden death.
Ventricular tachycardia;16;The most common symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are feeling dizzy, having palpitations (feeling the heart pounding inside the chest), having trouble breathing, or chest pain.
Ventricular tachycardia;17;Some people with ventricular tachycardia do not have any symptoms, especially if the V-tach lasts for only a few seconds.
Ventricular tachycardia;18;When a person's heart rate is very high, or the ventricular tachycardia lasts for more than a few seconds, the person may faint or become unconscious because their brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen.
Ventricular tachycardia;19;In the worst cases, their heart may stop, or they may die.
Ventricular tachycardia;20;A doctor can diagnose ventricular tachycardia by doing an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or an EKG).
Ventricular tachycardia;21;This is a test that shows the electrical activity in the heart.
Ventricular tachycardia;22;The doctor will be able to see that the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working.
Ventricular tachycardia;23;Ventricular tachycardia can be treated in a few different ways.
Ventricular tachycardia;24;Treatment depends on whether the patient still has a pulse.
Ventricular tachycardia;25;If the patient is in pulseless ventricular tachycardia, their heart is beating so fast that it cannot squeeze out any blood.
Ventricular tachycardia;26;If a person still has a pulse, ventricular tachycardia can usually be stopped through cardioversion.
Ventricular tachycardia;27;Cardioversion means using medication or an electric shock to make the heart start beating normally again.
Ventricular tachycardia;28;If a person has pulseless ventricular tachycardia, they need to be shocked with a defibrillator.
Ventricular tachycardia;29;Two different types of defibrillators can be used.
Ventricular tachycardia;30;An external defibrillator is a machine that delivers a shock through two sticky pads that are placed on the person's chest.
Ventricular tachycardia;31;However, some people who have already been diagnosed with V-tach have surgery to put a defibrillator inside their chest.
Ventricular tachycardia;32;This is called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
Ventricular tachycardia;33;This type of defibrillator shocks the heart automatically when it goes into V-tach.
Ventricular tachycardia;34;If a person goes into pulseless ventricular tachycardia, first aid can be helpful.
Ventricular tachycardia;35;9-1-1 or the local emergency telephone number should be called immediately.
Ventricular tachycardia;36;Then - like in any situation where a person suddenly becomes unconscious and has no pulse - cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started right away.
Ventricular tachycardia;37;An emergency medical dispatcher can help explain how to do CPR until an ambulance gets there.
Ventricular tachycardia;38;Ventricular tachycardia can be caused by many different things.
Ventricular tachycardia;39;The most common cause is ischemic heart disease (heart disease that causes the heart to not get enough oxygen).
Ventricular tachycardia;40;Ventricular tachycardia can also be caused by other problems, like:   Cardiomyopathies (diseases that affect the heart muscle)   Diseases like sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis that can affect the whole body, if they attack the heart muscle   Problems with electrolytes, like not having enough potassium, calcium, or magnesium   Illegal drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine   Certain kinds of medications   Sometimes doctors cannot find a cause for ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular tachycardia;41;This is called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular tachycardia;42;Ventricular tachycardia causes most of the sudden cardiac deaths in the United States.
Ventricular tachycardia;43;It causes about 300,000 deaths every year.
Ventricular tachycardia;44;"The chance of sudden death is highest for people who:   Have ischemic cardiomyopathy (their heart muscle was damaged by not getting enough oxygen); and   Have ventricular tachycardia that comes and goes   The chance of sudden death is lowest for people with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia."
Ventricular tachycardia;45;Even for high-risk people, treatment with medications like beta blockers can help.
Ventricular tachycardia;46;So can implantable cardio-defibrillators.
Ventricular tachycardia;47;Cardiac arrhythmia   Tachycardia
Chikungunya;1;"Chikungunya (pronounced "" chicken-GUN-yay "" ) is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus."
Chikungunya;2;It can cause joint pains that can last for weeks, months, or sometimes even years.
Chikungunya;3;About 1 in every 1000 people who gets chikungunya dies.
Chikungunya;4;People who are elderly or have other medical problems are most likely to die or get very sick from chikungunya.
Chikungunya;5;Chikungunya is spread to humans by two species of mosquito: Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti.
Chikungunya;6;These mosquitoes carry the infection to humans after biting monkeys, birds, cattle, or rodents who have chikungunya.
Chikungunya;7;Since 2004, there have been outbreaks (where many people get chikungunya) in Asia, Europe, and The Americas.
Chikungunya;8;There is no known treatment or cure for chikungunya.
Chikungunya;9;It can take one to twelve days for a person to get sick after they get the chikungunya virus.
Chikungunya;10;(This period of time is called the virus's incubation period.)
Chikungunya;11;Usually, people get sick in three to seven days.
Chikungunya;12;Most people who get the virus (72% to 97%) get symptoms.
Chikungunya;13;Chikungunya has an acute phase, which lasts a short time, and a chronic phase, which can last weeks, months, or years.
Chikungunya;14;The acute phase usually begins with a sudden high fever that can last up to ten days.
Chikungunya;15;The fever is usually above 39 °C (102 °F), and can sometimes get as high as 40 °C (104 °F).
Chikungunya;16;About half of people with chikungunya get a rash, usually about two to five days after symptoms start.
Chikungunya;17;Some people also have gastrointestinal symptoms, like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Chikungunya;18;In rare cases, people may get conjunctivitis or other problems with their eyes.
Chikungunya;19;The body starts to fight the virus after about a week by sending out immunoglobulin M (IgM), which attacks the virus.
Chikungunya;20;After this, most of the symptoms usually start to get better.
Chikungunya;21;However, people often keep having some symptoms for about another week, like headache, insomnia (trouble sleeping), and exhaustion.
Chikungunya;22;After these symptoms end, the acute phase of chikungunya is usually over.
Chikungunya;23;In chikungunya's chronic phase, almost everyone with the virus (87% - 98%) gets very bad joint pain or stiffness.
Chikungunya;24;This usually lasts for weeks or months.
Chikungunya;25;However, it can last for years.
Chikungunya;26;The joint pain can be so bad that a person cannot move the joints that hurt.
Chikungunya;27;The pain almost always happens in more than one joint.
Chikungunya;28;Usually, people have pain in the joints in their arms and legs, on both sides.
Chikungunya;29;These may include the joints in the wrists, ankles, hands, feet, shoulders, elbows, and knees.
Chikungunya;30;The virus can also cause pain in the muscles or ligaments.
Chikungunya;31;Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between chikungunya and dengue fever.
Chikungunya;32;Both infections cause some of the same symptoms, like fever and very bad pain.
Chikungunya;33;However, chikungunya usually does not cause bleeding.
Chikungunya;34;If a person diagnosed with chikungunya has bleeding problems, they may:   Have dengue fever instead of chikungunya   Have both chikungunya and dengue fever (both are spread by mosquitoes, and are common in some of the same places)   Have both chikungunya and liver problems   The best way for people to protect themselves from chikungunya is to protect themselves from mosquitoes in places where the disease is common.
Chikungunya;35;For example, people may use bug spray and mosquito nets, and wear long sleeves and long pants when they are outside.
Chikungunya;36;In places where chikungunya is common, governments can also do things to control the number of mosquitoes.
Chikungunya;37;For example, they can spray pesticides.
Chikungunya;38;There is no vaccine for chikungunya.
Chikungunya;39;Scientists are doing experiments to try to make a vaccine.
Chikungunya;40;However, scientists say that even if they created a vaccine, people would still have to control mosquitoes to prevent chikungunya.
Chikungunya;41;There is no known treatment for chikungunya.
Chikungunya;42;No known anti-viral medicines (medicines which kill viruses) kill the chikungunya virus.
Chikungunya;43;"Medical professionals can only give "" supportive care. """
Chikungunya;44;This means they can only treat chikungunya's symptoms.
Chikungunya;45;"For example, they may treat fever and joint pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen; painkillers like paracetamol (acetaminophen); and fluids."
Chikungunya;46;Aspirin is not given because it can make bleeding more likely to happen.
Chikungunya;47;Scientists have not found any medication that helps everyone with chikungunya who has bad joint pain.
Chikungunya;48;There is some evidence that certain medicines may help people who have bad joint pain for more than two weeks.
Chikungunya;49;These medicines include:   Ribavirin, an anti-viral medicine   Chloroquine, a medicine usually given to prevent malaria   Methotrexate, a medicine used for rheumatoid arthritis, which also causes very bad joint pain   These medicines do not help the symptoms of chikungunya during the acute phase.
Chikungunya;50;About 1 in 1000 people who get chikungunya die from the disease.
Chikungunya;51;People older than 65, newborn babies, and people with other medical problems are most likely to have the most dangerous problems.
Chikungunya;52;Chikungunya is especially dangerous for newborns because they can get the virus from their mothers during childbirth, and because newborns' immune systems have to grow before they work as well as adults'.
Chikungunya;53;This makes it much more difficult for newborns to fight off the virus.
Chikungunya;54;Elderly people, and people who already have arthritis, are more likely to have chronic joint pain.
Chikungunya;55;In the past, chikungunya existed mostly in developing countries.
Chikungunya;56;However, more recently, there have been epidemics (where a very large number of people get the virus) in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Islands, and the Americas.
Chikungunya;57;When chikungunya was first discovered in 1952, it was uncommon and happened only in West Africa.
Chikungunya;58;People usually got the disease during rainy seasons, because mosquitoes are more common during these times.
Chikungunya;59;Beginning in the 1960s, there were sometimes outbreaks in Asia and Africa.
Chikungunya;60;However, until 2005, chikungunya had been uncommon throughout the world.
Chikungunya;61;Since 2005, chikungunya has become much more common.
Chikungunya;62;It has caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Chikungunya;63;For example, in India, chikungunya re-appeared after 32 years where no Indian person had gotten the virus.
Chikungunya;64;Outbreaks have also happened in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, where chikungunya had never spread before.
Chikungunya;65;A few people have also gotten chikungunya in the United States and Australia, where the virus had never lived before.
Chikungunya;66;In 2005, there was a very large outbreak on Réunion, an island in the Indian Ocean.
Chikungunya;67;Out of about 770,000 people who lived on the island, about 266,000 (over 1 in every 3 people) got chikungunya.
Chikungunya;68;In 2006, about 1.25 million people in India got the virus.
Chikungunya;69;Chikungunya was recently spread to the Americas.
Chikungunya;70;From 2013-2014 in the Americas, 1,118,763 people have been thought to have the virus.
Chikungunya;71;Of these cases, 24,682 were proven to be chikungunya.
Chikungunya;72;Some scientists think that chikungunya has become much more common because of a change in the virus's genetic code.
Chikungunya;73;This change may have made it easier for the virus to make copies of itself in mosquito cells.
Chikungunya;74;It may have also allowed the virus to be spread more easily by the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus).
Chikungunya;75;This is important because the Asian tiger mosquito lives in many more places than Aedes aegypti, the other species of mosquito that spreads chikungunya to humans.
Chikungunya;76;Aedes aegypti lives only in tropical places.
Chikungunya;77;However, the Asian tiger mosquito spreads easily, and lives in Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East.
Chikungunya;78;Chikungunya was first described by Marion Robinson and W.H.R.
Chikungunya;79;Lumsden in 1955, after an outbreak in 1952 along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania).
Chikungunya;80;A group called the Makonde lived in this area.
Chikungunya;81;"The word "" chikungunya "" probably comes from the Makonde language."
Chikungunya;82;"It means "" that which bends up "" or "" to walk bent over. """
Chikungunya;83;This describes how people with very bad joint pain from the virus would bend into unusual positions.
Chikungunya;84;The first recorded outbreak of chikungunya may have been in 1779.
Chikungunya;85;Scientific evidence agrees that the virus evolved around the year 1700.
Chikungunya;86;Chikungunya was once researched as a possible biological weapon.
Zika fever;1;Zika fever is an illness caused by the Zika virus.
Zika fever;2;The Zika virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus, like dengue fever and chikungunya.
Zika fever;3;However, Zika fever is usually not as bad as those illnesses.
Zika fever;4;Most people who get the Zika virus (60-80%) have no symptoms.
Zika fever;5;People who do have symptoms usually have a low fever, conjunctivitis, joint pain (mainly in the hands and feet), and a rash.
Zika fever;6;The rash often starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.
Zika fever;7;Usually, the symptoms are not very bad, and get better after 2 to 7 days.
Zika fever;8;Starting in 2015, there has been an outbreak of Zika virus (meaning that many people have gotten the virus) in Brazil.
Zika fever;9;Scientists think that when a woman with the Zika virus is pregnant, she can give the virus to her fetus.
Zika fever;10;Scientists think this can cause microcephaly , a birth defect that causes a baby to have a smaller head than usual.
Zika fever;11;This can cause intellectual disability and other problems in the brain, like seizures.
Zika fever;12;Because of this, in January 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned pregnant women not to travel to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, or Puerto Rico, because of the risk of getting the Zika virus there.
Zika fever;13;In places where the Zika virus lives, people are more likely to have birth defects, neurological problems like Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune diseases.
Zika fever;14;Diagnosing Zika fever is difficult for a few reasons.
Zika fever;15;First, Zika fever causes many of the same signs and symptoms as many other viruses.
Zika fever;16;Second, special laboratory tests have to be done to prove that a person has Zika virus.
Zika fever;17;For example, when the virus is in a person's blood or urine, it can be found by using a special test that looks for the virus's RNA in the blood.
Zika fever;18;However, the Zika virus often does not stay in the blood for very long.
Zika fever;19;Also, because most people with the Zika virus have no symptoms, they do not know that they need to be tested.
Zika fever;20;Blood tests that look for specific antibodies (which the body sends out to fight the Zika virus) can also be done.
Zika fever;21;However, these tests are expensive and have to be done in special laboratories that do not exist everywhere.
Zika fever;22;If tests cannot prove that a person has Zika virus, it can be difficult to figure out whether a person has Zika fever or a different infection.
Zika fever;23;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that before doctors diagnose a person with Zika fever, they should think about whether the person could have one of many other infections.
Zika fever;24;Examples of these infections include:   Dengue fever   West Nile virus   Chikungunya   Malaria   Rubella   Measles   Leptospirosis   Humans get the Zika virus after being bitten by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus.
Zika fever;25;Scientists have proven that at least eight different species of mosquitoes from the Aedes genus can spread the Zika virus to humans.
Zika fever;26;Mosquitoes pick up the Zika virus after they bite other animals that have the virus.
Zika fever;27;Zika virus can be passed from one person to another during sexual intercourse.
Zika fever;28;It can also be passed from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy.
Zika fever;29;There is no vaccine for Zika virus, though the United States National Institutes of Health is trying to make one.
Zika fever;30;The best way for a person to protect themselves against the Zika virus is to protect themselves against mosquitoes.
Zika fever;31;For example, if people are traveling to places where the Zika virus lives, they should:   Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants   Use bug spray   Stay and sleep in rooms that are protected by window and door screens, and that have air conditioning (if possible)   Use a mosquito net when sleeping   Today, there is no treatment or cure for Zika fever.
Zika fever;32;"Medical professionals can only give "" supportive care, "" which means they can only treat the virus's symptoms."
Zika fever;33;For example, they can give medicines to help with pain, fever, and itching.
Zika fever;34;However, some scientists say that doctors should not give medicines like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used for pain and fever.
Zika fever;35;This is because people with similar viruses who take these medicines have been more likely to have bleeding problems.
Zika fever;36;There are no known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) which will kill the Zika virus.
Zika fever;37;Because there are no treatments that will cure the Zika virus once a person has it, scientists suggest that pregnant women do everything they can to avoid getting the virus.
Zika fever;38;Once a pregnant woman has the Zika virus, there is nothing anyone can do to keep her fetus from getting infected too.
Zika fever;39;Zika fever was first discovered in 1947, in a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest in Uganda.
Zika fever;40;The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954.
Zika fever;41;A few outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa and in some parts of Southeast Asia.
Zika fever;42;, but not India.
Zika fever;43;In 1977–1978, Zika virus caused fevers in Indonesia.
Zika fever;44;The first major outbreak happened in 2007 in Micronesia's Yap Islands.
Zika fever;45;185 people were proven to have the Zika virus.
Zika fever;46;This was the first time Zika fever had been reported outside Africa and Asia.
Zika fever;47;In 2013, another large outbreak happened in French Polynesia.
Zika fever;48;In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of Zika fever.
Zika fever;49;By November 2015, Zika fever had appeared in 14 states in Brazil.
Zika fever;50;Zika virus is thought to have caused 2,400 cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015.
Zika fever;51;Since first appearing in the Western Hemisphere in February 2014, Zika fever has spread quickly throughout South America and Central America.
Zika fever;52;It appeared in Mexico in November 2015.
Zika fever;53;On January 24, 2016, the World Health Organization warned that the Zika virus is likely to spread to nearly all countries of the Americas.
Zika fever;54;This is likely since the mosquito that spreads the virus, Aedes aegypti, lives in all of the countries in the Americas, except for Canada and Chile.
Zika fever;55;"On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization said that the Zika virus was a "" public health emergency. """
Zika fever;56;"They also said the Zika virus was "" spreading explosively "" (very quickly), and that in the next year, as many as 3 million to 4 million people could get the virus."

Marasmus;1;Marasmus is a form of malnutrition.
Marasmus;2;It happens in people (especially children) who do not get enough food.
Marasmus;3;A healthy person gets energy from eating food, especially foods with protein and fat in them.
Marasmus;4;Because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food, they do not get the energy they need to survive.
Marasmus;5;This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories.
Marasmus;6;Generally, this disease when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births.
Marasmus;7;Lean and weak, swelling limbs, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc.., are the symptoms of this disease.
Marasmus;8;Children with marasmus look emaciated (very skinny).
Marasmus;9;This is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and muscles to make energy.
Marasmus;10;The child's body weight will be less than 60% of a normal child his or her age.
Marasmus;11;Marasmus can be treated.
Marasmus;12;However, about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they cannot get treatment where they live.
Marasmus;13;"The word “marasmus” comes from the Greek word μαρασμός marasmos (meaning "" decay  )   Most children with marasmus look shrunken and have lost most of their muscles and body fat."
Marasmus;14;Their bodies try to save as much energy as possible by shutting down the immune system, not growing, and giving less energy to the liver, kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal system.
Marasmus;15;This can cause problems like:   Having too much fluid in the body, because the kidneys are not working well enough to get rid of it.
Marasmus;16;This can lead toedema (fluid under the skin) and even heart failure.
Marasmus;17;Hypothermia (low body temperature), because staying warm takes energy, and because the child has almost no fat or muscles to keep them warm   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), because the child is not getting sugar or carbohydrates from foods   Infection, because the child's body has shut down the immune system, which usually fights infection, to save energy   Other symptoms of marasmus include:   Anemia (not having enough red blood cells in the blood)   Dehydration, not having enough water in the body   Shock caused by dehydration (hypovolemic shock)   Tachypnea (breathing too fast - for example, from pneumonia or heart failure)   Eye problems   Skin problems   Problems with the ears, nose, and throat (like ear infections)   Marasmus is caused by a deficiency (not having enough) of nearly all nutrients, especially protein, carbohydrates, and lipids (fats).
Marasmus;18;Marasmus can be treated by giving emergency nutrients and fluids.
Marasmus;19;However, treating the causes of marasmus is not enough.
Marasmus;20;Often, the disease has complications (it causes other problems), like infections, dehydration, and problems with the circulatory system.
Marasmus;21;These complications are very dangerous and often kill children if they are not treated correctly.
Marasmus;22;Malnutrition   Starvation   Kwashiorkor (a similar disease caused by not having enough protein)
Serotonin syndrome;1;Serotonin syndrome, also known as serotonin poisoning, serotonin sickness, and many other names, is a medical condition that can happen if there is too much serotonin in your brain or other parts of your nervous system.
Serotonin syndrome;2;Serotonin syndrome can be mild (doesn't make you very sick), but in rare situations, it can kill you.
Serotonin syndrome;3;Serotonin syndrome can happen if you use some drugs that can increase the amount of serotonin in your nervous system.
Serotonin syndrome;4;Some examples of drugs that can make you have serotonin syndrome are antidepressants, opioids, CNS stimulants, 5-HT   agonists (a drug that changes the receptors of serotonin), psychedelics, herbs, and many others.
Brain death;1;Brain death means that the brain has stopped working.
Brain death;2;Brain death is permanent, and cannot be cured or reversed.
Brain death;3;No treatment can help.
Brain death;4;When a person is brain dead, there is no activity in any part of their brain.
Brain death;5;"Every part of the brain is dead; no oxygen flows to the brain, and there is no electrical activity in any part of the brain."
Brain death;6;The brain controls everything we need to do to stay alive.
Brain death;7;For example, it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, and many other important things.
Brain death;8;When a person is brain dead, their brain cannot control any of these things.
Brain death;9;A brain-dead person cannot breathe on their own.
Brain death;10;They will never be able to wake up or be aware of what is going on around them.
Brain death;11;Sometimes, brain-dead people are kept alive with special machines and medications.
Brain death;12;For example, doctors can put a tube down a person's throat and use a machine called a ventilator to pump oxygen into their lungs.
Brain death;13;While these machines can keep the person's other organs alive for a while, they cannot help the brain get better.
Brain death;14;Eventually, the person's other organs will stop working too.
Brain death;15;Doctors can diagnose brain death by examining the patient.
Brain death;16;They will check for reflexes which are controlled by the brainstem, and see if the person can breathe on their own.
Brain death;17;If the person is brain-dead, the doctor will find:   The person has no reflexes (for example, they do not gag when the doctor touches the back of their throat)   The person's pupils do not change size in bright light or in the dark   The person does not move or react when the doctor does something painful (like pinching the person's skin)   The person does not try to breathe on their own   Before diagnosing brain death, doctors will check for any other problem that could look like brain death (for example, a very low body temperature, or an overdose of sedatives).
Brain death;18;They will usually wait six to 24 hours before checking again to make sure the person still has no signs of activity in the brain.
Brain death;19;Then a second doctor is called in to do the same tests.
Brain death;20;"If both doctors agree, the patient can officially be diagnosed "" brain dead. """
Brain death;21;Sometimes, doctors use other tests which can diagnose brain death right away.
Brain death;22;These tests include:   EEG, which records the electrical activity in the brain.
Brain death;23;A brain-dead person will have no electrical activity in their brain.
Brain death;24;Brain scans like CT scans.
Brain death;25;A brain-dead person will have no blood flowing to their brain.
Brain death;26;Brain death happens because of an injury to the entire brain.
Brain death;27;The most common causes are:   A very bad head injury   A stroke which cut off the brain's oxygen supply or caused bleeding in the brain   Swelling in the brain, either from an infection like encephalitis, or from the brain not getting enough oxygen.
Brain death;28;Swelling or bleeding in the brain can cut off blood flow to the brain and push on the brainstem.
Brain death;29;If it gets bad enough, it can crush the brainstem.

Bursitis;1;Bursitis is a painful condition.
Bursitis;2;Small sacs called bursae get inflamed.
Bursitis;3;Bursae are pockets between your muscles and your bones.
Bursitis;4;Your bursa help you move without pain.
Bursitis;5;In bursitis, the inflammation is often caused by extra fluid in the bursae.
Bursitis;6;The most common places to have bursitis are in your hip and shoulder.
Bursitis;7;You can also have bursitis in your elbow, knee and toe.
Bursitis;8;One of the most common symptoms of bursitis is pain.
Bursitis;9;It can also cause stiffness and swelling.
Bursitis;10;Pain happens when you move your joints.
Bursitis;11;The most common cause of bursitis is moving your joints too much.
Bursitis;12;Swelling can happen when the joint locks.
Bursitis;13;There are a few ways to treat bursitis.
Bursitis;14;The best way to treat bursitis is to rest the joint and to lift it up.
Bursitis;15;You can also put a medicine called cortisone into the hurt bursa.
Bursitis;16;You should put it on ice for twenty minutes three to four times a day.
Intracranial hemorrhage;1;An intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain.
Intracranial hemorrhage;2;"( "" Intracranial "" means "" inside the skull "" ; "" hemorrhage "" means "" dangerous bleeding "" )."
Intracranial hemorrhage;3;The most dangerous type of stroke, a hemorrhagic stroke, is a type of intracranial hemorrhage.
Intracranial hemorrhage;4;It is a bleed in the brain that happens when the brain has not been injured.
Intracranial hemorrhage;5;When blood vessels in the brain break or are injured, they bleed.
Intracranial hemorrhage;6;Bleeding in the brain is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain.
Intracranial hemorrhage;7;It can also make it impossible for oxygen to get past the blood to parts of the brain.
Intracranial hemorrhage;8;Without oxygen, these parts of the brain will die.
Intracranial hemorrhage;9;Bleeding in the brain can happen for two reasons.
Intracranial hemorrhage;10;It can happen because of a head injury.
Intracranial hemorrhage;11;A bad head injury can break some of the blood vessels in the brain.
Intracranial hemorrhage;12;Bleeding in the brain can also happen when blood vessels in the brain break without being injured.
Intracranial hemorrhage;13;For example, this may happen when a cerebral aneurysm bursts.
Intracranial hemorrhage;14;The three most common types of bleeding problems in the brain are epidural hematomas, subdural hematomas, and subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Intracranial hemorrhage;15;These happen in different parts of the meninges (the layers that cover the brain).
Intracranial hemorrhage;16;An epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull.
Intracranial hemorrhage;17;"( "" Epidural "" means "" on top of the dura; "" a "" hematoma "" is a collection of blood.)"
Intracranial hemorrhage;18;Usually, injuries to the head cause epidural hematomas by tearing arteries in the dura.
Intracranial hemorrhage;19;Because the arteries in the dura are large, they carry a lot of blood.
Intracranial hemorrhage;20;If one of these arteries is injured, it can bleed very quickly, and an epidural hematoma can build up almost right away.
Intracranial hemorrhage;21;About 15% to 20% of people with epidural hematomas die from them.
Intracranial hemorrhage;22;The picture at the top of this page shows an epidural hematoma.
Intracranial hemorrhage;23;The bleeding (shown in light gray) is between the skull (the thick white outside layer) and the rest of the brain (shown in dark gray).
Intracranial hemorrhage;24;A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood under the dura mater, between the dura and the arachnoid layer.
Intracranial hemorrhage;25;"( "" Subdural "" means "" under the dura. """
Intracranial hemorrhage;26;) Usually, subdural hematomas are caused by injuries to the head that tear veins.
Intracranial hemorrhage;27;Because these veins are smaller, and because veins do not bleed as fast as arteries, subdural hematomas may not bleed as quickly as epidural hematomas.
Intracranial hemorrhage;28;Subdural hematomas can happen right away after a bad injury to the head.
Intracranial hemorrhage;29;These are called acute subdural hematomas.
Intracranial hemorrhage;30;These are the most dangerous of all head injuries.
Intracranial hemorrhage;31;They kill about 60% to 80% of people who have them.
Intracranial hemorrhage;32;Subdural hematomas can also be chronic.
Intracranial hemorrhage;33;This means they take days or weeks to happen.
Intracranial hemorrhage;34;They are usually caused by injuries to the head that are not very bad.
Intracranial hemorrhage;35;Sometimes, if a person has a vein in their dura that slowly leaks blood every now and then, chronic subdural hematomas can take years to build up.
Intracranial hemorrhage;36;A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater).
Intracranial hemorrhage;37;"( "" Subarachnoid "" means "" under the arachnoid. """
Intracranial hemorrhage;38;) Because the subarachnoid space holds cerebrospinal fluid, bleeding here makes blood mix into the cerebrospinal fluid.
Intracranial hemorrhage;39;The blood irritates the brain and spinal cord, and causes symptoms like a very bad headache and a stiff neck.
Intracranial hemorrhage;40;Subarachnoid hemorrhages can be caused by head injuries.
Intracranial hemorrhage;41;They can also happen when an aneurysm in one of the arachnoid layer's blood vessels bursts and starts bleeding.
Intracranial hemorrhage;42;Subarachnoid hemorrhages are very dangerous.
Intracranial hemorrhage;43;About half of all people with subarachnoid hemorrhages die from them.
Intracranial hemorrhage;44;About 10% to 15% die before they even get to the hospital.
Intracranial hemorrhage;45;Many of the people who survive have brain damage.

Legionnaires' disease;3;The length of time between exposure to the bacteria and the appearance of symptoms is generally two to ten days.
Legionnaires' disease;4;It can be as much as 20 days.
Legionnaires' disease;5;People with Legionnaires' usually have fever, chills, and a cough.
Legionnaires' disease;6;Some also have muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting.
Legionnaires' disease;7;People of any age may have Legionnaires' disease.
Legionnaires' disease;8;It is most common in middle aged and older people.
Somnolence;1;Somnolence (also sleepiness or drowsiness) is a strong desire for sleep.
Somnolence;2;It is also sleeping for unusually long periods.
Somnolence;3;It can refer to the usual state before falling asleep.
Somnolence;4;It can be accompanied by lethargy, weakness and difficulty thinking.
Somnolence;5;Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle.
Allergic rhinitis;1;Allergic rhinitis (also known as hay fever or pollinosis) is a type of inflammation in the nose.
Allergic rhinitis;2;It occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air.
Allergic rhinitis;3;Symptoms include sneezing, red, itchy and watery eyes, and swelling around the eyes.
Allergic rhinitis;4;Allergens that often cause hay fever include pollen, pet hair and mold.
Allergic rhinitis;5;Hay fever is most common between ages twenty and forty.
Cancer of unknown primary origin;1;"Cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP, "" occult cancer "" ) is a term used to describe a cancer  that is said to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis, but a primary tumor cannot be identified."
Cancer of unknown primary origin;2;A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor.
Cancer of unknown primary origin;3;CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances.
Cancer of unknown primary origin;4;The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment.
Cerebrovascular disease;1;Cerebrovascular disease, stroke or cerebrovascular accident, is a vascular disease of the cerebral circulation.
Cerebrovascular disease;2;Arteries supplying oxygen to the brain are affected resulting in one of a number of cerebrovascular diseases.
Cerebrovascular disease;3;Most commonly this is a stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes can be a hemorrhagic stroke.
Cerebrovascular disease;4;Any of these can result in vascular dementia.
Cerebrovascular disease;5;Causes of cerebrovascular disease can be divided into: atherosclerosis, embolism, aneurysms, low flow states, and other rare causes.
Cerebrovascular disease;6;Major modifiable risk factors include:   hypertension   smoking   obesity   diabetes.
Cerebrovascular disease;7;Treatment for cerebrovascular disease includes medication, lifestyle changes and surgery.
Cerebrovascular disease;8;Examples of medications are:   Antiplatelets (Aspirin, Clopidogrel)   Blood thinners (Heparin, Warfarin )   Antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, Beta blockers)   Anti-diabetic medications   Surgical procedures include:   Endovascular surgery and Vascular surgery (for future stroke prevention)   Walter Cronkite, American news journalist.

Ureteral cancer;1;Ureteral cancer is cancer of the ureters, muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
Ureteral cancer;2;It is also known as ureter cancer, renal pelvic cancer, and rarely ureteric cancer or uretal cancer.
Ureteral cancer;3;This kind of cancer is very rare.
Ureteral cancer;4;Ureteral cancer is usually transitional cell carcinoma.
Ureteral cancer;5;"Transitional cell carcinoma is "" a common cause of ureter cancer and other urinary (renal pelvic) tract cancers. """
Bronchospasm;1;Bronchospasm or a bronchial spasm is a sudden tightening of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles.
Bronchospasm;2;It is caused by the release (degranulation) of substances from mast cells or basophils because of anaphylatoxins.
Bronchospasm;3;It causes difficulty in breathing which can be very mild to severe.
Bronchospasm;4;Bronchospasms can be caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis and anaphylaxis.
Bronchospasm;5;Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a breathing tube during general anesthesia.
Bronchospasm;6;Some of the things that can cause bronchospasms are: consuming foods, taking medicines, allergic responses to insects, and hormone levels, particularly in women.
Hypersensitivity;1;redirect allergy
Acute myeloid leukemia;1;Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells.
Acute myeloid leukemia;2;It is the rapid growth of uncommon white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and harm the production of normal blood cells.
Acute myeloid leukemia;3;AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults.
Appendix cancer;1;Appendix cancer or appendiceal cancers are rare malignancies of the vermiform appendix.
Appendix cancer;2;Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare tumors with malignant potential.
Appendix cancer;3;Primary lymphomas can occur in the appendix.
Appendix cancer;4;Breast cancer, colon cancer, and tumors of the female genital tract may metastasize to the appendix.
Gastrointestinal cancer;1;Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus.
Gastrointestinal cancer;2;The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems.
Gastrointestinal cancer;3;The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue.
Gastrointestinal cancer;4;The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere.
Gastrointestinal cancer;5;These factors also determine the prognosis.

Thrombus;1;A thrombus, also called a blood clot, is the final product of the coagulation step in hemostasis.
Thrombus;2;There are two parts to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein.
Thrombus;3;The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor.
Thrombus;4;A thrombus is a healthy response to injury to prevent bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when clots blocks blood flow through healthy blood vessels.
Sinusitis;1;Sinusitis means infection or inflammation of the sinuses, which are air-filled spaces inside the bones of the face.
Sinusitis;2;There are many symptoms, including thick nasal mucus, a plugged nose, and pain in the face.
Heart block;1;Heart block is a type of heart disease.
Heart block;2;The human heart uses electrical signals to make the heart beat.
Heart block;3;Electricity travels down pathways in the heart to make each part of the heart beat at the right time.
Heart block;4;When a person has a heart block, there is a “block” in one of these electrical pathways.
Heart block;5;This blocks electricity from travelling normally through the heart.
Heart block;6;This makes the heart beat more slowly.
Heart block;7;In the most serious cases, the heart’s electrical pathways are blocked so badly that electricity cannot travel through the heart.
Heart block;8;This means the heart’s electrical signals cannot control how the heart beats, or cannot make the heart beat at all.
Heart block;9;Many people with heart block have no symptoms at all.
Heart block;10;Other people only have symptoms every once in a while.
Heart block;11;Sometimes, their heart might skip a beat.
Heart block;12;"This can make the person feel dizzy; faint; or have palpitations (feel their heart pounding)."
Heart block;13;In the most serious cases of heart block, a person's heart cannot control their heart beats.
Heart block;14;These cases can be treated with an artificial pacemaker.
Heart block;15;This is a medical device that is placed into the heart.
Heart block;16;It sends electrical signals to make the heart beat regularly.
Heart block;17;Some people are born with heart block.
Heart block;18;This is called a congenital heart block.
Heart block;19;More often, people get heart block later in life.
Heart block;20;Heart block can be caused by:   Other types of heart disease, like a heart attack   Some infections, like diphtheria   Some medicines, like beta-blockers (a type of medicine for high blood pressure)   Having open-heart surgery   There are three main types of heart block.
Heart block;21;This is the least serious type of heart block.
Heart block;22;It usually causes no symptoms.
Heart block;23;In second-degree heart block, it takes longer and longer for the heart to send electrical signals from the middle of the heart to the ventricles, which pump blood to the body.
Heart block;24;Eventually, this leads to a skipped heart beat.
Heart block;25;This can cause dizziness and fainting.
Heart block;26;This is the most serious type of heart block.
Heart block;27;It is also called a complete heart block.
Heart block;28;In this type of heart block, no electrical signals reach the heart's ventricles.
Heart block;29;This means that the electrical signals cannot make the heart pump blood to the body.
Heart block;30;Some people with third-degree heart block may have very few symptoms and may not need treatment.
Heart block;31;However, some people with third-degree heart block have many different symptoms.
Heart block;32;Third-degree heart block can be a medical emergency.
Heart block;33;This type of heart block may be treated with a pacemaker.
Heart block;34;Heart block can be diagnosed with an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or an EKG).
Heart block;35;This is a painless test.
Heart block;36;During the test, pads are placed on a person's chest, arms, and legs.
Heart block;37;They record the heart's electrical activity.
Heart block;38;A cardiologist can help diagnose heart block and order other tests if they are needed.
Heart block;39;Heart   Heart disease   Cardiac arrhythmia
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;1;Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, also called postural tachycardia syndrome) is a medical problem.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;2;When a person has POTS, their heart beats faster than normal when they stand up.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;3;POTS may also cause many other symptoms.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;4;"Postural means that POTS symptoms depend on a person's posture (their position - for example, whether they are lying down or standing up)   Orthostatic means that a person is standing up   Tachycardia means that a person's heart is beating faster than normal   A syndrome is a group of symptoms   Put together, the words "" postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome "" mean that when a person stands up, they get tachycardia, and they also have other symptoms."
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;5;When a healthy person stands up, their heart beats faster for a little while.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;6;It does this to push blood to the brain.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;7;Then the person's heart rate goes back to normal.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;8;When a person with POTS stands up, their heart beats much faster than normal.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;9;POTS is diagnosed when a person's heart rate increases by at least 30 beats per minute within 10 minutes after they stand up.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;10;This is called postural tachycardia.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;11;People with POTS also have other symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (symptoms that get worse when a person is standing up, and get better when the person is lying down).
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;12;These symptoms may include:   Palpitations (feeling the heart pounding)   Feeling dizzy, fainting, or almost fainting   Chest pain   Trouble breathing, especially when exercising   Feeling very weak or tired   Blurred vision (not being able to see clearly)   Headache   Trouble concentrating or thinking   Nausea   Trouble sleeping   Pallor (pale skin) or sweating   Symptoms may get worse if a person with POTS:   Sits for a long time   Stands for a long time   Drinks alcohol or caffeine   Gets too hot   Exercises too much   Eats a large meal   POTS can be caused by many different things.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;13;Many of these causes are not well understood.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;14;Some of the known causes of POTS include:   Genetics   Recently being sick with a virus   Chronic diabetes   Hypovolemia (not having enough blood in the body).
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;15;This causes less blood to get to the heart.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;16;The body tries to fix this by making the heart beat faster, so more blood will get pushed into the heart.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;17;Problems with the nerves in the lower legs.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;18;This causes blood to pool in the lower legs.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;19;The body tries to fix this by making the heart beat faster so it can push more blood to the rest of the body.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;20;POTS is more common in:   Women between the ages of 15 and 50   People who have recently been pregnant, had surgery, had a recent trauma, or had to rest in bed for a long time   People who have had autoimmune diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, anemia, hyperthyroidism, fibromyalgia, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and cancer   There are many different treatments for the symptoms of POTS.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;21;Some of these treatments include:   Drinking a lot of water (this increases the amount of fluid in the body, which helps blood get to the heart more easily)   Eating a high-salt diet (this helps keep fluid in the body and helps people with POTS from getting dehydrated)   Getting exercise, especially exercise like recumbent bicycling (bicycling while lying back, which prevents symptoms caused by being upright)   Using compression stockings (very tight socks) to keep blood from pooling in the legs   Avoiding things that can make POTS worse, like getting dehydrated, exercising too much, eating large meals, drinking alcohol, or getting too hot   No medications have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat POTS.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;22;"However, sometimes doctors treat POTS with medications that:   Prevent the body from losing salt;   Raise blood pressure; and/or   Keep the heart from pumping too fast."
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;23;Most people with POTS are able to get better with treatment.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;24;About 6 out of every 10 people with POTS is able to recover within 5 years of being diagnosed with POTS.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;25;About 9 out of every 10 people with POTS have some improvement with a combination of physical treatments and medicines.
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome;26;However, some people with POTS do not get better, and may even get worse over time.

Ataxia;1;Ataxia is trouble with balance that is not caused by a person's muscles being weak.
Ataxia;2;Instead, ataxia is caused by a neurological problem.
Ataxia;3;Ataxia is not a diagnosis.
Ataxia;4;It is a neurological sign.
Ataxia;5;It is a sign of damage to the parts of the nervous system that control balance.
Ataxia;6;There are three different types of ataxia.
Ataxia;7;Each type has many possible causes.
Ataxia;8;Cerebellar ataxia is ataxia that is caused by a problem with a person's cerebellum.
Ataxia;9;The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination.
Ataxia;10;It makes the body move smoothly and controls movements like walking.
Ataxia;11;People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble with actions like these:   Controlling how hard their muscles contract, how fast, and in what direction   Getting their muscles to work together (asynergy)   Walking (gait abnormality)   Moving their eyes   Swallowing (dysphagia)   Saying words (dysarthria)   Judging how far away something is (dysmetria)   Reacting quickly   Sensory ataxia is caused by the loss of proprioception (knowing where parts of the body are).
Ataxia;12;It is usually caused by damage to the parts of the spinal cord that carry information about proprioception to the brain.
Ataxia;13;However, it can also be caused by damage to the parts of the brain that receive that information (the cerebellum, the thalamus, and the parietal lobes of the brain).
Ataxia;14;A person with sensory ataxia may have these symptoms:   They may have trouble walking.
Ataxia;15;They may stomp their feet and hit their heels hard against the ground while they walk   Trouble walking that gets worse when the person cannot see well   For example, if the person stands with their feet together and their eyes closed, their balance problems will get much worse, and they may fall.
Ataxia;16;"Doctors call this a "" positive Romberg's test."
Ataxia;17;Vestibular ataxia is caused by problems with the vestibular system.
Ataxia;18;This is the body's main sensory system that controls balance and movement.
Ataxia;19;It includes the inner ear.
Ataxia;20;Along with balance problems, people with vestibular ataxia may have:   Nausea and vomiting   Dizziness   There are many different causes of ataxia.
Ataxia;21;The National Ataxia Foundation breaks up these causes into three categories: acquired, genetic, and idiopathic.
Ataxia;22;A person is not born with acquired ataxia.
Ataxia;23;Acquired means that something happened during the person's life to cause the ataxia.
Ataxia;24;Causes of acquired ataxia can include:   Stroke, brain tumor, or multiple sclerosis   A person can acquire (get) any of the three types of ataxia from these problems in the brain, depending on where the problem happens.
Ataxia;25;For example, if a person has a brain tumor in their cerebellum, they may get cerebellar ataxia.
Ataxia;26;If the tumor is in the vestibular system, the person may get vestibular ataxia.
Ataxia;27;Spinal cord injuries   Problems that damage parts of the cerebellum.
Ataxia;28;These problems can include:   Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or use of certain medications which can cause ataxia   Hypothyroidism   Head injury   Viral illnesses, like viral meningitis   Celiac disease   Mercury poisoning   Radiation poisoning   Vitamin B12 deficiency (not having enough vitamin B12 in the body)   Genetic ataxia is caused by hereditary disorders that damage the cerebellum or spine.
Ataxia;29;People are born with these disorders.
Ataxia;30;In most cases, they get worse over time.
Ataxia;31;Idiopathic means that doctors cannot find a cause for a person's ataxia.
Ataxia;32;Idiopathic ataxias often cause symptoms that come and go.
Ataxia;33;Many doctors and scientists think these ataxias are caused by a combination of things inside the body (like gene problems) and things outside the body (like the things happening in a person's life).
Ataxia;34;However, they are still researching the causes of idiopathic ataxias.
Ataxia;35;Ataxia can be treated.
Ataxia;36;However, treatment usually does not make ataxia go away completely.
Ataxia;37;Some treatments for ataxia include: A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009.
Ataxia;38;Medications   Physical therapy   Occupational therapy   Using a cane or walker to help with balance   Some people with severe ataxia may need to use wheelchairs.
Ataxia;39;Balance   Proprioception   Cerebellum   Spinal cord   Vestibular system
Tinnitus;1;Tinnitus is a symptom of hearing loss and other hearing problems.
Tinnitus;2;It is described as hearing sound in the head or ears that does not come from an outside source.
Tinnitus;3;Many people will hear ringing, buzzing, hissing or whistling sounds, but tinnitus can be other sounds such as roaring and humming as well.
Tinnitus;4;Different people will hear different sounds from tinnitus but how they hear it can also be different.
Tinnitus;5;Tinnitus can be loud or quiet and it can be continuous or occasional and some people will not notice their tinnitus but some people become very annoyed from it, especially when then feel tired or stressed.
Tinnitus;6;There are many things that can cause people to get tinnitus.
Tinnitus;7;These are the main reasons:   Listening to loud noises   Extreme stress   Old age   Some diseases   Some medicines   People of different range of age can develop tinnitus.
Tinnitus;8;It is not a disorder but the symptom of some underlying health condition.
Tinnitus;9;People with tinnitus may take part in yoga, exercise regularly, perform sound therapies or join a tinnitus community .
Tinnitus;10;Playing a faint background noise in the background also helps in keeping the phantom noise at bay.

Conductive hearing loss;1;Conductive hearing loss is one of the main types of hearing loss.
Conductive hearing loss;2;It happens when sound is blocked from going through the outer and middle ear into the inner ear and will only make noises sound less loud.
Conductive hearing loss;3;Most of the time, conductive hearing loss can be treated but how it is treated depends on the causes and is different for everyone.
Conductive hearing loss;4;Ear infections - some infections can cause the ear to swell and can make pus that blocks the ears   Ruptured ear drums - a hole in the ear drum that makes it harder for sound to travel through the ears   Objects blocking ear canal - some objects such as cotton tips and sometimes even ear wax can block the ears   Medical - some ear infections can be treated by medicine   Surgery - sometimes surgery is needed to remove ojects that are blocking the ears   Hearing aids - since conductive hearing loss usually makes noises sound quieter, hearing aids can help by making the sounds louder for users   National Hearing Care Find an audiologist in Australia and get more information on hearing problems.
Conductive hearing loss;5;Bay Audiology Find an audiologist in New Zealand and get more information on hearing problems.
Noise-induced hearing loss;1;Noise induced hearing loss (NHL) is hearing loss caused by sounds that are too loud (high decibel level) and damage hearing cells in the ear.
Noise-induced hearing loss;2;This can make noises sound quieter as well as make noise less clear, it can also cause other hearing related symptoms such as tinnitus.
Noise-induced hearing loss;3;NHL is permanent and cannot usually be restored.
Noise-induced hearing loss;4;Most of the time, NHL happens after being around a lot of noise for long periods of time.
Noise-induced hearing loss;5;Listening to loud music, city traffic or even things like a hair dryer for can damage hearing after a while.
Noise-induced hearing loss;6;But NHL can also happen suddenly when close to an extremely loud sound.
Noise-induced hearing loss;7;This can come from things like being close to an airplane or a gunshot.
Noise-induced hearing loss;8;Hearing is a very important sense.
Noise-induced hearing loss;9;It can be hard to notice hearing loss, especially if it happens over time instead of suddenly.
Noise-induced hearing loss;10;Even if it is hard for a person experiencing it to notice, it will still have a large effect on their life.
Noise-induced hearing loss;11;Not being able to hear a conversation when there is a lot of noise around is usually a good sign of hearing loss.
Noise-induced hearing loss;12;Other people may sound like they are speaking softly or their speech may not be clear.
Noise-induced hearing loss;13;Both of these can be signs of NHL.
Noise-induced hearing loss;14;Similarly, having to ask people to repeat themselves and having to try very hard to hear people speak are also signs.
Noise-induced hearing loss;15;Apart from not being able to hear very well when talking to other people, there are other signs of NHL such as tinnitus as well as some other diseases and medication.
Noise-induced hearing loss;16;Since NHL causes permanent damage, knowing the signs and causes of it and preventing it early is the only way to keep hearing healthy.
Noise-induced hearing loss;17;Lowering the volume of sound is a good way to start.
Noise-induced hearing loss;18;Even though controlling the level of sound heard is not always possible, when listening to music or watching movies it can be done and will keep hearing from being damaged.
Noise-induced hearing loss;19;If controlling the level of sound is not possible then avoiding being around loud sound for a long time will help too.
Noise-induced hearing loss;20;This is because the level of sound is not the only thing that is important for hearing loss, how long this loud sound is present is important as well.
Noise-induced hearing loss;21;If none of the above methods to prevent hearing loss are possible, then using earplugs or earmuffs is a must.
Noise-induced hearing loss;22;This will reduce the sound that is able to reach and cause damage to the ears.
Noise-induced hearing loss;23;This is useful for people who work in places that are loud such as a construction site.
Noise-induced hearing loss;24;Although NHL is permanent and most of the time cannot be cured, there are ways to manage it.
Noise-induced hearing loss;25;The most common thing to do is use hearing aids.
Noise-induced hearing loss;26;Hearing aids can help with hearing loss by making sound louder and speech clearer.
Noise-induced hearing loss;27;They can also be customised by audiologists to suit almost any lifestyle and to suit the specific needs of different people.
Presbycusis;1;Presbycusis is a type of sensorineural hearing loss which is caused by natural aging.
Presbycusis;2;Presbycusis occurs over time, becoming worse as people age and can not be reversed.
Presbycusis;3;It is the most common form of hearing loss and the second most common illness among older people, effecting up to 1 in 3 people by the age of 65.
Presbycusis;4;As a form of hearing loss, presbyusis will result in a decreased ability to hear sounds.
Presbycusis;5;Since it is a form of hearing loss that occurs over time, many people do not realise that they are affected and continue to believe that their hearing is normal.
Presbycusis;6;There are symptoms however that provide clear signs that hearing loss is present.
Presbycusis;7;Sounds, and speech becoming unclear   Speech becoming harder to understand, especially of children and women   Needing to increase volume when using TV, listening to music and the radio   Difficulty focusing on sounds when there is a lot of background noise   Tinnitus   Communication for people who are experiencing presbycusis usually will become a lot more difficult.
Presbycusis;8;Although noises may still sound loud, it is common that with this hearing loss, the sounds will not be clear.
Presbycusis;9;This is especially true when hearing high-pitched or high-frequency sounds.
Presbycusis;10;Unlike other forms of hearing loss such as noise-induced hearing loss it is a normal part of aging.
Presbycusis;11;Even though it occurs naturally, there are factors that can make it worse and make it happen earlier in life.
Presbycusis;12;Presbycusis is usually a form of sensorineural hearing loss, which means that it is due to problems in the inner ear or the hearing nerve due to loss or damage to the hair cells that line the inner ear.
Presbycusis;13;The most common causes of sensorineural hearing loss are exposure to loud noise for long periods of time as well as some diseases.
Presbycusis;14;Most hearing loss can both be prevented or managed if the proper precautions are taken.
Presbycusis;15;Noise-induced hearing loss in particular, coming from exposure to loud sounds can be prevented by using protection as well as avoidance   Hearing loss can be managed through the use of hearing aids and is used by many elderly people experiencing presbycusis.
Presbycusis;16;Hearing aids are not only able to increase sound levels but also separate an increase relevant sounds, making them very useful in helping with hearing.
Presbycusis;17;National Hearing Care Find an audiologist in Australia for more information on hearing problems.
Presbycusis;18;Bay Audiology Find an audiologist in New Zealand for more information on hearing problems.
Hyperacusis;1;Hyperacusis is a hearing health problem where people become more sensitive to some sounds for certain frequencies and volumes.
Hyperacusis;2;This can make everyday sounds such as a car, dishwasher or refrigerator sound very loud.
Hyperacusis;3;It is usually very difficult to tolerate and can be uncomfortable or even painful for people experiencing it.
Hyperacusis;4;The increasing sensitivity of the ears caused by hyperacusis is usually painful for many people.
Hyperacusis;5;Not only can it negatively effect the everyday lives of people experiencing it, it can for some make it very difficult and even not possible to do their everyday jobs and take care of their responsibilities.
Hyperacusis;6;There are many symptoms experienced by those with hyperacusis.
Hyperacusis;7;Annoyance or pain caused by noise that sounds normal to other people.
Hyperacusis;8;Often quiet sounds are not a problem whereas normal conversations can be too loud   Low sounds can still be too loud   Dizziness and nausea from loud sounds   Tinnitus affects a large portion - up to 89% - of those experiencing hyperacusis.
Hyperacusis;9;Loud sounds can make tinnitus for these people worse   Similarly to other hearing problems, hyperacusis can occur suddenly or gradually over time and is a problem that can affect people of all different ages in one or both ears.
Hyperacusis;10;Again, like other forms of hearing problems, there are a variety of possible causes ranging from exposure to noise and other diseases.
Hyperacusis;11;Extremely loud one-time sounds such as an explosion   Head injury or damage such as caused by a fall or slap   Long periods of exposure to loud sound   Ear surgery and other medical procedures   Diseases such as lyme disease and some medications   Although these are the main causes of hyeracusis and can be seen as causes related to most hearing problems, there are other less common, possible causes such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
Hyperacusis;12;Hyperacusis cannot always be fully cured, but for most patients the symptoms get better with time and treatment.
Hyperacusis;13;Patients will need to learn to use hearing protection against sounds which are very loud, but to not use these in everyday situations.
Hyperacusis;14;Protecting the ears too much will make the symptoms worse instead of better.
Hyperacusis;15;Sound therapy is a popular form of treatment that is usually used to treat tinnitus.
Hyperacusis;16;It involves using a noise-generator to put sound into the ears at a soft level for periods of time throughout the day in order to build tolerance to the pain caused by hyperacusis and to make the ears hear in a normal way again.
Hyperacusis;17;Wear hearing protection in spaces with loud sounds to avoid pain   Short term medication   Counseling to better understand Hyperacusis and to learn not to overprotect the ears.
Angioedema;1;Angioedema is swelling that is similar to hives, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface.
Angioedema;2;Hives are often called welts.
Angioedema;3;They are a surface swelling.
Angioedema;4;It is possible to have angioedema without hives.
Angioedema;5;Angioedema may be caused by an allergic reaction.
Angioedema;6;During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis;6;Treatment to slow down the progression of the disease may include nintedanib or pirfenidone.
Pulmonary fibrosis;1;"Pulmonary fibrosis (literally "" scarring of the lungs "" ) is a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems."
Pulmonary fibrosis;2;Scar formation, the addition of extra fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads to thickening of the walls, and causes low oxygen supply in the blood.
Pulmonary fibrosis;3;As a result patients suffer from shortness of breath.
Pulmonary fibrosis;4;In some patients the cause of the disease can be diagnosed, but in others the cause is unknown, a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Cystocele;8;Women are at risk of having a cystocele if they have given birth, have a hard time with passing stool, have a chronic cough, lift heavy objects, Causes include childbirth, constipation, chronic cough, or have had other surgeries of the reproductive organs.
Cystocele;9;Other things that may cause cystocele is having a hysterectomy, a family history of cystocele and being overweight.
Cystocele;10;The reason why the bladder may bulge into the vagina is that the wall of the vagina becomes weak.
Cystocele;11;Sometimes a cystocele exists but does not cause difficulties.
Cystocele;12;Woemen who have more serious problems may be treated with a vaginal pessary or surgery.
Cystocele;13;Doing exercises with the pelvic muscles can help.

Coronavirus disease 2019;21;gas exchange.
Coronavirus disease 2019;22;The other, type II, produces surfactants, which help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc.
Coronavirus disease 2019;23;COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it.
Coronavirus disease 2019;24;Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs.
Coronavirus disease 2019;25;Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.
Coronavirus disease 2019;26;Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;27;They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs.
Coronavirus disease 2019;28;They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting.
Coronavirus disease 2019;29;The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels.
Coronavirus disease 2019;30;Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution.
Coronavirus disease 2019;31;One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;32;Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.
Coronavirus disease 2019;33;There are many ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;34;Washing hands for at least 20 seconds will help destroy the viruses.
Coronavirus disease 2019;35;Avoiding touching your own eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands is another way to avoid catching COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;36;People should avoid crowded places whenever possible, because close contact with large groups of people can easily spread the virus.
Coronavirus disease 2019;37;In fact, many health organizations say that people should stay at least two metres from another person..
Coronavirus disease 2019;38;Some people wear face masks to avoid catching the virus, and it is recommended by countries such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.
Coronavirus disease 2019;39;Experts recommend testing people for COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;40;Some people may have SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies but not feel sick right away.
Coronavirus disease 2019;41;These people can spread the virus to others.
Coronavirus disease 2019;42;There are two types of tests.
Coronavirus disease 2019;43;Viral tests show whether a person has the virus right then.
Coronavirus disease 2019;44;Antibody tests show whether the person had the virus and has since recovered.
Coronavirus disease 2019;45;A group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20 minutes.
Coronavirus disease 2019;46;They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019;47;The virus that causes COVID-19 is new to humans.
Coronavirus disease 2019;48;This means that there are no medicines that can stop people from getting COVID-19 or that can treat them if they do get it.
Coronavirus disease 2019;49;Scientists are working hard to invent and test new medicines.
Coronavirus disease 2019;50;Some scientists are trying to invent a new vaccine which would stop people from getting sick with COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;51;Other scientists are testing medicines used for other diseases to see if those medicines make people get less sick if they do get COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;52;In April 2020, the group Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said that scientists were looking at 115 compounds that could be a vaccine.
Coronavirus disease 2019;53;Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says it takes 18 months to test a vaccine to make sure it works and is safe.
Coronavirus disease 2019;54;In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc, and tested it in mice.
Coronavirus disease 2019;55;Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01.
Coronavirus disease 2019;56;They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue.
Coronavirus disease 2019;57;This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person.
Coronavirus disease 2019;58;"They added a protein called "" human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 "" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells."
Coronavirus disease 2019;59;They named their hrsACE2 APN01.
Coronavirus disease 2019;60;In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine.
Coronavirus disease 2019;61;The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked.
Coronavirus disease 2019;62;Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019;63;They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.
Coronavirus disease 2019;64;Other scientists are developing vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus.
Coronavirus disease 2019;65;They say mRNA vaccines will take less time to develop and make than protein or whole-virus vaccines.
Coronavirus disease 2019;66;In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal.
Coronavirus disease 2019;67;Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work.
Coronavirus disease 2019;68;The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people.
Coronavirus disease 2019;69;Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.
Coronavirus disease 2019;70;Some people thought hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, might work against COVID-19.
Coronavirus disease 2019;71;One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed.
Coronavirus disease 2019;72;Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else.
Coronavirus disease 2019;73;United States President Donald Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine and told other people to take it too, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, part of the White House official coronavirus task force, said no one could know for sure if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019;74;In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration allowed doctors to give hydroxychloroquine and another drug called chloroquine to COVID-19 patients, but in June, they told doctors to stop.
Coronavirus disease 2019;75;By then, more studies had shown that the drugs did not help much and could harm the patients' hearts.
Coronavirus disease 2019;76;Some scientists also think the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019;77;Remdesivir works against other viruses and it has already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better.
Coronavirus disease 2019;78;Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.
Coronavirus disease 2019;79;Doctors gave remdesivir to some COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available.
Coronavirus disease 2019;80;68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects.
Coronavirus disease 2019;81;But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.
Coronavirus disease 2019;82;The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.
Coronavirus disease 2019;83;Some scientists gave SARS and MERS to llamas so the llamas' immune systems would make antibodies, or natural medicines, against those viruses, and they found a few antibodies that worked.
Coronavirus disease 2019;84;In a May 2020 study, the scientists said this could work with SARS-CoV-2 too.

2009 flu pandemic;1;The 2009 flu pandemic or swine flu was an influenza pandemic that lasted from early 2009 to late 2010, and the second of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus (the first of them being the 1918–1920 Spanish flu pandemic).
2009 flu pandemic;2;First described in April 2009, the virus appeared to be a new strain of H1N1 which resulted when a previous triple reassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses.
2009 flu pandemic;3;It is said that 11–21% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million–1.4 billion people had the illness — more than the Spanish flu pandemic.
2009 flu pandemic;4;However, with about 150,000–575,000 fatalities, it had a much lower case fatality rate of 0.01-0.08%.
Bowel obstruction;1;Bowel obstruction, also known as intestinal obstruction, is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion.
Bowel obstruction;2;Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected.
Bowel obstruction;3;Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, bloating and not passing gas.
Carbon monoxide poisoning;1;Carbon monoxide poisoning happens from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at large levels.
Carbon monoxide poisoning;2;"Symptoms are often described as "" flu-like "" and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion."
Carbon monoxide poisoning;3;Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death.
Carbon monoxide poisoning;4;Carbon monoxide poisoning can be accidental, like if the oven's gas is left on by accident or a gas leak.
Carbon monoxide poisoning;5;However, it can often be used as a suicide method such as keeping the car on while in a closed garage.
Dizziness;1;Dizziness is a disability in spatial perception and stability.
Central nervous system disease;1;Central nervous system diseases, also known as central nervous system disorders, are a group of neurological disorders that affect the structure or function of the brain or spinal cord.
Central nervous system disease;2;They form the central nervous system (CNS).
Speech disorder;1;A speech disorder or speech impediment is a persistent communication problem, caused by problems with speaking.
Speech disorder;2;People with speech impairments have problems making certain sounds, forming words, or combining these words into sentences.
Speech disorder;3;Common speech impairments are stuttering and lisps.
Speech disorder;4;Someone who cannot speak at all is called mute.
Merkel-cell carcinoma;1;Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer happening in about 3 per 1,000,000 population.
Merkel-cell carcinoma;2;It is also known as cutaneous APUDoma, primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, primary small cell carcinoma of the skin, and trabecular carcinoma of the skin.
Merkel-cell carcinoma;3;Reasons why the cancer would form is because of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV), a weakened immune system, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Merkel-cell carcinoma;4;Merkel-cell carcinoma usually shows up on the head, neck, perianal and eyelid.
Merkel-cell carcinoma;5;It is more common in elderly people.
Interstitial cystitis;1;Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is a disease that causes pain in the bladder.
Choking;1;Choking happens when breathing is made difficult.
Choking;2;It happens when the windpipe is blocked.
Choking;3;In some cases the air flow is completely blocked, in other cases some amount of air can pass to the lungs.
Choking;4;Insufficient oxygen being delivered to the body will result in oxygen deprivation.
Choking;5;Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops.
Choking;6;Choking agent   Strangulation
Kawasaki disease;1;Kawasaki disease is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a fever and mainly affects children under 5 years of age.
Kawasaki disease;2;It is a form of vasculitis, where blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body.
Kawasaki disease;3;The fever typically lasts for more than five days.
Kawasaki disease;4;While the cause is unknown, it may be due to an infection triggering an autoimmune response.
Kawasaki disease;5;Boys are more commonly affected than girls.
Kawasaki disease;6;The disorder was first described in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan.

Pre-eclampsia;1;Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a disorder of pregnancy caused by the onset of high blood pressure.
Pre-eclampsia;2;There is a large amount of protein in the urine.
Pre-eclampsia;3;When it happens, the condition begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
Pre-eclampsia;4;In severe cases of the disease there may be red blood cell breakdown, a low blood platelet count, damaged liver function, kidney dysfunction, swelling, shortness of breath due to fluid in the lungs, or visual disturbances.
Pre-eclampsia;5;If left untreated, it may result in seizures.
Penetrating trauma;1;Penetrating trauma is an injury that occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body, creating an open wound.
Penetrating trauma;2;The penetrating object may remain in the tissues, come back out the way it entered, or pass through the tissues and exit from another area.
Penetrating trauma;3;An injury in which an object enters the body or a structure and passes all the way through is called a perforating injury, while penetrating trauma implies that the object does not pass through.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome;1;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure caused by a massive widespread inflammation in the lungs.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome;2;Symptoms include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and bluish skin color.
